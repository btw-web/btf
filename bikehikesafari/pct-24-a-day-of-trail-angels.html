<h1>PCT 24 A Day of Trail Angels</h1>

<p><strong><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">10th May 2015</span></strong></p>



<p><strong><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">Mileage 23.3</span></strong></p>



<p><strong><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">Little Jimmy Camp (384.3) Bushcamp (407.6)</span></strong></p>



<p><strong>PCT 400 miles</strong></p>



<p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">It was a rather crowded campsite last night. I picked what I thought was a quiet spot away from everybody. I executed the plan well until about 9pm a rather loud sound eminated from one of the two tents near me. </span></p>



<p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">It was quite possibly the loudest snoring I ever heard. Tink who was in the other tent near me thought there was a bear in the campsite. Suffice to say I didn&rsquo;t sleep well and was slow to make it onto the trail.</span></p>



<p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">I set off alone on the trail as it slowly descended through groves of Sugar Pines till it crossed the main highway. I then set off on an unwelcome climb upwards gaining 1500 feet in elevation. After yesterdays effort I was done with climbing but I acknowledge that this is not called the Pacific Valley Trail.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">The PCT then descended back to the road. Near this point I was forced to walk on the main highway. There is a rare and endangered frog surviving in a small pocket of forest near the trail. For protection this area is closed necessitating a road walk. This I did at speed to limit my time exposure to potentially dangerous drivers or more correctly wannabe motorbike racers.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">A short time after the road walk I passed another milestone, PCT 400 miles. The the big &lsquo;I would walk 500 miles&rsquo; is next. I was in a good mood due to my recent achievement. I reached a place called Camp Glenwood. Brad (cool name) called me over and asked if I wanted a burger. Of course I would I advised him. I started salivating immediately. </span></p>



<p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">I entered the small one room shack to be greeted by fellow hikers, Zig Zag, Houdini and Zarah (now known as Sobo). Max greeted me inside and asked if I wanted a burger or hot dog. I paused to answer. He asked if I would like one of each. Again I paused. &nbsp;He said &ldquo;ok, one of each of is&rdquo;. </span></p>



<p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">I was in total agreement with him. He thrust a cold beer in my hand and offered me a donut while telling me that the Brownies were very nice. What was I to do other than accept this gracious offering. I was starving. </span></p>



<p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">After all the food and a second beer was consumed I found it hard to leave this slice of trail paradise. Three other hikers, Salamander, Treebeard and Forest arrived. It was too easy to stay but I thanked my very gracious hosts, left a donation and continued, if slowly down the trail.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">I was on the trail for less than 45 minutes before a trail runner stopped me to tell me that under his car in the car park only 5 minutes away was some Coke and other trail magic. &ldquo;Please help yourself&rdquo;, he told me. He took my photo then ran up the trail. I didn&rsquo;t even get his name. </span></p>



<p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">When I reached the said car park I was greeted by Ed from nearby Wrightwood. He offered me Gatorade and potato crisps. Wow. After chatting with him for a while all the others I met at Camp Glenwood arrived. I stayed and chatted with all for a while. They mentioned that the gent who left the coke under his car might be offended if we didn&rsquo;t drink them. So we did. I am unlikely to ever have a day like this again.</span></p>



<p><span style="line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);">Once again I am impressed with the unselfish generosity of the people that I meet. To you all I sincerely say, Thank You.</span></p>
