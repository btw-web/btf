<h1>PCT Day 90 The Call of the Wild</h1>

<p><strong>15th July 2015</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mileage 19.8</strong></p>



<p><strong>Old Station (1378.9) to Bushcamp (1398.7)</strong></p>



<p>I sat in JJs Cafe sipping my coffee when Mr &amp; Mrs Smith walked in. An hour earlier we tried to hitch hike the 3.5 miles from the RV Park. I was determined not to walk back. I left my backpack in the care of BearLee who decided to linger longer in the cabin. </p>



<p>After breakfast with Mr &amp; Mrs Smith I scanned the patrons and resolved myself to asking every customer for a lift. I was successful on my second attempt.</p>



<p>I waited around the post office for opening time. I had a package waiting, hopefully. I was itching to get on trail. I felt like more like a caged animal seeking the freedom in the wild than a civilised human. </p>



<p>Two showers in two days seemed somewhat unnecessary. I was clean yesterday and haven&rsquo;t done anything to make myself dirty or sweaty. Overindulgence. I feel the call of the wild.</p>



<p>Unfortunately my REI package didn&rsquo;t arrive. Things happen, move on, fix the problem later. It was 2pm when I hitch hiked down to JJs Cafe, again. Dino DNAs parents were visiting and were kind enough to assist me. </p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve been leap frogging Dino DNA (a fellow hiker) for several hundred miles. The staff at JJs Cafe called me family, I&rsquo;ve been there several times during my 48 hour layover at Old Station. I demolished a Chicken Ceasar Salad as quickly as possible then hit the trail. I have had a serious hankering for salad lately.</p>



<p>First stop was the nearby Lava Tubes, called Subway Caves. The whole area I&rsquo;m traversing is volcanic in nature. Not necessarily active right now but there is enough evidence of historic activity. Lava once flowed through the cave, I&rsquo;m not sure when but not in my lifetime. </p>



<p>While entering the cave my old hiking buddy BearLee was exiting the cave. He told me I could walk all the way through the cave to the other side, so I did. I love geology, well, all things in the natural world. Today was my first ever lava tube. Very excited.</p>



<p>The excitement continued as I departed the cave to hike one of the most notorious sections of the trail. The Hat Creek Rim. Famed as a long waterless stretch for over 30 miles, with little shade and extreme heat. As it was 3pm when I departed the cave I wasn&rsquo;t too worried about the heat. </p>



<p>In an attempt to catch up with my hiking family I hiked as fast as my skinny legs would take me. By late afternoon I bid farewell to BearLee, I may not see him again on trail due to my faster schedule, but I hope I do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the sun was setting just to the west of the highest volcanic mountain in Northern California, Mt Shasta, I rolled out my sleeping mat on a high exposed ridgeline. It was 9.10pm. </p>



<p>My legs were tired but my spirits had reached a new high. Only 20 minutes earlier I met my other old hiking buddy, and legend on the trail, Zig Zag. Camping in style, complete with a camp chair &lsquo;borrowed&rsquo; from a nearby water cache. I was very tempted to camp with him. Turns out I only made it one mile further.</p>



<p>I watched the orange glow fade from the sky as darkness approached. Venus and Jupiter were bright in the western sky till slowly the stars appeared.</p>



<p>Camping without a tent tonight and with no moon the stars were amazing. The Milky Way Galaxy was a bright long disc in the sky. I found it hard to close my eyes and sleep.</p>
