<h1>TA Day 43 &#8211; 44 Alpine crossing retreat</h1>

<p>5th-6th December</p>



<p>18.2km + 8.7km retreat</p>



<p>Tongariro Holiday Park 1094.4km to National Park 1112.6km.</p>



<p>The hail felt like little acupuncture needles pricking my face. I couldn&rsquo;t see where I was going. My gloves covered my unprotected eyes, not that there was anything to see when I was hiking in the clouds. The 70km/h winds made hiking difficult and I was starting to get cold. I was 200 meters from the top of the trail. What on earth was I doing here, I thought to myself, I have nothing to prove. I gladly turned round and made my way down to safety. Done days it&rsquo;s better to retreat and hike on another day rather than take the risk, today was that day for me.</p>



<p>The Te Araroa trail follows the most famous and arguably best day hike in New Zealand, the Tongariro crossing. On a good day it&rsquo;s world class alpine scenery with several active volcanoes and multi coloured lakes. On a bad day, its deadly. Two people have died on the trail since I arrived in New Zealand a couple of weeks ago, thankfully not TA hikers. More search and rescues occur here than any other part of New Zealand. I was wary, it is an alpine area that one should not take lightly.</p>

<p>Earlier, I woke to strong wind which buffeted my tent in the holiday park. I ate a huge breakfast and set off hiking. There was no cell phone reception in this part of the world, in fact the last weather report I had was from 2 days earlier. I set off into the relative unknown of the weather.</p>



<p>Several kilometers of roadwalking and I came to the start of the trail. It was quiet. Too quiet. No cars, no buses and no people. I set of up into the mountains. A 1100m (3600ft) gain in altitude lay ahead. A car arrived just as I started hiking, possibly I wouldn&rsquo;t be alone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/20181205_085914-012250713095734280274.jpeg" alt="" data-pin-media="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/20181205_085914-012250713095734280274.jpeg"></figure>



<p>The start of the trail went through forest that sheltered me from the wind. Within an hour the wind was gale force as I entered the alpine area with its stunted shrubs. Rain was approaching from my right and clouds shrouded the mountain peaks. Already it wasn&rsquo;t looking fun.</p>

<p>I reached Ketetahi hut in pouring rain. I was glad to get out of the weather. It&rsquo;s not my first visit to this hut. I slept here 20 years ago when I did a hike called the Tongariro Circuit. The best and most famous overnight hike on the north island of New Zealand. Now the hut is falling apart. But not from neglect.</p>



<p>In 2012, Mt Tongariro erupted after being dormant for over 100 years. It spewed lava bombs up to 1 meter across over parts of the trail I was hiking. 3 of these lave bombs crashed into the hut. One landed on the bed in the bedroom. Nobody was there but as a result, the hut is now closed to all but the wet hiker seeking short term respite.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1200" height="1009" src="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/20181205_112257-018773251886923165629.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-15392" srcset="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/20181205_112257-018773251886923165629.jpeg 1200w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/20181205_112257-018773251886923165629-300x252.jpeg 300w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/20181205_112257-018773251886923165629-770x647.jpeg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-pin-media="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/20181205_112257-018773251886923165629.jpeg"></figure>



<p>I waited 4 hours in the hut to see if the weather would turn. Any longer and I would run out of daylight to complete the hike to the next campsite. At 2pm there was a short break in the weather and I went for it. Not long after I made the prudent decision to get off the mountain. The stinging hail, low cloud, cold and wind made it unsafe.</p>

<p>I hitch hiked to the nearest village called National Park. A bed, shower, laundry and a beer felt oh so good. I felt good with my decision, even though it messed with my plans to go canoeing. I&rsquo;ll work that out later. Now I rest and wait for a weather window. Fortunately, I will not have to wait too long to return to the mountains. Looks like fine weather is coming in a couple of days. I&rsquo;ll give the crossing another go in good weather, stay tuned.</p>
