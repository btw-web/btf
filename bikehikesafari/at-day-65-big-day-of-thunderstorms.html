<h1>AT Day 65 &#8211; Big Day of Thunderstorms </h1>

<p>19th June&nbsp;</p>



<p>29.8 miles</p>



<p>Bushcamp (1151.3) to Bushcamp (1181.1)</p>



<p>The hot humid southerly wind kept blowing all night. Temperatures were rather tropical when I started hiking. Within 15 minutes I was dripping with sweat, every piece of clothing saturated. It was going to be a hard day.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1136" height="758" src="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight493.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11707" srcset="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight493.jpg 1136w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight493-300x200.jpg 300w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight493-770x514.jpg 770w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight493-360x240.jpg 360w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight493-370x247.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px" data-pin-media="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight493.jpg"></figure>



<p>The weather was cloudy with a hot humid wind blowing until around 11am. First came the distant thunder, then the strong cold wind. The sky went dark then it rained. Heavy rain. Torrential rain.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1200" height="802" src="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight494.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11708" srcset="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight494.jpg 1200w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight494-300x201.jpg 300w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight494-770x515.jpg 770w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight494-360x240.jpg 360w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight494-370x247.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-pin-media="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight494.jpg"></figure>



<p>Despite using my umbrella I was soaked. Which didn&rsquo;t matter because I was soaked from sweat before the downpour. Lightning was all around, as close as two seconds from the flash to the sound. I was walking along a high ridgeline but there was quite a covering of trees. At least I wasn&rsquo;t the highest point. The storm lasted all of 15 minutes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1136" height="758" src="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight495.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11709" srcset="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight495.jpg 1136w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight495-300x200.jpg 300w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight495-770x514.jpg 770w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight495-360x240.jpg 360w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight495-370x247.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px" data-pin-media="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight495.jpg"></figure>



<p>I continued hiking through the now wet trail after enjoying the brief cooling affect of the storm. The rain free period didn&rsquo;t last long. Another row of thunderstorms hit. This time it was not as strong. Just a bit of wind and rain with the odd flash of lightning every couple of minutes.</p>



<p>The third thunderstorm refused to dissipate. Steady rain continued for 2-3 hours. The rain wasn&rsquo;t heavy but it was enough to send hikers to put up their tents or head for the shelters to camp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I kept hiking. Every part of me was soaked. Toward the end of the day I entered a section of trail that said, No Camping. The wet weather was causing rather unpleasant rubbing on my upper thighs. I had to set up camp. It seemed that other hikers ignored the &lsquo;no camping sign&rsquo;. They were obviously locals, not hikers.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1136" height="852" src="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight499.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11712" srcset="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight499.jpg 1136w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight499-300x225.jpg 300w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight499-770x578.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px" data-pin-media="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/enlight499.jpg"></figure>



<p>I kept hiking away from the locals to a quieter spot. I could still hear them from about a mile away. I could also hear the frequent low pitched boom sounds coming from the nearby military range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rubbing between my legs needed a bit of first aid treatment before bed. It was rather painful. The last few steps of the day had me resembling a cowboy who&rsquo;d been on his horse all day. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be ok to hike tomorrow.<span id="selectionBoundary_1498004299340_35853865978866106" class="rangySelectionBoundary" style="line-height: 0; display: none;"></span></p>
