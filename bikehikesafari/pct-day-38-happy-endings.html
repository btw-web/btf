<h1>PCT Day 38 Happy Endings</h1>

<p><strong>24th May 2015</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mileage 27.1 (43.6km)</strong></p>



<p><strong>Joshua Tree Camp (624.3) to Walker Pass (651.4)</strong></p>



<p>I had some inside information that there was trail magic at Walker Pass. It was over 27 miles away and I wasn&rsquo;t sure I could make it that far with my sore ankle. But decided to try. I also had another problem, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have enough water to stay on trail another night. This section of the trail is the most brutal for its lack of water. It also promised to be a hot day.</p>



<p>I was hiking by 5.30am. That&rsquo;s the earliest I&rsquo;ve been on trail so far. I hiked for 2 hours before stopping to make coffee and some hot oats. This also lightened my still substantial water weight from my pack. </p>



<p>The trail still consisted of soft sand similar in consistency to beach sand. It was hard work. Then there was a climb that seemed to last for hours. Both my energy and water reserves were depleted very quickly.</p>



<p>At midday I had 15 miles to make it to Walker Pass which had the next water. I didn&rsquo;t think it possible but just kept walking. </p>



<p>A rattlesnake met me on the trail and was very polite in its method of warning me. It set its rattle in motion when I was about 4 paces away from it. The rattlesnake then courteously moves off the trail, all the while rattling to make me aware of its presence. They have been referred to as the &lsquo;Gentleman Snake&rsquo;. They warn you to move away prior to striking!</p>



<p>I continued making forward progress for the afternoon but realised I was getting low on both energy and water. With 4 miles to go I ran out of water. This coincided with lack of energy and sore feet and ankles. I stopped every mile to rest. It was hard work.</p>



<p>My first sight of Walker Pass was of a shelter draped with PCT flags. 3 trail Angels were there, including the well known &lsquo;Meadow Ed&rsquo;. He was one of the first trail angels. It was his 70th birthday, he chose to spend it with hikers. </p>



<p>We were treated to a several course meal. Not many people reading this can appreciate just how great it is to feel full after a meal. When on trail I just can&rsquo;t carry enough food. After several Dr Peppers, some beers, salad, 2 plates of pasta, bread, potato chips and 2 slices of birthday cake I went to bed full.</p>



<p>Despite my monetary donation and gracious thank you, I really truely am touched by how many people give their time and energy to provide help for tired, hungry, smelly, dirty hikers. Thank you.</p>



<p>By the way, I am now heading into remote sections of the trail with no phone service. So I&rsquo;ll will be unable to post or look at messages for a while. So be prepared for a lot of updates in about 10 days.</p>
