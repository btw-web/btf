<h1>Cancun to Atlanta</h1>

<p>I arrived in the tourist mecca of Cancun and checked into a small family run hostel. I had a couple of days until my flight which was enough time to get some much needed chores done. Firstly, I needed to somehow acquire a bike box. In the past I&rsquo;ve gone to bicycle stores and asked if they had any boxes that they were throwing out, normally it is not a problem. If that failed I could always find a furniture store or department store. A large cardboard box from a fridge, oven or large piece of furniture should work. But I didn&rsquo;t need to do any of that. The family that I stayed with had a bicycle box in their courtyard. A cyclist left it there a couple of weeks earlier when they arrived in Cancun Airport. I totally lucked out.</p>



<p>I also had a couple of last minute logistical things to organise, including completing my long overdue tax return. I might not have much in the way of income but it still had to be done. I did most of those chores in the comfort of the air conditioning at Starbucks. The mood music constantly told me to stay longer and have another coffee. How do they do that?</p>



<p>I had a stupid early flight from Cancun to Atlanta. My &Uuml;ber driver with his small car picked me up. My bicycle only just fit into the back of the vehicle, both the driver and myself were very happy with that. I arrived at the airport the evening before my flight and slept at the airport. It&rsquo;s not the first time I&rsquo;ve slept at an airport. I use a website called <a href="https://www.sleepinginairports.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://www.sleepinginairports.net/</a> to look at the airport information and see how comfortable I might be. Cancun airport was safe and I actually got a couple of hours of good sleep (<em>in short 15 minute cycles</em>) before my Delta Airlines flight.</p>



<p>I have now spent about 12 months of my life in Mexico. Cycling and exploring the country. During that time I&rsquo;ve learned enough of the language to communicate with the locals and I&rsquo;ve eaten a wide variety of Mexican food that most Mexicans don&rsquo;t even get to experience. One thing is for certain, Mexico is an amazing country and I&rsquo;m already making plans to return at the end of my hike on the Appalachian Trail. I&rsquo;m ready to go hiking. Let&rsquo;s go to Atlanta and go for a hike.</p>
