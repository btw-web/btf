<h1>PCT Day 15 Walking like a Robot</h1>

<p><strong>1st May 2015</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mileage 23.6</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bushcamp (238.1) to Bushcamp (261.7)</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hiking like a robot</strong></p>



<p>My big day yesterday came at a price. I may have proved to myself that I can put in the big hard days hiking, but backing it up the next day. Maybe not. My first steps in the morning must have looked more like C3-PO, the droid from Star Wars. I was hiking like a robot. My muscles and joints were both stiff and sore with little in the way of strength. But I kept moving, slowly, slowly.</p>



<p>After almost 2 hours I found a comfortable place to stop for my second breakfast with the tall trees and birds for company. When I finished and headed back on the trail I left my sunglasses behind. It was a 1 hour round trip to pick them up. Still to this moment I&rsquo;m questioning if it was worth the effort.</p>

<p>Like most places on the trail there were still some long distances between water stops. That meant a heavy pack. From the moment I broke camp I was intermittently walking in the shade of some grand trees. The weather was also pleasantly cool but not cold.</p>



<p>Sometimes I think as I write this that I am unable to convey how I may be feeling about the trail. Or the hardships that I face. I hope this doesn&rsquo;t come across as an easy hike. That, it is not. But so far I have been blessed with good health, good fitness and a healthy combination of determination, motivation and curiosity to experience the natural world. </p>



<p>I take pleasure in being more than a hiker. I observe the natural world. When I smell a flower in bloom, I stop and smell it. When a reptile or other animal is in view I stop to photograph it. </p>



<p>I observe, but am not familiar with the birds. I observe the trees and shrubs and likewise do not know what they are. I have documented most in my written diary, to be followed at a later date. Like a good naturalist might do. </p>



<p>I haven&rsquo;t really hiked with any naturalists yet, it might happen at some stage in the future. I may gather a better understanding of the natural world here. While I very familiar with most things in my part of the world, most things here are, obviously foreign to me.</p>

<p>By mid afternoon I stumbled upon some water caches and some surprises on trail. The water caches are non-natural water delivered on trail by helpful groups or individuals. </p>



<p>One cache contained not only water but bananas, cookies and various flavours of soft drinks. All to be enjoyed while lounging on a couch. Great job.</p>

<p>It was very noticeable to me that by late afternoon I was no longer walking like a robot but back to my strong, normal walking pace. I continued at this good pace until around 6pm when I stopped on the only flat ground I could find and made camp for the night. </p>



<p>I ate my second dinner when 2 hikers I knew arrive to join me. Crunchmaster and Stone set off before me from Ziggys&rsquo; place but were behind me till now. They told of their 30+ mile day. Ouch. I met a total of 7 hikers today, one of which was on his last day. He was ending his journey prematurely. This is one tough hike.</p>
