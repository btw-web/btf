<h1>The Warning</h1>

<p>A local guy joined me in a restaurant in the town of Guachochi. I was enjoying my favourite Mexican meal of Huevos Rancheros. &lsquo;<em>Did you know there is a curfew in town</em>&lsquo;, he said. &lsquo;<em>No</em>&lsquo;, I replied, &lsquo;<em>Is it enforced by the Police or the Military</em>&lsquo;. What he said next had me questioning my safety. &lsquo;<em>Neither, it&rsquo;s enforced by the drug cartels. 5pm everybody should be off the streets</em>&lsquo;. </p>



<p>Only a week earlier there had been some trouble which resulted in the shooting death of one of the military. There was a lot of tension in town. This local was genuinely concerned for my welfare. I told him how I camp off the road, out of sight if possible. He agreed that was a good idea.</p>



<p>We spoke a little further about the trouble and living in this part of the world. &lsquo;<em>Things have been quiet here since about September or so last year</em>&lsquo;, he said. &lsquo;<em>But what can you do. Life goes on. We work, we feed our families</em>. <em>Tourists are not the target</em>. <em>You would have to do something really dumb like steal from a plantation to be targeted</em>&lsquo;. Despite tourists not being targeted I wanted to leave this town.</p>



<p>It was a shame that the local tourism industry in this part of the world no longer exists. When I rode into town the large main hotel appeared empty. I also wondered why there was so little traffic on the road in recent days. A google search confirmed the problems in the town. It also revealed that while I was spending my last night in the town of Creel there was a Gang related shooting. This stuff is real. I&rsquo;m getting out of here.</p>



<p>It was mid afternoon when I finished lunch and hit the road. I cycled as far away from the canyonlands as I could in the couple of hours before the &lsquo;5pm&rsquo; curfew. It was a shame, I wanted to visit the nearby Sinforosa Canyon. </p>



<p>I pulled far off the road on some trails used by the locals as they walk between villages. There was a lack of large trees for shelter but lots of semi desert vegetation to shelter me from sight. The weather forecast promised a very cold night and my campsite was at 2500m and cold it was.</p>



<p>I woke before the sun had a chance to warm my tent. I was too cold to sleep. My sleeping bag is rated to -7C (20F) but it was dirty and lacking a bit of that nice warm loft. When the sun rose my thermometer showed a chilly -6C. </p>



<p>My water bottles were frozen and there was a layer of ice on the inside of my tent. Suffice to say it took a while for me to warm up and get on the road. When I did it was cold. It was cold for most of the day. It wasn&rsquo;t until I started to decrease altitude that it warmed a little. The scenery varied from rather average pine forest or semi desert scrublands at the high altitudes and dry farmlands at the lower altitudes. I spent the night sleeping in a farmers field out of sight of the road.</p>



<p>I made good time in the morning to make it into the town of Hidalgo Del Parral. I treated myself to a more flash hotel than I would normally spend money on. For two days I planned routes further south and gorged myself.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Near Guachochi to a Farmers Field = 101km</strong></li><li><strong>Farmers Field to Hidalgo Del Parral = 56km</strong></li></ul>
