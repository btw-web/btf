<h1>PCT Day 126 Entering Washington</h1>

<p><strong>21st August 2015</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mileage 25.1</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cascade Locks (2155.1) to Dirt Road Camp (2180.2)</strong></p>



<p>This is the most rested I&rsquo;d been since I started the trip, I thought to myself as I walked across The Bridge of the Gods. I crossed the Columbia river into Washington. The steel mesh bridge let me peer down to the water below.</p>



<p>Not a crossing for the hikers who fear such sights. There is no pedestrian lane so I hiked with the vehicles. Only one redneck took offence to my presence, I know this because he pointed to the sky with his middle finger. Welcome to Washington.</p>



<p>I was carrying enough food to last me for 148 miles or 238km. But the heavy weight of the food and extra clothing for the potential cold of Washington didn&rsquo;t feel as bad as it normally does leaving a town. There was a bounce in my step. I had excessive amounts of energy. </p>



<p>My days rest in Cascade Locks had been all that I wanted and needed. Lots of sleep and good food. I realised I had not had a days rest from hiking since Etna in California, 548.7 miles ago. That&rsquo;s 883 kilometres without a rest. No wonder I&rsquo;m tired!</p>



<p>I also hit the trail excited that I would see my Canadian friend Sally. It seems I may have inspired her to hike the PCT in 2016. She&rsquo;s taken some time off work to hike part of Washington. She is heading southbound on the same section that I am heading northbound, so we will pass each other somewhere. Both Sally and her partner Paul will &nbsp;pick me up from Manning Park (if I can make it) and give me a place to rest after the trail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Washington section of the trail is already noticeably different from Oregon. For example, I&rsquo;m sitting in my tent typing up this blog with clean feet. None of the loose volcanic dusty soil here that covers the legs and feet with a thick layer of grime. </p>



<p>But that will likely change. For today at least there was lots of loamy soil or rocks. Also the trail wanted to go either up or down. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to like flat very much. It&rsquo;s also cooler, noticeably so. There&rsquo;s lots of trees and undergrowth but also lots of logging. </p>



<p>In fact the whole section of the trail has been logged at least once but mostly several times in the past. Some sections of the trail passed clear cut forests, but I&rsquo;m sure it will be replanted next year and 20 years from now most people wouldn&rsquo;t know the difference.</p>



<p>The day seemed to get away from me. It was late in the evening when I started to look around for a place to camp. There was no flat ground till I hit an old logging road. It didn&rsquo;t look like it had been used for a while. It also looked like other hikers had camped there at some time. </p>



<p>The campfire ring and wrappers of pasta packets in the bushes gave it away. My pasta with lemon flavoured Salmon and an Avocado tasted particularly special tonight.</p>
