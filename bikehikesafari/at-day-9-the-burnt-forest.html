<h1>AT Day 9 &#8211; The burnt forest</h1>

<h1>The Burnt Forest</h1>



<p><strong>24th April 2017</strong></p>



<p><strong><span id="selectionBoundary_1493077785318_5542595239443215" class="rangySelectionBoundary" style="line-height: 0; display: none;"></span>20.1 miles</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bushcamp (115.9) to Rufus Morgan Shelter (136)</strong></p>



<p>The intense rain of yesterday had all but disappeared. I was woken by the calls of birds and the few stray drops of water from the trees above. Thick cloud enveloped the area and made the cool air even cooler.</p>



<p><span id="selectionBoundary_1493077714778_3035773609946456" class="rangySelectionBoundary" style="line-height: 0; display: none;"></span>I had a small climb up to the top of Wayah Bald. As I climbed I passed a wayward camper just rousing for the morning, then another and yet more. People were camping on whatever flat dry piece of land they could find, much as I had done the evening before. I think last night was a hard night fir some hikers.</p>



<p>I reached Wayah Bald just as the clouds parted for a few seconds to reveal a lovely view of green forest and silvery grey clouds. I cooked up a second breakfast in the hope that the view would return. It did not. Wayah Bald is a corruption of the Cherokee name for wolf, Wa-Ya. Red Wolves were once common in this area, but are no longer found in the area.</p>



<p>I descended past a shelter that still had many hikers drying out their gear as witnessed by the multicoloured fly sheets on any tree branch that would hold them. I bumped into a group of 5 hikers I&rsquo;d met about 4 days ago. I was traveling much faster than them so I had to ask how they got ahead. They skipped a section due to an injury one of them sustained. There are so many hikers on this trail getting injured. The constant climbing and descending is taking its toll.</p>



<p>There were a lot of fire scared sections of trail today. Most of which looked very recent. I&rsquo;m not sure how long the forest starts to regenerate in this part of the world, is it a year or ten years. Either way I don&rsquo;t think fire is very common in this part of the world.</p>



<p>I cruised down the long downhill to Rufus Morgan Shelter. There were only 5 other hikers staying here which was surprising, I expected the usual 20 plus. With a couple of hours of sunlight left we all chatted about the trail and our hopes of finishing. I&rsquo;m really in a good place right now. My body feels strong, I&rsquo;m motivated to be out on the trail in all weather and I&rsquo;m enjoying meeting other hikers, even if I&rsquo;m moving faster than them and won&rsquo;t see them again. All the talk around camp is about the big climb tomorrow, it&rsquo;s one of the biggest on the whole Appalachian Trail at around 8 miles long and just over 3000 vertical feet. Until tomorrow.</p>
