<h1>Bicycle Touring Freycinet National Park</h1>

<p>Most people who visit Tasmania end up at Freycinet National Park. Most only stay a matter of minutes, some for days. For me it was a short bicycle touring and hiking visit, this time.</p>



<p>My departure from <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/biking-and-hiking-maria-island/">Maria Island</a></strong> under dark storm clouds resulted in my bike being coated with salt spray from the ferry crossing back to the mainland. So once I hit the mainland I doused my bike with fresh water to rinse the corrosive salt from my bike. </p>



<p>I was faced with cycling in the rain, something that I must admit that I do not overly enjoy, however, on this particular day I was cycling in the rain with a 30km/h tailwind.</p>



<p>Now any cyclist will admit that the wind is both their best friend and most bitter of enemies. Today we were best of friends. I don&rsquo;t think I have ever covered ground so quick and effortlessly, I was cycling with a big smile on my face. I&rsquo;m sure people looking at me must have thought why is he smiling while cycling in the rain, is there something wrong with him. Well, its not everyday that I manage to ride my loaded touring bike at 30km/h on average along the highway.</p>



<p>In short time I made to my planed free camp for then night at the roadside stop on Mayfield Bay which is about halfway between <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/biking-and-hiking-maria-island/"><strong>Maria Island</strong></a> and Freycinet National Park. Due to the wind I contemplated cycling all the way to Freycinet but choose the comfort of a cup of tea by the beach in the rain instead.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Freycinet National Park</strong></h2>



<p>The following day I made short work of the trip to Freycinet National Park. The National Park campground is right on the beach. I found that the picnic BBQ area also has a power socket. I charged some electrical stuff while cooking on the free electric BBQ and drinking from my favourite red wine cask.</p>



<p>Later, I took the short walk to the <a href="https://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=3363" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Wineglass Bay lookout area</strong></a> but decided against any long hikes. I just didn&rsquo;t really feel like hiking today. In a couple of weeks time I will be<a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/winter-hiking-the-walls-of-jerusalem-national-park-tasmania/"> <strong>hiking in the Walls of Jerusalem National Park</strong></a> so decided I&rsquo;ll wait till then to expend my hiking energy. After the hike I bumped into a work colleague from Darwin, small world. Also here after cycling from Sydney.</p>

<p>It was a slow morning for my planned departure. I cycled to out Cape Tourville in the morning for a look. I was somewhat surprised to be greeted by a 22% grade hill. That was a tough climb and my bike had no panniers. At the Cape I could hear Seals but couldn&rsquo;t see them. I cycled around the hiking track that looped around the Lighthouse and headed back to the National Parks campground on the beach to pack up and move north.</p>



<h2><strong>Friendly Beach</strong></h2>



<p>It was about 1pm when I cycled into Friendly beach. It was a side trip off the main road to / from Freycinet. The road was corrugated. This caused my 2 front water bottle holders to simultaneously break. Both the plastic bottom mounts, snap. So I need to buy new water bottle holders in Launceston. While at Friendly beach I had a late lunch when a friendly Echidna decided to feast on ants next to my lunch spot. Lovin my Echidna experiences in Tassie. Does anybody know the name of a baby Echidna?</p>

<p>From friendly beach I cruised to Bicheno and onto Douglas Apsley National Park. From there I rode on the hiking trail to the free campsite about 250m from the carpark.</p>



<p>So, north I keep heading, for now.</p>
