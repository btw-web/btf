<h1>CDT Day 68 I just hiked 1000 miles but I&#8217;m still in pain</h1>

<p><strong>24th June</strong></p>



<p><strong>19.7 miles</strong></p>



<p><strong>Twin Lakes (983.6) to Busk Creek (1003.3)</strong></p>



<p>I woke feeling well rested. My stomach was sore. It felt like I had a procession of razor blades in there somewhere. And just for something different my lower abdomen was very tender. Strangely, my energy levels felt great.</p>



<p>After yet another forced breakfast of granola, fruit, yogurt and coffee I made a decision to try and hike. Prior to making the decision I consulted the maps. There were many trailheads, roads and highways on this next section. I concluded that if I start to feel like I should get off trail then there would be many, many options to do so.</p>



<p>I set off hiking. My energy felt fine but my stomach was still sore. I was able to hike at a much better pace than recent days and weeks. But something just didn&rsquo;t feel right. I&rsquo;m hoping it was just the Giardia medication killing the bugs, I&rsquo;ve had this kind of reaction before.</p>



<p>Thoughts of what to do were running through my head. I received so many private messages from friends, messages on Facebook and messages through this blog. I&rsquo;m overwhelmed that so many people are thinking of me and offering assistance. I am deeply humbled. Thank you to all.</p>



<p>Late in the afternoon things weren&rsquo;t getting any better. I still wasn&rsquo;t comfortable. I made a decision to get off trail and get things checked out. As it&rsquo;s Friday today I&rsquo;ll try and see if my body will allow me to continue until Monday. A dear special friend will come and pick me up. I&rsquo;ll get some checks and see what the Doctors say.</p>



<p>As for the trail, it was amazing. It was actually a trail. This is a very well hiked area. The highest mountain in Colorado is here, Mt Elbert. As are many other 14000 plus feet mountains. It made for gentle grades and easy miles. I guess I needed that right now.</p>



<p>I hiked with several other hikers. Big John is still with me. Boston joined me, I hadn&rsquo;t seen him since part way through New Mexico. And I was joined by Zorro. I first met Zorro on the Amtrak train to the start of the hike. I met him a couple of times early on in New Mexico but haven&rsquo;t seen him for maybe 800 miles. Talking of miles, I just hiked over 1000 miles today. Yay for me.</p>
