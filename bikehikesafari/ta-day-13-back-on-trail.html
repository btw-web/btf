<h1>TA Day 13 &#8211; Back on Trail</h1>

<p>5th November</p>



<p>25.7km</p>



<p>Kerikeri 227.3km to Pahia 253km</p>



<p>I was keen to leave, despite a deep cough that still lingered. I was certain I was over the worst of it. I felt a little like a caged lion. Energy, I had loads of it and longed to be moving again. A Google search was enough to tell that I didn&rsquo;t have pneumonia, which was my initial fear. My chat with the pharmacist confirmed that while it was possible it was unlikely.</p>



<p>There were as many 8 other hikers on trail today, all leaving at different time. I had to post my bounce box to Auckland. It&rsquo;s crazy to think I&rsquo;ll be there in about 2 weeks.</p>



<p>It was just before 10am when I made my way out if town, stopping briefly at the oldest building in all of Newlll and Zealand. Built in 1831-32, it doesn&rsquo;t really compare to places in Europe, Asia or Africa.</p>

<p>I had lots of thoughts today. Partly because I was very ill when I was there in 2009. I contracted Maleria in Cameroon but it was a visit I made to Timbuktu in Mali, many years ago that occupied my mind. I often get random flashbacks to previous travel destinations. All the memories are as vivid as if they happened yesterday.</p>



<p>A sand storm blew in while in the Sahara just outside of Timbuktu. Bit annoying for us but not a problem for our camels but it was an experience. I think my camel was called Ahmed. The 1000 year old history of the old salt trading caravans traveling the Sahara. I was reminded of a book I read many years ago by <a href="https://amzn.to/2SJrFWx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Ibn Battuta</strong>,</a> the Middle Eastern Marco Polo. Anyway, I digress. Back to the trail.</p>



<p>The trail was mostly on forestry plantation roads and rather peaceful. I kept a keen eye out for the native bird, the Kiwi, but nothing. I hope to see one of these elusive creatures before I finish the trail.</p>



<p>My energy level stayed high but I rested often to be sure. I was still coughing but had no problem breathing while hiking up hills. I&rsquo;m not 100% but I think I&rsquo;ll be fine in a coup e of more days.</p>



<p>After a pleasant day hiking through forests I arrived at the pricey holiday town of Pahia in the Bay if Islands. Nearby is Waitangi a nationally significant place as a treaty was signed between the Maori and British. The first time a colonial world power recognized indigenous ownership of land and culture. The <strong><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">treaty of Waitangi</a></strong> is an important document for New Zealand and the world.</p>
