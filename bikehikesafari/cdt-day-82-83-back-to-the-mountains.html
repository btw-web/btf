<h1>CDT Day 82-83 Back to the Mountains </h1>

<p><strong>8-9 July</strong></p>



<p><strong>18 miles</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grand Lake (1194.9) to Never Summer Wilderness (1212.9)</strong></p>



<p>I had all the best intentions of taking a leisurely day hike in the nearby Rocky Mountain National Park. The US postal service had other plans for me. Leki kindly sent me a replacement pole for the one I broke several days earlier. But the postal service hadn&rsquo;t sorted their mail in the morning. So I took the day off and relaxed in the town of Grand Lake. The pole was waiting for me in the afternoon, thank you Leki.</p>



<p>Lucky and I had no intention of leaving town early. An all you can eat buffet breakfast followed by an early lunch had me sufficiently loaded with calories. We navigated a road walk out of town followed by some back trails that slowly had &nbsp;had us climbing. The views were limited by the tree cover until we hiked above 11000ft. The views opened up as the air got thinner.</p>



<p>By 6pm we started to plan where we might camp. Hopefully near water. But I started feeling sick. I was ready to vomit. My hands started shaking. I&rsquo;ve felt like this many times in the past and knew exactly what was going on. I had depleted all the stores of energy from my body. I completely bonked. &nbsp;Having eaten so much before leaving town I wasn&rsquo;t hungry while hiking. I stopped, forced some chocolate in my mouth, drank some water and waited to feel fine. Twenty minutes later I was full of energy and heading down to camp.</p>



<p>We reached camp around 7pm. I got a fire going and Lucky cooked us some Hot Dogs for dinner. We planned a luxury campfire meal for our first night. I felt so much better after eating 3 Hot Dogs covered in tomato sauce (ketchup) and mustard.</p>



<p>We looked at our maps and were surprised to find we had hiked 18 miles during the afternoon. That&rsquo;s a lot more than we thought we might do. I guess if we keep it up we&rsquo;ll be in Wyoming sooner than we think.</p>
