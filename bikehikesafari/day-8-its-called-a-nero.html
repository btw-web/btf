<h1>Day 8 It&#8217;s called a Nero</h1>

<p><strong>24th April 2015</strong></p>



<p><strong>8.9 miles</strong></p>



<p><strong>Warner Springs (109.5) to Bushcamp (118.4)</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nero Day</strong></p>



<p>Apparently when I spend the majority of the day in a town or otherwise chilling out and only complete less than 10 miles in a day it&rsquo;s called a &lsquo;<strong>Nero Day</strong>&lsquo;. Before doing this thru hiking thingy, 10 miles was considered a decent days worth of hiking. Well, not anymore, apparently.</p>



<p>I was stuck in Warner Springs waiting for a package to be delivered to the post office. I got a message advising me it would be late. Well, it wasn&rsquo;t late it was very late. Actually it didn&rsquo;t arrive. Maybe it will arrive next week I am told. Despite enjoying my time in Warner Springs I felt more than ready to move on. So minus the package I set off. Not without catching up with Andy, The Sheriff, and all round good guy.</p>



<p>When time permits he comes to the Resource Centre to meet the hikers, give lifts to the post office and help out if possible. On more than one occasion I heard hikers say that they wished their local Police was like him. I guess you can&rsquo;t put a price on positive community engagement.</p>



<p>It was 2.30pm when I hit the trail. A lot of hikers were hitch hiking back to near the start of the trail, Lake Morena, for the Kick Off Party. A bit of a gathering of past and current hikers. </p>



<p>Part of me thought it would be cool to hang out there. They have lectures on all things hiking, but really I don&rsquo;t feel a need to be together with such a large group of people.</p>



<p>So instead I&rsquo;m hiking uphill to the clouds in light drizzle on the kind of day where everything is 50 shades of grey. But it&rsquo;s great to be on the trail. </p>



<p>And thanks to the hikers ahead of me who left maybe $60 worth of freeze dried meals in the free food/hiker box. The double serving of shepherds pie was quite nice tonight. The fruit granola that I will have for breakfast tomorrow was donated by a fellow blogger,<a href="https://hikingthepainaway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">&nbsp;<strong>https://hikingthepainaway.com</strong></a>. I owe you a beer!</p>



<p>Oh, and hello to Neil&rsquo;s (aka Hendriks) parents who might be reading this, he is doing well! I appreciate that some people reading this have friends or family on the trail and want to know what it&rsquo;s like, enjoy.</p>



<p>Oh, in case you were wondering what was in the package that I was waiting for, but didn&rsquo;t receive, Rain Pants. I&rsquo;m expecting rain and winds up to 65 miles per hour in the next day or so, wish me luck!</p>
