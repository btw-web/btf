<h1>AT Day 47-48 Wildlife and a Wild Life</h1>

<p>1-2 June</p>



<p>26.2 miles</p>



<p>Harper Creek (835.7) to Rockfish Gap/Waynesboro (861.9)</p>



<p>I&rsquo;ve been pleasantly surprised by the views on the Appalachian Trail. The views have to be earned. The constant ups and downs on this trail are no joke, even for a guy like me with a few trail miles under his belt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The early morning started with a climb to the top of yet another mountain. I was consoled by the regular rocky outcrops with expansive views. On one side of the ridge I could see the flat farmland, the other side had rolling hills.</p>



<p>Either there seemed to be a lot of easy flat trail today or my light backpack had me racing along the trail. On three occasions I nearly stood on a snake. Twice I noticed frogs on the trail. While filling up my water bottle I saw a small salamander in a small spring. And I was a couple of minutes late on seeing a black bear on the trail. There&rsquo;s animals out here, specially when the weather warms up.</p>



<p>By late afternoon I arrived at Rockfish Gap. It&rsquo;s the stepping off point for the town of Waynesboro, often called the friendliest town on the Appalachian Trail. It was off to a good start. At the trailhead there was a note with telephone numbers of local trail angels who offered free lifts to hikers. I arrived with two other hikers. Sara and Steve, the local trail angels, gave us a lift to town.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I checked into a hotel and washed my clothes in the bathtub. I was in the bathtub at the same time. By the time I was finished the water was chocolate brown in colour. I showered myself and my clothes clean. There was no laundry on site so I had to adapt. Most people can&rsquo;t believe just how dirty Borg myself and my clothes can get while hiking.</p>



<p>My clothes were dry and smelling clean in the morning but I was not ready to get back into the trail. I picked up my bounce box from the post office and spent a couple of hours getting some personal things done. This left me tired. Before the post office closed I headed back to the post office to send my bounce box to myself further up the trail. It was late in the day. I wasn&rsquo;t getting back on trail today. I took a zero day and relaxed for the evening.</p>



<p>I added about 1kg (2lb) or unneeded gear from my backpack to my bounce box. No need for rain pants, thermal top or bottom, extra socks and more. I cut some items out of my first aid kit and more. </p>



<p><strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/lightweight-hiking-gear-list/">The base weight of my backpack is now under 6kg (13lb)</a></strong>. And I&rsquo;m making a plan to get rid of my stove next week. I&rsquo;ll be going &lsquo;stove less&rsquo;, eating only meals that require no cooking. More on that later. Suffice to say I might have a 5.5kg (12lb) pack soon. It could be said that I&rsquo;m almost ready to make the leap from lightweight hiker to ultra light hiker, I just can&rsquo;t get rid of my camera gear.</p>
