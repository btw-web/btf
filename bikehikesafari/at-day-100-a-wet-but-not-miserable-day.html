<h1>AT Day 100 &#8211; A wet but not miserable day</h1>

<p><strong>24th July</strong></p>



<p><strong>20.4 miles&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Killington (1704.1) to Hwy 12 Earlybird&rsquo;s House (1724.5)</strong></p>



<p>I stepped out the front door of the hotel to dark grey clouds and imminent rain. Just after 6am I started hiking and by around 6.30 I had my rain gear on. Not only was it raining but it was cold. It seemed like only a week ago I was suffering in the heat and humidity. The northern states have a reputation for early cold weather, sometimes there isn&rsquo;t much of a summer.</p>



<p>Rolling hills and slippery trails summed up the days hike. I stopped at the first shelter to grab a quick snack and water. It was around 9am and it had several hikers wrapped in sleeping bags, they weren&rsquo;t in a hurry to move.</p>



<p>I continued on the sometimes steep trail, including one ladder that I had to use to get down a cliff. I was making good time in the rain. I was hoping to hike the 20 miles from Killington to highway 12 to meet up with Earlybird, a thru hiker I met on the CDT last year. She kindly offered to host me for the night.</p>



<p>I was making good time had time so I made a small detour to a private shelter called The Lookout. It&rsquo;s more luxurious than normal AT shelters, it has a fireplace and 4 walls instead of 3. That&rsquo;s luxury. When I arrived there were about 8 hikers laying on their mats and wrapped up in their sleeping bags. They hadn&rsquo;t moved all day. It was just after midday.</p>



<p>I lingered and chatted to the other hikers, none of which I&rsquo;d ever met before. It was around 2pm when I took my first steps outside the shelter. My steps were slow and deliberate. I was cold. My whole body started to shiver and I started to feel a little bit uncoordinated as I walked. I tried to walk as fast as I dared and tensed my upper body to try and generate body heat. It worked but it took around 15 minutes to warm up. It was a further hour before my body was comfortably warm.</p>



<p>There had been a cold soaking rain all day. I use a waterproof case to store my phone. To use it I needed a dry bit of tissue to dry the screen and my fingers, the phone wouldn&rsquo;t work if I didn&rsquo;t do this. I used lots of toilet tissue today.</p>



<p>Just before 4.30pm I arrived at the trailhead and parking area on highway 12. My body was soaked to the bone. I waited less than a minute until Earlybird arrived and whisked me off to her home in the middle of nowhere only a couple of miles from the trail.</p>
