<h1>CDT Day 162 A Perfect Day</h1>

<p><strong>27th September</strong></p>



<p><strong>15.5 miles</strong></p>



<p><strong>Reynolds campground (2623.5) to Many Glacier (2639)</strong></p>



<p>It was warm last night. For the first time in many nights we were not wrapped up in sleeping bags like butterflies in cocoons. And the warmth stayed with us for the rest of the day. The skies were blue and the wind was slight. It was a good day to be hiking.</p>



<p>We had a problem. We were a bit low on food. With all the restaurants closed we had to come up with more creative ways to increase our larder of food. Only a mile from camp some day hikers asked us about our trip, we received fruit in return.</p>



<p>The hike to the top of Piegan Pass came quickly. On route we came upon a flock of Bighorn Sheep. They grazed near the top of the pass as we hiked by. I think they are the least common of the grazing animals in the lower 48.</p>



<p>Piegan Pass did not disappoint. Distant glacial mountains in one direction, jagged peaks peaks in the other and a narrow hiking trail that is the CDT. No photo could capture the beauty of the area. In fact the whole of Glacier National Park has exceeded my expectation.</p>



<p>On the decent to the park village of Many Glacier there was a lot of bear activity, scat and prints. We ran into a southbound hiker, Smiley. He has been hiking the CDT northbound but flipped up to Canada to walk southbound. Last week he was mauled by a grizzly in the Wind River Range, Wyoming. He bore large tooth marks on his butt. He described a look of anger that the grizzly had in its eyes. Bubbles and I saw his puncture wounds. They were nasty. He is lucky and grateful that he is still able to hike. That was two CDT thru hikers that have been mauled in the area between Wind River Range and Yellowstone National Park. Future hikers take note, be careful in that area.</p>



<p>We staggered into the campground at Many Glacier. Not before we walked past the closed Many Glacier hotel. Bubbles told me to wait while she entered the closed hotel. She walked out a minute later with a cheeseburger. Workers renovating the hotel felt sorry that the restaurant was closed.</p>



<p>We walked into the campground and several campers gave us fruit and other meals. We now had plenty of food. The kindness of strangers is alive and well.</p>
