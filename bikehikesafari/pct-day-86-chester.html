<h1>PCT Day 86 Chester</h1>

<p><strong>Mileage 12.9</strong></p>



<p><strong>Soldier Creek (1331.9) to Feather River (1344.8)</strong></p>



<p><strong>11th June 2015</strong></p>



<p>I could almost smell the bacon and eggs in the morning air. I was only about 3 miles from a highway that could make the dream a reality. I hadn&rsquo;t really planned to go there. </p>



<p>A combination of timing my arrival further down the trail with my parcel deliveries (camera and trekking poles) and a text message from Teflon saying she would be there sealed the deal. I was heading to the town of Chester.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a short hitch hike into the compact town. Luckily a fellow hiker, Tapatio was there to give me a lift in a borrowed car. Bacon and eggs were a reality. While finishing my meal and coffee I received another text from Teflon. </p>



<p>The text said she was in the same cafe as me ordering breakfast. I exited my secluded booth and peeked around the corner. Hey Teflon. Reunited.</p>



<p>Next business of the day was showers, laundry and charging my electrical stuff. Across the street we go with Recon, another hiker. </p>



<p>We showered and put the laundry on. While waiting for the laundry we had lunch. We are all getting skinny and need to fatten up so a plate of salad followed by Ribs and Sweet potato fries are ordered. Oh and I also tried the local beer, it&rsquo;s no Alaska Pale Ale but it&rsquo;s ok.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our return to the laundromat was a moment of dread. Our clothes were gone. We placed them in the dryer. Gone. Gone. Gone. </p>



<p>I&rsquo;m standing in the laundromat wearing rain pants, rain jacket and boots with no socks. That&rsquo;s it. All my other clothing were in the dryer. I was partially angry, partially helpless. </p>



<p>For 15 minutes we discussed options. Just when it was time to report the theft a car pulled up and a lady jumped out with our clothes. The unobservant husband grabbed our hiking clothes out of the dryer instead of his wife&rsquo;s sleeping garments that were in another dryer! No need to say anything more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Showered, fed and wearing my clean clothes I hitch hiked back to the trail with Teflon. But I needed a monster sized thick shake first. We hiked about 9 miles into the evening till we reached the North Fork of the Feather River.</p>



<p>Loads of PCT hikers crowded into the few flat spots available next to the babbling river. Great to catch up with Teflon, the others aren&rsquo;t far behind.&nbsp;</p>
