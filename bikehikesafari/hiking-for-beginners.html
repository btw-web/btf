<p>If you want the simple definition, then hiking is when you take long walks over trails, on unmarked land, or cross country. This description is rather vague and might lead you to wonder what the point is.</p>



<p>In reality, hiking is when you take long-distance walks around breathtaking scenery or through isolated locations. Sometimes these hikes are intense and require practice runs before compilation, and others are more relaxing and slow-paced as you enjoy the natural world around you.</p>



<p>In general, you might expect to break a sweat, but the view and the quiet are why most people hike.</p>



<p>Normally, you can expect your trip to last for half a day, but sometimes people will hike for weeks or months on an expedition of a lifetime. These longer trips allow you to take in the wilderness at a slow pace, to explore cultures and towns as you make pit stops on the way, and reconnect to the enjoyment of discovery. These overnight or longer trip are covered on more detail in the <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/backpacking-for-beginners/">Backpacking for Beginners Guide</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Hiking is a form of exercise, and if you take a half-day slow walk or a month-long mountain climb, you will feel your body stretch its limbs and earn its food.</p>



<p>You might think that jogging, running, cycling, or other exercise enjoy the same scenic pleasure, but in reality, they cannot appreciate their surroundings in the same way. Moving fast defeats the object of a hike.</p>



<h2 id="the-benefits-of-hiking"><span id="The_Benefits_Of_Hiking"><strong>The Benefits Of Hiking</strong></span></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="1000" height="401" src="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Benefits-Of-Hiking.jpg" alt="The Benefits Of Hiking" class="wp-image-23157" srcset="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Benefits-Of-Hiking.jpg 1000w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Benefits-Of-Hiking-300x120.jpg 300w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Benefits-Of-Hiking-770x309.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-pin-media="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Benefits-Of-Hiking.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>Hiking has a lot of benefits, including reducing your body fat, strengthening your muscles, keeping your brain active, and improving mental health.&nbsp; Sometimes being outdoors is all you need to improve your quality of life.</p>



<h3 id="keeps-your-brain-active"><span id="Keeps_Your_Brain_Active"><strong>Keeps Your Brain Active</strong></span></h3>



<p>Hiking forces you to move around and look at your surroundings. These new images in your mind keep the brain active as it digests the new data and stores it. The simple act of seeing something new is enough to engage your thinking.</p>



<p>However, looking at a map and comparing the information to the landscape around you is another way in which your brain&rsquo;s health will improve. As you move around, your brain will map the location it is walking through to help you return later. It will catalog the data and predict your next move so you don&rsquo;t get lost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this new information helps to <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/strayer-nyt.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>keep your brain active and sharp</strong></a>!</p>



<h3 id="reducing-anxiety"><span id="Reducing_Anxiety"><strong>Reducing Anxiety</strong></span></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0033350606001466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Research has proven time and time again</strong></a> that being in the wilderness is a fantastic way to reduce stress and anxiety. The therapeutic release of endorphins, after walking around greenery and through natural landscapes, can reduce the risk of depression by almost 20%. These results are only true when you don&rsquo;t encounter dangers on your hike. As long as you follow the advice below, you will be happy, healthy, and stress-free because of your walk!</p>



<h3 id="reducing-body-fat"><span id="Reducing_Body_Fat"><strong>Reducing Body Fat</strong></span></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/hiking-calories-burned#bottom-line" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Hiking can help you lose weight</strong> </a>due to the slow-releasing calories you will burn throughout the day. If you were to run or participate in an activity that requires fast-releasing energy, you would burn through the calories you have recently digested. However, if you are on a slow-moving activity, where you don&rsquo;t need a quick release, then your body will burn your body fat which has pocketed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This way, you will lose fat on your body and not just burn through your morning breakfast.</p>



<p>I can attest to this being true. When I thru-hiked the <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/hiking-the-pacific-crest-trail/">Pacific Crest Trail</a></strong> I lost 33lb / 15kg over 5 months of hiking.</p>



<h3 id="reducing-the-risk-of-disease"><span id="Reducing_The_Risk_of_Disease"><strong>Reducing The Risk of Disease</strong></span></h3>



<p>All types of exercises are great at reducing the risk of disease due to their weight loss abilities and due to <strong><a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/physical-activity-and-cancer/what-are-the-benefits-of-exercise?_ga=2.179547172.128932891.1546599670-1304503403.1546599670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the reduction in hormone levels</a>. </strong>For example, cancer researchers found that exercising caused the hormone estrogen to move around the body less. This hormone normally sends messages to the body asking for more production. If the cells are told to do this action too often, they will divide too much and grow out of control. This is the main factor in cancer.</p>



<p>Exercising levels the body and redirects your hormones to their appropriate needs, like switching a computer off and on again.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="strengthening-your-bones"><span id="Strengthening_Your_Bones"><strong>Strengthening Your Bones</strong></span></h3>



<p>Because hiking is a low-impact exercise, your joints and bones will not be harmed or overworked on the journey. Your bones will naturally become weaker as you age, which is why low-impact activities throughout your life can keep you strong. If you start off with strong bones, the deterioration won&rsquo;t affect you too much, and if you notice a decrease in bone strength, starting hiking will strengthen the bone density you have left.</p>



<p>Being outdoors will also increase your vitamin D intake, which means that your body will get the nutrients it needs just by being in the sun.</p>



<h3 id="toning-your-muscles"><span id="Toning_Your_Muscles"><strong>Toning Your Muscles</strong></span></h3>



<p>Although hiking is a low-impact activity, the long day&rsquo;s walk will slowly build on your muscles. Specifically, your calves, quadriceps, and hamstrings muscles (all of which are around your legs) will constantly be moving and working throughout the day. This will give your legs an improved definition!&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="the-types-of-hiking"><span id="The_Types_Of_Hiking"><strong>The Types Of Hiking</strong></span></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="1000" height="401" src="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Types-Of-Hiking.jpg" alt="The Types Of Hiking" class="wp-image-23158" srcset="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Types-Of-Hiking.jpg 1000w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Types-Of-Hiking-300x120.jpg 300w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Types-Of-Hiking-770x309.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-pin-media="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Types-Of-Hiking.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>Speaking in general terms, there are three types of hiking. Each consists of at least a couple of hours of walking and can be on a pre-made trail or the open landscape.</p>



<p>It is rare that you&rsquo;ll need to know which is which, but if you are following a new trail and they don&rsquo;t give you a lot of information about the hike, it might be helpful to understand the brief terminology they do provide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because hiking is a casual activity, it&rsquo;s unlikely that you&rsquo;ll find gatekeepers blocking your path and demanding you know which of the three types you are currently on before allowing you to pass, but it can be helpful to understand what kind of snacks you will need, what type of gear you should bring and if you have the time to complete the trail.</p>



<h3 id="1-day-hiking"><span id="1_Day_Hiking">1. <strong>Day Hiking</strong></span></h3>



<p>As the name suggests, day hiking is a trip that doesn&rsquo;t last longer than a day and doesn&rsquo;t venture into the twilight hours. These walks can last anywhere from an hour to the whole day and can be simple walks through the woods or hiking up mountains.&nbsp;This article is primarily focused on <strong>Day Hiking</strong>.</p>



<p>Some day hikes will come with tours, others with handy maps and coffee shops along the way. The style of terrain for day hiking is vast, as it only refers to the length of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of these trails will end where you started, in a nice circular route, and others will require you to turn around or book a hotel for the night. Whichever path you take, make sure you plan your adventure in advance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Day hiking is perfect for beginners. Start off with a journey that lasts only a couple of hours, so your leg muscles can get used to the workout. As you get stronger, you can go for longer and become more adventurous with your choices.</p>



<h3 id="2-trekking-or-backpacking"><span id="2_Trekking_or_Backpacking">2. <strong>Trekking or Backpacking</strong></span></h3>



<p>Trekking is a hike that lasts multiple days, and you carry your gear with you. You need a tent, all your food, and a map so that you can wild camp along your journey. These types of hikes are popular where wild camping is legal.</p>



<p>These <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/backpacking-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backpacking</a></strong> adventures can last for just one night or for months on end!</p>



<p>People who take on these challenges often have a goal in mind. Maybe they want to make a pilgrimage like someone from their ancestry, maybe they aim to climb all the mountains in their area, perhaps a movie was made nearby, and they want to follow the same trail as the characters. Whatever the reason, the sense of accomplishment when the track is completed is worth more than anything!</p>



<p>These goal-oriented hikes are soul-affirming, as you manage to hike a trail that most couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you start off hiking, these types of adventures will be too difficult, but as you get more confident and knowledgeable, you too can walk through the wilderness.</p>



<h3 id="3-thru-hiking"><span id="3_Thru_Hiking">3. <strong>Thru Hiking</strong></span></h3>



<p>Thru Hiking is a very common American take on the two styles above. <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/thru-hiking/">Thru Hiking</a></strong> is a multi week or multi month hiking trip that requires resupply along the way.</p>



<p>Another word for thru hiking is &ldquo;end to end&rdquo; hiking. You pick your thru hiking trail, plan your route and resupply option and set off on your multi week trip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are hundreds of official hikes like this across the globe, including Camino de Santiago in Spain, the Great Divide Trail in Canada, and The <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/pacific-crest-trail-gear-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Pacific Crest Trail</strong></a> in the United States. These long-established routes will have camping sites, log cabins, and hotels along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Walking through different towns and enjoying the world in the slow lane allows you to notice the small changes along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="how-to-choose-a-beginner-hiking-trail"><span id="How_To_Choose_A_Beginner_Hiking_Trail"><strong>How To Choose A Beginner Hiking Trail</strong></span></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="1001" height="401" src="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/How-To-Choose-A-Beginner-Hiking-Trail.jpg" alt="How To Choose A Beginner Hiking Trail" class="wp-image-23159" srcset="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/How-To-Choose-A-Beginner-Hiking-Trail.jpg 1001w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/How-To-Choose-A-Beginner-Hiking-Trail-300x120.jpg 300w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/How-To-Choose-A-Beginner-Hiking-Trail-770x308.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" data-pin-media="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/How-To-Choose-A-Beginner-Hiking-Trail.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>With technology at our fingertips, you would think a quick internet search should show you the best hiking trail for a beginner, but our search engines have not figured out how to send us this information yet. Instead, you will have to rely on your friends, the online community, and a couple of choice apps.</p>



<h3 id="listen-to-the-community"><span id="Listen_To_The_Community"><strong>Listen To The Community</strong></span></h3>



<p>If you talk to your friends, family, or the online community, you will get reviews from real people and their experiences with the trails. They give you tips that you couldn&rsquo;t tell from a picture. For example, one path might look great on paper but actually has a surprisingly steep incline making it difficult for an experienced hiker, let alone a beginner. Or they could suggest avoiding a location on the weekend because it is always packed.</p>



<p>These local tips can help you navigate the trails around you, and you can ask the questions that matter the most to you.</p>



<h3 id="look-out-for-the-elevation"><span id="Look_Out_For_The_Elevation"><strong>Look Out For The Elevation</strong></span></h3>



<p>If you are given a leaflet about a trail, found it online, or are using an app, check out the elevation of the path before you step out on your journey. The elevation is the measurements of the high points and low points on your route.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a beginner, you will want a route with very little elevation change, so you can have a nice and flat journey. As your body strengthens, you can take on trails with more gradient changes, but for now, you want to have fun and not pick something too strenuous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, go for something that is around 5 miles long, with little to no elevation gain.</p>



<h3 id="look-for-for-the-weather"><span id="Look_For_For_The_Weather"><strong>Look For For The Weather</strong></span></h3>



<p>When you have picked out your route, be sure to check the weather forecast on the day of your hike. New hikers should travel on sunny days with a gentle breeze; that way, you stay warm but won&rsquo;t get heatstroke. Until you are confident and comfortable on the trail you have chosen, you should avoid days with strong winds, heavy rain, and even light snowfall.</p>



<p>If you do go out on a drizzly day, be sure to take a raincoat to keep you dry. If you hike on a sunny day, bring sunscreen and water so you stay protected. We discuss safety gear more below, but the weather should be an indicator of what type of protection you may need.</p>



<h3 id="are-there-warnings-about-the-hike"><span id="Are_There_Warnings_About_The_Hike"><strong>Are There Warnings About The Hike?</strong></span></h3>



<p>Some trails will explicitly say not to travel during the winter. Maybe the area is likely to flood, or perhaps ice gets trapped in the middle of the path. Look at the details around the trail and search for their warnings.</p>



<h3 id="do-you-need-a-permit"><span id="Do_You_Need_A_Permit"><strong>Do You Need A Permit?</strong></span></h3>



<p>Some walking trails are private, protected, or have legislation tied to it. This doesn&rsquo;t mean your hiking dream is over, but you may need to pay for a permit to join in with the landscape. These permits often pay for the upkeep of the natural environment, keeping it safe and clean. In more dangerous locations, these permits are used to help find lost hikers. We advise that you avoid these types of hikes until you learn the basics.</p>



<h3 id="use-a-hiking-app"><span id="Use_A_Hiking_App"><strong>Use A Hiking App</strong></span></h3>



<p>Lastly, a great way to figure out if a trail is good for you is to use a hiking app. There are thousands available, and most of which are free. These apps often have online maps, so you can follow the path if you get lost. They have online communities that can help you decide their difficulty level, and they give you the facts about the elevation, so you don&rsquo;t need to do the math.</p>



<h2 id="how-to-physically-prepare-for-a-hike"><span id="How_To_Physically_Prepare_For_A_Hike"><strong>How To Physically Prepare For A Hike</strong></span></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="1000" height="401" src="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/How-To-Physically-Prepare-For-A-Hike.jpg" alt="How To Physically Prepare For A Hike" class="wp-image-23160" srcset="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/How-To-Physically-Prepare-For-A-Hike.jpg 1000w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/How-To-Physically-Prepare-For-A-Hike-300x120.jpg 300w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/How-To-Physically-Prepare-For-A-Hike-770x309.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-pin-media="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/How-To-Physically-Prepare-For-A-Hike.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>Training for a hike can be a great idea if you plan on pushing yourself further, like climbing a mountain, or if you&rsquo;re new to exercise in general and don&rsquo;t want to be worn out before you start.</p>



<h3 id="walking"><span id="Walking"><strong>Walking</strong></span></h3>



<p>Cardio is an important workout for endurance-based exercise. Because hikes last for hours at least, you may want to start off your training by walking more than you&rsquo;re used to.</p>



<p>Add half an hour or more to your daily walking habits, and increase the number until you think you can match your hiking time. Be sure to mix in different elevations, so your calves get the workout they need too. The natural world will not be as flat as your treadmill, so add gradient shifts to make the training more realistic.</p>



<h3 id="work-on-your-core"><span id="Work_On_Your_Core"><strong>Work On Your Core</strong></span></h3>



<p>Although your legs will get the biggest workout on a hike, you cannot ignore your core! Many new hikers forget that you need your core to pull yourself up hills and balance your backpack. We suggest taking a backpack on your walks to adjust your body&rsquo;s expectations.</p>



<p>Also, try doing some crunch workouts in the gym or by following a Youtube channel. We expect your first couple of hikes will be a little tame, so you probably don&rsquo;t need to struggle too hard in this department, but remember that no core workout at all will likely leave you wanting to turn back and go home.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="stretch"><span id="Stretchnbsp"><strong>Stretch&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>



<p>Hiking is a workout on its own, and just like any exercise, you will need to stretch your muscles so they can recover afterward. You will need to stretch your whole body as every muscle will be used on your hike. You can find 20 minute stretching videos on Youtube if you&rsquo;re struggling for inspiration.</p>



<h3 id="walk-easier-hikes"><span id="Walk_Easier_Hikes"><strong>Walk Easier Hikes</strong></span></h3>



<p>If you are planning on tackling a strenuous hike and want to make sure you can reach the top without your body demanding you turn back, then practice on the weeks leading up to the adventure by walking easier hikes.</p>



<p>Doing small hikes often will give your body the workout it needs to prepare for more challenging locations!</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="1001" height="401" src="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hiking-Checklist.jpg" alt="Hiking Checklist" class="wp-image-23161" srcset="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hiking-Checklist.jpg 1001w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hiking-Checklist-300x120.jpg 300w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hiking-Checklist-770x308.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" data-pin-media="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hiking-Checklist.jpg"></figure></div>



<h3 id="what-to-take-with-you"><span id="What_To_Take_With_You"><strong>What To Take With You</strong></span></h3>



<p>Having the right equipment might seem like an overwhelming problem, but you don&rsquo;t need to buy the whole store! There are just a couple of hiking necessities you need to put in your backpack!</p>



<h4 id="1-backpack"><span id="1_Backpack"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Backpack</strong></span></h4>



<p>First, you should try and get one of the  <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-day-packs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Day Hiking Daypacks</a></strong>. Ideally, it should be the length of your back with bottle holders on the sides and plenty of room in the middle.</p>



<h4 id="2-headlamp"><span id="2_Headlamp"><strong>2. Headlamp</strong></span></h4>



<p>If the darkness rolls in earlier than you expected, then a <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-headlamps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Lightweight Backpacking Headlamp</strong></a> can help you continue on the path until you find a place to rest. The headlamps free up your hands as the light is wrapped around their forehead, but as long as you have a source of light, you will be okay.</p>



<h4 id="3-sunscreen-and-a-hat"><span id="3_Sunscreen_and_a_Hat"><strong>3. Sunscreen and a Hat</strong></span></h4>



<p>Most of the time, you will be hiking during the day, and although sunny weather is more pleasurable than the rain, it doesn&rsquo;t come without trouble. If you have sunscreen and a hat to protect you from getting burnt or developing heatstroke, then you are one step closer to a healthy trip.</p>



<h4 id="4-first-aid-kit"><span id="4_First_Aid_Kit"><strong>4. First Aid Kit</strong></span></h4>



<p>For every 2 people, there should be 1 first aid kit. This kit can contain band-aids, antiseptic wipes, bandages, and other small health aids to stop you from getting an infection while in the wilderness. The most common illness or injury involves blisters. So be sure to know <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/how-to-prevent-blisters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to treat blisters</a></strong>. Hopefully, you will never need to use the equipment, but if you do, it&rsquo;s better to have it on hand. You should also bring toilet paper and a method to bury or dispose of your waste.</p>



<h4 id="5-offline-navigation"><span id="5_Offline_Navigation"><strong>5. Offline Navigation</strong></span></h4>



<p>If you are using an app, Google Maps, or a classic compass, you need a way to travel on your hike without the internet. Many walks don&rsquo;t have internet access, so you shouldn&rsquo;t rely on the service to show you the way. Instead, prepare for an offline experience and make sure you understand your navigation tools before you set out. You might even consider a <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-hiking-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPS Hiking Watch</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-hiking-gps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Handheld GPS Unit</a></strong>.</p>



<h4 id="6-knife-fire-shelter-and-duck-tape"><span id="6_Knife_Fire_Shelter_and_Duck_Tape"><strong>6. Knife, Fire, Shelter, and Duck Tape</strong></span></h4>



<p>If you get stuck in the woods, you need to have a backup plan. Most hikes will not force you into this dramatic issue, and if you only expect to be walking for a couple of hours, you may never need to use this equipment. However, if the worst does happen, you need to make sure that you can settle for the night and try again in the morning. </p>



<p>Firestarters will keep you warm, a knife can help you cut up twigs for burning, duck tape can repair your gear, and a lightweight emergency bivvy is all you need for a temporary shelter.</p>



<p>Keep these items at the bottom of your bag because if you need them, you will be already settling for the evening.</p>



<h4 id="7-extra-food-water-and-clothes"><span id="7_Extra_Food_Water_and_Clothes"><strong>7. Extra Food, Water and Clothes</strong></span></h4>



<p>If the hike burns more of your morning breakfast than you thought, then you will need some sustenance to power you through to the end of the journey. There is no shame in eating as you walk, so put some travel bars in your backpack in case you get peckish. If you don&rsquo;t eat enough, you may end up passing out, so don&rsquo;t push your hunger to one side.</p>



<p>Water is the most important thing you need to take with you. You should be drinking 3000 ml of water a day anyway, but on a hike in the sun, you may need more. Pack as much water as you can reasonably carry, and remember to take breaks to let the body soak in the nutrients.&nbsp;Look for the <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-hydration-bladder/">best quality hydration bladder</a></strong> is a good way to carry water inside your pack. Or look for a <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-filtered-water-bottle/">water bottle with a filter</a></strong> so you can always drink clean water.</p>



<p>A cold front can come from nowhere, so taking an extra jacket or a new pair of sockets is always a must. If you end up walking in a puddle, you need to make sure your feet get dry; otherwise, you will end up with blisters. Replacing wet clothes is an important safety tip.</p>



<h3 id="what-to-wear-hiking"><span id="What_To_Wear_Hiking"><strong>What To Wear Hiking</strong></span></h3>



<p>Although you might be climbing up a height, you will need light and breathable clothing more than thick layers. It will be better to bring an extra jacket to keep warm later on, rather than wearing thick tops and pants to start with.</p>



<h4 id="1-breathable-tops"><span id="1_Breathable_Tops"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Breathable Tops</strong></span></h4>



<p>Breathable tops don&rsquo;t have to be expensive or filled with the latest fabric technology. It can be a cheap workout top you can find at any store. You just want to avoid fabrics like cotton, which still absorb your sweat. If the top absorbs your sweat, it will become cold and heavy as you hike, adding more pressure to your carrying capacity and possibly making you ill or rashy. Take a look at some of the <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-hiking-shirts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Hiking Shirts</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-baselayers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Base Layers</a></strong> for hiking.</p>



<h4 id="2-lightweight-pants"><span id="2_Lightweight_pants"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Lightweight pants</strong></span></h4>



<p>Some people prefer <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-hiking-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lightweight Hiking Shorts</a></strong>, others leggings, but you want a <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-hiking-pants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lightweight Hiking Pants</a></strong> that are comfortable to walk long distances in and won&rsquo;t weigh you down. Jeans should be avoided at all costs.</p>



<p>Some people would suggest avoiding shorts, too, as you will leave your legs open to poison ivy or bramble cuts, but depending on the trail, that might not be an issue.</p>



<h4 id="3-rain-jacket"><span id="3_Rain_Jacket"><strong>3. Rain Jacket</strong></span></h4>



<p>Ideally, you should have a <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/rain-jackets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Lightweight Rain Jacket</strong></a> which can be put into a small, hand-sized bag and hung from your backpack. If a rain cloud comes over you while you walk, this will keep you safe, but you shouldn&rsquo;t need to carry it around with you for the whole trip. I also like the latest <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-hiking-umbrellas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lightweight Hiking Umbrellas</a></strong>. They are not only lightweight but strong enough in all situation except really strong wind. I started hiking with them a few years ago and love them.</p>



<h4 id="4-fleece-jacket"><span id="4_Fleece_Jacket"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Fleece Jacket</strong></span></h4>



<p>Fleece jackets create breathable warmth for cold hikes. They are the perfect jacket to take with you, and you can tie them around your waist when you don&rsquo;t need them. Try to buy one of the <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-mid-layer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Mid Layers for Hiking</a></strong>. They are worth carrying.</p>



<h4 id="5-hiking-boots"><span id="5_Hiking_Boots"><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Hiking Boots</strong></span></h4>



<p>Any shoe with a good grip on the bottom can be used for hiking. If you are new to hiking and don&rsquo;t want to spend tons of money on new equipment, you can opt for <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-trail-running-shoes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trail Running Shoes for Hiking</a></strong> as they have good traction. Because you will be following easier routes, to begin with, you shouldn&rsquo;t need hardcore boots for a while.</p>



<p>When you do eventually buy <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-hiking-boots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Lightweight Waterproof Hiking Boots</strong></a>, make sure to wear them in before traveling to avoid blisters. Don&rsquo;t forget a goof pair of <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-hiking-socks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hiking Socks</a></strong>.</p>



<h2 id="staying-safe-while-hiking"><span id="Staying_Safe_While_Hiking"><strong>Staying Safe While Hiking</strong></span></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="1001" height="401" src="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Staying-Safe-While-Hiking.jpg" alt="Staying Safe While Hiking" class="wp-image-23162" srcset="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Staying-Safe-While-Hiking.jpg 1001w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Staying-Safe-While-Hiking-300x120.jpg 300w, https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Staying-Safe-While-Hiking-770x308.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" data-pin-media="https://bikehikesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Staying-Safe-While-Hiking.jpg"></figure></div>



<p>If you have followed the advice so far, you are on your way to a safe hiking experience. You have an offline map to guide you on your trip, you have chosen a trail that matches your walking skills, you have food, water, and shelter emergency kits readily available in your backpack. You are going great.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are just a couple of extra things you need to do.</p>



<h3 id="1-keep-your-first-aid-kit-up-to-date"><span id="1_Keep_Your_First_Aid_Kit_Up_To_Date">1. <strong>Keep Your First Aid Kit Up To Date</strong></span></h3>



<p>I mentioned first aid kits already, but before you start the hike, double-check your gear is up to date. If you used a band-aid on your previous trip, make sure that it is replaced.</p>



<h3 id="2-tell-a-friend-where-you-are-going-and-when-you-ll-get-back"><span id="2_Tell_A_Friend_Where_You_Are_Going_And_When_Yoursquoll_Get_Back">2. <strong>Tell A Friend Where You Are Going And When You&rsquo;ll Get Back</strong></span></h3>



<p>If something goes wrong, someone needs to know where you are. Give a trusted person all the details of your trip. This includes the map you are following, the food and water you have taken with you, and when you expect to get back. This way, if you don&rsquo;t get back on time, your friend can tell the local rangers that something is wrong.</p>



<p>They will know how much food you have with you, and therefore how much time they have to find you. If your trail is 2 hours long in total, you shouldn&rsquo;t be 5 hours late.</p>



<h3 id="3-put-your-details-in-your-car"><span id="3_Put_Your_Details_In_Your_Car">3. <strong>Put Your Details In Your Car</strong></span></h3>



<p>Everything you told your friend should also be available in your car. The local rangers will notice when a vehicle has been parked for too long and will use it as a sign that someone has gone missing. If you have a little bag of information on the passenger&rsquo;s seat small enough to not warrant a thief&rsquo;s interests but big enough to be noticed by someone worried, then they might break into your car to find this life-saving information.</p>



<h3 id="4-make-sure-the-offline-map-is-accessible"><span id="4_Make_Sure_The_Offline_Map_Is_Accessible">4. <strong>Make Sure The Offline Map Is Accessible</strong></span></h3>



<p>Some may tell you that a picture of your map on your phone is enough, but unless you have a solar-paneled phone charger or a <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-power-bank-for-backpacking/">Power Bank for Backpacking</a></strong>, you run the risk of running out of battery. I suggest you have a paper copy of the map too, so you can always find your way home. Consider taking an <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/best-personal-locator-beacons-satellite-messengers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emergency Hiking Beacon</a></strong> to alert authorities if you need help.</p>
