<h1>AT Day 7 &#8211; My first week in the trail </h1>

<h1>First Week on the Appalachian Trail</h1>



<p><strong>22nd April 2017</strong></p>



<p><strong>19.9 miles</strong></p>



<p><strong>Standing Indian Shelter (86) to Rock Gap (105.9)</strong></p>



<p><span id="selectionBoundary_1492819518918_44678508963053754" class="rangySelectionBoundary" style="line-height: 0; display: none;"></span>I climbed to the top of Standing Indian Mountain, the summit is on a small side trail. I don&rsquo;t think too many hikers make this very short side trip. The view was nice, looking over the lake near Hiawassee. The area has an interesting Cherokee legend attached to it.</p>



<p>The Cherokee have a story about Standing Indian Mountain. Once there were flying monsters that would swoop down and steal children. A warrior was sent to the mountain to keep a look out. He was scared and ran away. As punishment for his cowardly behaviour he was turned to rock. &nbsp;The flying monsters were eventually destroyed by the &lsquo;great spirit&rsquo; who used thunder and lightning to kill them.</p>



<p>The same rock I was standing on at Standing Indian Mountain. In Cherokee language it is called &lsquo;Yunwitsule-nunyi&rsquo;, which translates to &lsquo;where the man stood&rsquo;. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where I travel in the world, the stories from the ancient people not only fascinate me but they all tell a similar story.</p>



<p>After climbing the mountain the rest of the days hiking was relatively easy. I walked an hour or so with a couple of other Aussie hikers, and guess what, they are also cycling around the the world. Small world. I&rsquo;m moving quite a bit faster than them but I hope to meet them at Trail Days in Damascus, Virginia, which is the big hiker gathering on 19-21 May.</p>



<p>There was a short punchy climb up a steep section of trail to Alberta Mountain which had a fire tower on top that was locked, so I missed the 360 degree views.</p>



<p>While at the fire tower there were 3 other hikers. I overheard a phone conversation with a shuttle driver. Pick up at 5pm from Rock Gap, just over 5 miles away. It was 1.30pm. I had enough time to make it there. A good meal and a cold beer was in my mind. I caught my hiking buddy Soop, the only guy hiking at my pace &nbsp;and told him of the new plan.</p>



<p>Only a very short distance after the descent I reached a small rocky set of numerals. I&rsquo;ve reached the 100 mile mark on the Appalachian Trail. If I repeat this kind of distance 21 more times I&rsquo;ll finish the trail. Considering this is Day 7, I&rsquo;m doing quite good for time. Let&rsquo;s hope injury and illness do not affect me.</p>



<p>About 1 mile from the trailhead there was a lady in all sorts of pain. She was hiking awefully slowly with lots of sounds that equalled agony. I offered to carry her pack to the trailhead but she refused. Not long after I met some locals who warned me of a large storm front about to hit the area. A good idea to be in town, I think.</p>



<p>Just before 5pm the shuttle arrived. I ran back up the trail to see if the injured lady was nearby. Thankfully she was close to the end of the trail. I grabbed her backpack off her and told her she only had 200 yards to a van that would take her to the nearest town. I think her hike is over.</p>



<p>We made it to town and had dinner, laundry and resupply completed before the storm hit st 9pm. The forecast called for 4 inches (100mm) of rain. Glad I&rsquo;m not camping tonight.</p>
