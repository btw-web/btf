<h1>AT Day 43 &#8211; The Heavy Backpack and Heavy Rain</h1>

<h1 class="has-text-align-center">Heavy Backpack and Heavy Rain</h1>



<p><strong>28th May</strong></p>



<p><strong>22.3 miles&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong><span id="selectionBoundary_1496020676145_1912030329697033" class="rangySelectionBoundary" style="line-height: 0; display: none;"></span>Daleville (728.1) to Bushcamp (750.4)</strong></p>



<p>The weather forecast called for afternoon rain and thunderstorms. I was happy with that. A couple of days ago the forecast called for a weeks worth of solid rain. A little afternoon rain or a thunderstorm was nothing, or so I thought.</p>



<p>A big breakfast and then we packed our bags ready to hit the trail. I bought way to much food and the result was a grossly overweight backpack. It weighed almost the same as Delicate Flower&rsquo;s backpack. His base weight is around 10-15 pounds heavier than mine.</p>



<p>The first steps were slow and laboured and things didn&rsquo;t improve as the day progressed. I&rsquo;m used to carrying much less weight so my body was not impressed with me today. Anybody hiking the Appalachian Trail with a heavy backpack is making their life harder than it needs to be. My life was hard today.</p>



<p>After only about two miles of hiking Delicate Flower went off ahead. I didn&rsquo;t see him for the rest of the day. Small hills felt like torture for my body. Large hills nearly killed me.</p>



<p>I stopped to eat lunch on top of a large hill. A young guy with an ultra light set up hiked past me, then another. I realised they were slack packing this section. Slack packing is common on the Appalachian Trail. A hiker will pay someone to shuttle them to a part of the trail then they hike a section of trail returning to their accomodation only carrying a Day pack. Hence the light backpacks. I&rsquo;m not against slack packing, I think it&rsquo;s a great idea, I just prefer to be on the trail, rather than in towns.</p>



<p>The weather stayed clear until mid afternoon. Then the heavens opened &nbsp;up in a biblical downpour. The trail became a river. It reminded me of monsoonal storms at home. I wondered if anyone might be building an ark. Even with my umbrella that has served me so well, I was getting wet. A poor turtle was sitting on the middle of the trail. There was so much water I almost stood on it. I moved it a little bit off the trail in case any other hiker cane along. This rain was crazy. Even with the umbrella, every part of me was soaked. I started to chafe between the legs but could not stop to rest. All I could do was embrace the brutality.</p>



<p>There is some crazy part of me that loved this extreme weather. This is my third 2000 plus mile thru hike. I&rsquo;ve faced many challenges with the weather. Extreme heat, extreme cold, extreme altitude, extreme rain, extreme snow and extremely dry deserts. I love extremes. I don&rsquo;t know why, I just do. Possibly, things like this keep me on the trail hiking when other hikers quit. Maybe it&rsquo;s the feeling of being alive, really alive. I shall have to dwell on these thoughts a little longer, then I might have an answer.</p>



<p>After an hour the rain stopped. I could see the vistas for a change. Low cloud lingered in the distant valleys. For the most part of the afternoon the trail followed the Blue Ridge Parkway. Despite being a long weekend there was little traffic. What little traffic there was didn&rsquo;t stop to take in the views.</p>



<p>As evening approached I set up camp on a high ridge, alone. I&rsquo;m not sure where my hiking buddy Delicate Flower is, probably nice and dry in a shelter somewhere. It wasn&rsquo;t long after I set up my tent that another <span id="selectionBoundary_1496107706844_6668386820006594" class="rangySelectionBoundary" style="line-height: 0; display: none;"></span>rain shower passed.<span id="selectionBoundary_1496022691644_7615800018292872" class="rangySelectionBoundary" style="line-height: 0; display: none;"></span></p>
