<h1>PCT Day 35 Return to the Desert</h1>

<p><strong>21st May 2015</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mileage 6.9 (11.1)</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mojave (566.5) to Bushcamp (573.4)</strong></p>



<p><strong>Return to the desert</strong></p>



<p>The 10 hours of restful sleep left me feeling slow and sleepy in the morning. Several days of rest was not necessarily a good thing. I was less than eager to leave. Prior to hitting the trail I had to make a trip to the local post office. I had two packages to send. </p>



<p>The first package was my bear barrel chock full of food to Kennedy Meadows. It&rsquo;s about 120 miles away and the starting point of the Sierras, the high mountains. Bear canisters for food storage are compulsory. In the same box I had an extra clothing layer for the cold and spikes to slip on my shoes in case of slippery ice. </p>



<p>The second package I had to post was my bounce box. I&rsquo;ll see it again in 2 weeks. Hopefully after making it up the Mt Whitney, a 14000+ ft mountain.</p>



<p>I was dropped off the trailhead at 2pm by local trail angel &lsquo;Jedda blue&rsquo;. It was a late start but with my dodgy ankle not yet fully healed, I thought it prudent to hike less than 10 miles. </p>



<p>At many locations along the trail there is a register. Hikers write the date and their name and sometimes a message. Spending so much time resting in Mojave I was able to read the names of hikers I knew. They had now caught up and were now ahead of me. Hopefully I will have a reunion of sorts I&rsquo;m coming days.</p>



<p>The start of the trail follows the highway for about a mile through rather non descript low desert shrubs. There is a noticeable lack of wildflowers. It could be that this area is sporadically grazed by cattle which might lower the diversity. </p>



<p>There&rsquo;s a long climb up to yet another high point on the trail. I spied a group making an early camp among sheltered trees and shrubs. The wind was picking up and now reaching up to 50 mph in gusts. </p>



<p>It was also cold, causing me to add several layers of clothing. It feels so strange to be hiking the most feared section of the desert and feeling so utterly cold. I did of course know the weather was changing for the worse, what I didn&rsquo;t know was how bad or when. Strong wind and rain was predicted during the night.</p>



<p>After just less than 7 miles I found a very sheltered spot and called it a day. My ankle was definitely not 100% and while it felt ok I was happy to give it a rest. I sat in my tent, sheltered from the wind and cold. I think I&rsquo;m going to need my earplugs tonight to block the sound of the wind trying to break the nearby trees and shrubs. It might be a long night.</p>
