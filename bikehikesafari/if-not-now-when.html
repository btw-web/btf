<h1>If not now, when</h1>

<p>If Not Now When. I guess the hardest decision was actually making the decision to go, to travel for such an extended period of time that is. Once the decision was made I felt so much better. But it was a hard decision to give up work for a year, the comforts that I know, the uncertainty, the daily routine that I have become accustomed to. Even if the daily routine had become filled with frustrations as of late. So, yes the decision to go traveling is most definitely not easy.</p>



<h4>Time to sell everything</h4>



<p>I looked around my house. There was an accumulation of so much materialistic stuff. There had to be a cull. I sold the vast majority of my belongings, I just didn&rsquo;t need nor want them anymore. I rented a small storage shed for personal belongings that either meant something to me or would be sorely missed when I return. Some people call it de-cluttering, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only one with too much stuff. Made some handy money in the process, seems recycling is alive and well.</p>



<p>Work is finished for the year, my bike and gear is packed and I&rsquo;m sitting at Darwin airport, a place I&rsquo;ve visited more times than I care to remember. I&rsquo;m escaping the tropical heat, which I love, however, as of the last couple of weeks has transformed into cooling, monsoonal storms. I love this time of year for its unpredictability, natures raw energy, it has a way of letting us know that we are not in charge as much as we like to think.</p>



<p>For my last day I went down to the Darwin Harbour to have one last look at the Monsoonal storms. They inundated the tropical northern coastline, as they do at this time of year. A combination of 8.1 metre high tides and Monsoonal storms created erosive waves that pounded the shoreline. I&rsquo;m not the only one living here who appreciates this kind of weather. A fair old crowd gathered to watch the carnage.</p>



<p>I will miss the tropics, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to the adventure that awaits.</p>
