<h1>Cycling the Ventura Highway in the Sunshine</h1>

<p>Only two small hills stood between me and the flat coastal plains of southern California. I hadn&rsquo;t really taken any notice of where I was going and what sort of sights I might expect for the days ride. </p>



<p>So when I hit the flat coastal plains and observed hundreds of cars and motorhomes parked by the side of the road I was curious. Elephant Seals. Hundreds of Elephant Seals on the beach, just resting. Its not the first time I&rsquo;ve seen these large sea mammals lazing on a beach. </p>



<p>Last year when I first started this journey I found myself <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/hiking-the-south-coast-track/">hiking on a remote beach in southern Tasmania</a></strong>. I found a large seal on the beach, much larger than I&rsquo;d ever seen before. It was an Elephant Seal. They normally don&rsquo;t travel to Australia preferring to stay in the sub Antarctic waters. My sighting was rare. </p>



<p>In fact I was contacted by a scientist that had somehow found my website and was able to identify the very seal I was looking at! Ah Science, gotta love it. Anyway, I stopped and had a wander along the boardwalk to observe these large creatures. If they share anything in common with their southern hemisphere cousins then I suspect they rarely come onto land, spending almost their whole life at sea. But I&rsquo;m not really sure.</p>



<p>A short distance from the Elephant Seal Beach I saw a large gathering of cyclists. I thought about stopping but continued. Turns out it was the turn around point for a 100 mile Saturday morning&nbsp; cycle trip. With my heavy adventure touring bike I couldn&rsquo;t keep up with most of the riders on their 6kg lightweight bikes. </p>



<p>My bike is about 40-45kg fully loaded. As I rode along I was encouraged by the large amount of positive comments I received from the riders. On several occasions I was offered a meal by the riders. Eventually I decided to join them for a meal. It was close to the end of the day and I had planned to camp nearby. Soft delicate meat, baked potato with sour cream, ice cream and cake. So nice at the end of the day.</p>



<p>The following two days were rather boring days of riding a combination of freeways and backroads with little or no shoulder. I decided early on to just make miles as their was little of visual, cultural or natural interest for me. So I just cycled and stopped just long enough to rest and eat. It set me up for another stunning ride as I rode along the coast from Ventura. </p>



<p>So very close to the metropolis that is Santa Barbara and Malibu yet the roads were not crowded. I camped near the coast at the mosquito infested Sycamore Canyon with two German cyclists I met at the previous campground.&nbsp; In between dinner, showers and providing a meal to the mosquitoes we chatted about our travels as is common when a group of touring cyclists get together. </p>



<p>We talked about gear, bikes, destinations, people, other cyclists and more. I mentioned to them about stopping at the Starbucks Cafe in nearby Malibu for a coffee in the morning. I mentioned how I saw some guy called Bruce Jenner when I was there last year. I believe she has now changed his name! Anyway, we all arrived there and went in for a coffee. </p>



<p>I recognised somebody but couldn&rsquo;t quite pick out who it was at first. Turns out it was Chuck Norris. I drank coffee with Chuck Norris. Well, not really, but in the same room as him. I was too shy to ask for a photo, but I did take a photo of his star on Hollywood Boulavard when I was here last year!</p>



<p>The road into Santa Monica was easy enough as I cycled past the beach houses and hilltop mansions. My body was awfully tired. I needed a rest. The pain in my legs and feet have yet to ease. My hike on the <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/hiking-the-pacific-crest-trail/">Pacific Crest Trail </a></strong>has really hurt me and I&rsquo;m looking forward to some time off in Los Angeles to rest, swim at the beach, read and go to the cinema.</p>
