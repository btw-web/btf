<h1>PCT Day 96 Tropic Thunder</h1>

<p><strong>21st July 2015</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mileage 19.8</strong></p>



<p><strong>Castle Crags Campground (1506.5) to (1526.3)</strong></p>



<p>I was the first hiker to leave Castle Crags Campground in the morning. Last night had left some people unable or unwilling to rise. Mental note to self: Do not pitch tent next to picnic table when hikers buy large amounts of alcohol, it makes sleeping impossible. </p>



<p>While I did not partake in the drinking session, well I did have two beers, I was too close to the action to sleep. It was all good natured, they are all great people.</p>



<p>The trail for the morning climbs around the impressive granite spires of Castle Crags. The view was somewhat inhibited by a haze that did its best to dull the colours from the landscape. Was it a heat haze, was it the humidity, was there a nearby fire? I did not know. </p>



<p>I walked alone for most of the morning until about 10.30am when Mr &amp; Mrs Smith caught up. I misread the water report and thought I had to carry water enough for 20 miles. In this heat and with a 4500 foot climb I was loaded up with 5 litres of water. I was also carrying a full resupply of food for 100 miles. </p>



<p>My pack was heavy. Very heavy. I was somewhat embarrassed and disgusted with myself for not being more thorough with my preparations for the day. My body paid the price.</p>



<p>Lunch was taken in the shade of a pine grove. The first crashes of thunder were heard only a couple of miles away. It sounded like it was getting closer.</p>



<p>We continued climbing towards the high point of the day following a stunning ridge line. Mt Shasta was like a magnet for the thunderstorms. Wave after wave of storms seemed be close to us but not dangerously so. Well, until we made camp that is.</p>



<p>Our camp was in a small grove of trees &nbsp;next to an exposed ridge that commanded views to the north. We were joined at this small campsite by Jenraffe and Humpit. </p>



<p>There had been only a few spots of rain but at least 2 lightning strikes were within a mile of camp. We all felt safe but glad not to be on an exposed ridge. After last nights lack of sleep I think sleep should come easy tonight.&nbsp;</p>
