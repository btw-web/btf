<h1>Belize &#8211; An English Speaking country in the Caribbean</h1>

<p>When I enter a new country I always have a nervous feeling in my stomach. Entering Belize was no different. I&rsquo;m not sure why, maybe it&rsquo;s the excitement of something new or maybe it&rsquo;s the feeling of being interrogated by an overly officious border guard. After about 70 odd border crossings that I&rsquo;ve done in my life I should be used to it. Yes, I&rsquo;ve done a lot of traveling in my life. In fact, I&rsquo;ve visited Belize before, many years ago.</p>



<h3>Entering Belize</h3>



<p>I filled out the immigration paperwork and waited in line. I was rejected on my first attempt. Apparently, when asked for my address in Belize it is not appropriate to write, &lsquo;various campsites&rsquo;. I was told I needed a street address and town that I would be staying in tonight. That was hard as I had no wifi to look for an address of a hotel so I did the next best thing. I made up a fake address. </p>



<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time I have resorted to doing such a thing. You would think an experienced traveler like myself would know better. &lsquo;<em>4 Victoria St, San Ignacio</em>&lsquo;, I wrote on my immigration paperwork. I was granted my entry stamp. </p>



<p>I cycled for about an hour from the Guatemalan border to the Belize town of San Ignacio. Belize is an old English colony and they speak the most amazing English. I love the strong Caribbean accent. The people are a mix of ancient Mayans, people of African descent and Europeans.&nbsp; They are incredibly friendly. It&rsquo;s hard to walk anywhere but the busiest street without saying hello to everybody. An they all have the time for a chat.</p>



<h3>San Ignacio</h3>



<p>I settled into a room for a couple of days in San Ignacio. In comparison to Guatemala and Mexico, I must say that Belize is rather expensive. Not as much as USA but noticeably more than it&rsquo;s neighbours. </p>



<p>I resigned my budget to not staying here too long. But first thing was first, food. I found an Indian Restaurant/Bar in the main tourist street. I love Indian food and haven&rsquo;t eaten it in several years. The staff stand out in the street and try their best to induce people to enter. I needed no inducement. </p>



<p>The guy introduced himself as &lsquo;<em>The Mixologist</em>&lsquo;. It didn&rsquo;t help when they had &lsquo;happy hour&rsquo; which seemed to last all day. The rum and fresh pineapple juice went down very well with the Indian food. I returned again the following afternoon for more, it was that good.</p>



<p>Within walking distance of town is the ancient Mayan ruins of Cahal Pech. It is a small site which didn&rsquo;t seem to be popular with the tourist crowds that flock to San Ignacio. It took me less than an hour to wander around the site. There were only about 6 others at the site when I was there. What surprised me most about Belize was the amount of things to do. Tourism seems to have really taken off in this country, much more so than when I was here last. I&rsquo;m already planning to return here next year after my hike on the Appalachian Trail.</p>



<h3>What&rsquo;s next?</h3>



<p>With a couple days of rest I planned a super exciting route through the north western parts of Belize, unfortunately, things did not go to plan. Stay tuned.</p>
