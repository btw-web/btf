<h1>CDT Day 65 Hike Naked Day</h1>

<p><strong>21st June</strong></p>



<p><strong>19.2 miles</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bushcamp (947) to Bushcamp (966.2)</strong></p>



<p>It&rsquo;s world hike naked day. It&rsquo;s also the summer solstice. The longest day of the year and a day to get your kit off and go for a hike.</p>



<p>My hiking mojo is back. I think. I hope. It disappeared somewhere early on in Colorado. In recent days and weeks my attitude about the trail has been rather average. More like a &lsquo;glass half empty&rsquo;, kinda mood. Long distance hiking is like that. It can be an emotional Rollercoaster. I think camping at a lower altitude has done wonders for my energy and mood.</p>



<p>My late sleep in saw me hiking alone for the first couple of hours. I caught Big John at the top of the first 1000ft climb of the morning. We continued along an undulating trail for several miles. A thick forest shaded us from any heat of the sun.</p>



<p>I set off up the long drawn out climb to the top of 12600ft Lake Ann Pass. As I climbed above the tree line I looked for Big John but couldn&rsquo;t see him. Not ahead and not behind. Maybe he took a wrong turn, I thought.</p>



<p>It was after midday when I reached the top of pass. On route I stripped off and hiked to the top naked. It is hike naked day after all. But it was cool at the summit so I wasn&rsquo;t naked very long. Well, I am from the tropics and suffer in the cold. My early enthusiasm for feeling great seems to have taken a turn. Nausea has returned. Seems I&rsquo;m fine at low altitude and horrible above 12000ft. At least my attitude is better.</p>



<p>Big John did make it to the pass about 45 minutes behind me. He had an ablutions break while hidden away from the trail. I didn&rsquo;t see him, thankfully.</p>



<p>We had a minor problem to deal with before we could safely descend. The was a large, unstable cornice of snow that blocked the descent. In places it was overhanging. Not conducive to safe hiking. I chose to take a long way around the corniced snow and descend on a rather sketchy route back to the trail. Big John traversed around the worst of the cornices sections and descended on the snow. We both made it down without incident. I chose to glissade some of the snow sections to make for a quicker descent.</p>



<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before we were on good trail making good time. The clouds were taking on a darker shade of grey every time I looked at them. Rain was coming. We set up camp on a small patch of flat ground, the best we could find. The place had previously been used as a hikers toilet, as evidenced by what was found under a rock.</p>



<p>The rain arrived just as I had my tent set up. I sat in my tent eating to the sound of raindrops beating on tent fly. It had a soothing affect. I was asleep before 8pm.</p>
