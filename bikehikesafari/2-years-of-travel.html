<h1>2 Years of Travel</h1>

<p>1st February is a special date for me. It marks 2 years of travel. On that date in 2014 I started this journey which in many ways has only just begun. My journey is about the spirit of adventure and exploring the most amazing places on the planet. My main mode of transport is my bicycle and my feet.</p>



<p>Let&rsquo;s have a little recap of the last two years of my life. In total I&rsquo;ve cycled over 19400km, hiked 5086km and canoed 715km. <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/my-stats/"><strong>Click here to look at my statistics page</strong>.</a></p>



<p>In February 2014, I started hiking and cycling in Tasmania, Australia. I cycled over 1600km and hiked around 350km in my 10 weeks there. <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/tasmania/">Click here for a link to my Tasmanian adventures.</a></strong></p>



<p>In May 2014 I flew to Alaska to commence a cycling and hiking journey from the most northern roads of Alaska and Canada to the Mexico border. I cycled to the most northern roads in Alaska (<strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/cycling-the-dalton-highway-to-deadhorse-prudhoe-bay-on-the-arctic-ocean/">Dalton Hwy</a></strong>) and the most northern road in Canada (<a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/cycling-the-dempster-hwy-to-inuvik-in-the-canadian-arctic/"><strong>Dempster Hwy</strong></a>). I don&rsquo;t know of any other cyclist that has done such a thing in the same summer season, I&rsquo;m sure they exist but a search of the internet hasn&rsquo;t found any. I had some amazing experiences in Alaska, such as sleeping in a bearproof storage box in <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/biking-and-hiking-denali-national-park/">Denali National Park</a></strong> when a cold winter storm hit and I enjoyed some the best cycling ever on the <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/cycling-the-denali-hwy-from-paxson-to-cantwell/">Denali Highway</a></strong>.</p>



<p>I jumped in a canoe and paddled more than 700km of the Yukon River from WhiteHorse to Dawson City. I took my bicycle with me in the canoe! That was a highlight of my time in the north. <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/2014/08/05/canoeing-the-yukon-river/">Click here to read more about my Yukon Trip.</a></strong></p>



<p>As I headed south I took the chance to hike some amazing trails in USA and Canada. Some of my favourites were <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/hiking-the-west-coast-trail/">The West Coast Trail</a></strong> on Vancouver Island, <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/hiking-and-biking-yosemite-national-park/"><strong>Yosemite</strong></a>, <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/hiking-the-chilkoot-trail/"><strong>The Chilkoot Trail</strong></a> , <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/biking-and-hiking-mt-rainier-national-park/"><strong>Mt Rainier</strong></a> and a 100 mile hike I did in <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/hiking-the-grand-canyon/"><strong>Grand Canyon</strong></a>. I cycled the <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/cycling-the-northern-oregon-coast/"><strong>Oregon</strong></a> and <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/cycling-the-redwoods-of-northern-california/"><strong>California coast</strong></a> to <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/the-streets-of-san-francisco/"><strong>San Francisco</strong></a> before heading inland. I also spent some time in the cold deserts of Utah visiting such amazing places as <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/hiking-and-cycling-bryce-canyon-national-park/"><strong>Bryce Canyon</strong></a>, <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/cycling-and-hiking-zion-national-park/"><strong>Zion NP</strong></a>. <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/cycling-from-meteorite-craters-to-the-apache-trail/"><strong>I was standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona</strong></a> shortly after visiting a big hole in the ground from a meteor.</p>



<p>In Arizona and California I cycled across the Sonoran desert to <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/cycling-across-the-sonoran-desert/">Campo and San Diego</a></strong> by bicycle thus completing my Alaska to Mexico journey. I spent Christmas 2014 alone in San Diego and saw in the year 2015 bar hopping in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>In January 2015 I returned home to Australia, my one year sabbatical from my job was over, but I had a thirst for adventure. I spent 10 weeks at home in Australia. During that time I resigned from my job as a Police Officer, sold everything I owned and hit the road permanently. No fixed address. No responsibilities. Minimal possessions. Freedom.</p>



<p>In April 2015 I returned to USA to hike the <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/hiking-the-pacific-crest-trail/">Pacific Crest Trail</a></strong>. An ambitious hike of 2660 miles from the Mexico Border to the Canadian Border. This extraordinary hike confirmed my new found love of long distance hiking which worked perfectly with my love for nature and long distance cycling.</p>



<p>Upon completing the PCT I had a one week break then flew to <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/cycling-san-francisco-to-santa-cruz/">San Francisco</a></strong> to continue cycling south to Mexico and beyond. Mexico has been another highlight of my journey, constantly surprising me with it&rsquo;s friendliness and beauty. I experienced the stunning beauty of <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/cycling-baja-mexico/">Baja Peninsula</a></strong>, unexpected meetings with the drug cartels in <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/cycling-to-copper-canyon-the-hard-way/">Copper Canyon</a></strong>, the nicest city I&rsquo;ve visited in the Americas <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/zacatecas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Zacatecas</strong></a> and the raw power of nature in the form of <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/2016/01/14/volcan-colima/">volcanoes such as Colima</a></strong> and cycling at 4200m on the frozen landscape of <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/mountain-biking-nevada-de-toluca/">Nevada de Toluca</a></strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/tasmania/"><strong>Tasmania</strong></a>, <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/cycle-touring/"><strong>Alaska</strong>, <strong>Canada</strong>, </a><strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/cycle-touring/">USA and Mexico</a></strong> has provided me with all and much more than I expected.</p>



<p><strong>Have I changed?</strong></p>



<p>As a person I have changed, but not much. I&rsquo;m still that same ordinary person. I just choose to do extraordinary things, to not let my dreams be only dreams. My lack of material possessions has caused my life to be stress free and I live more in the moment rather than waiting for retirement or winning the lottery to do the things I really want to do. </p>



<p>Everything I need in life I carry with me on <a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/the-bike/"><strong>my bicycle</strong></a>, including all my <strong><a href="https://bikehikesafari.com/equiptment/">lightweight hiking gear</a></strong>. I am happy. I am free. I love my life.</p>



<p><strong>How do I fund my lifestyle?</strong></p>



<p>I worked hard my whole life. I always spent less money than I earned. Read that again. I SPEND LESS MONEY THAN I EARN. I LIVE WITHIN MY MEANS. The extra money was invested wisely in property or on the stock market. </p>



<p>I own some property that pays me a small monthly rental income. It&rsquo;s not enough to fund my travels but it partly funds some of it. I&rsquo;m looking at sponsorship and writing to make up a surplus. </p>



<p>Donations are also welcome from any kind readers, there is a donation page on my website now. Thank you to all those that have already donated.</p>



<p>It will be a busy year for me. Life is short, get out there and live it.</p>
