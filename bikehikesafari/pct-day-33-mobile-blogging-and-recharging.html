<h1>PCT Day 33 Mobile Blogging and Recharging</h1>

<p><strong>19th May 2015</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mileage 0</strong></p>



<p><strong>Mojave (566.5)</strong></p>



<p><strong>Blogging PCT</strong></p>



<p>This morning a bid farewell to another of my hiking buddies, Stonefoot as he headed north. I will stay behind to allow my body to heal. I have been hiking with a Physiotherapist recently and have been advised that it would be about 10 days before my ankle would be healed.</p>



<p>The tendons around my ankle are the problem. Not the kind of news I wanted to hear. I was also advised that after about 3 days things should be OK to hike but would take quite a while longer to fully heal itself. So I will rest and prepare to head out hiking by Thursday afternoon.</p>



<p>I thought as I am resting in town in might let people now how I write my blog and what technology I am using on the trail. Everything I do is on my Iphone 5. Firstly, I write my blog on the WordPress App which can be used offline. My camera (Canon G16 + spare battery) has WiFi and allows me to transfer all my photos to my phone, I then upload them to my WordPress App.</p>



<p>All this is done in the evening while lounging around camp. It normally takes me around 45 minutes to write, transfer photos and upload everything. I apologise for my poor grammer or spelling, I don&rsquo;t have the time to proof read or re-write things as much as I might like.</p>



<p>I send out my blog post when I have Cell Phone reception, I am using AT&amp;T. Sometimes I have no cell phone reception for days. And it will get worse as I leave my relative comfort of Mojave. I also link the blog to my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bikehikesafari" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>FaceBook Site</strong></a> and when I have time I also send photos to my <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bikehikesafari/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Navigation is primarily through the Guthook App when on trail and Pocket Earth App when in town.</p>



<p>I check the weather on my &lsquo;Weather Channel&rsquo; App. I check where the next water is on the <a href="https://pctwater.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>PCT Water Report</strong></a>. I download the latest reports on a regular basis and transfer it to my Ibooks on my phone.</p>



<p>While hiking I listen to music, podcasts and audiobooks and at night if I have time and energy I read books on the Kindle App on my phone.</p>



<p>All this drains the battery on my phone. At the end of everyday I charge my phone with my PowerGen 12000mAh battery. This gives me about 7-9 days of charge to my Iphone. When I arrive in town I seek out a power outlet to charge my phone and PowerGen battery.</p>



<p>I carry a USB charger and cables with me. It takes about 6 hours to fully charge the battery. All cafes, hostels etc so far have power outlets for hikers. I think 4 hours is the shortest amount of time I have spent in a town so that is enough to &lsquo;top up&rsquo; the charge on my electronics.</p>



<p>I also travel with a bounce box that I post to myself as I travel down the trail. It contains my camera battery charger, spare shoes, toiletries, extra food etc. As I travel to the cold of the Sierras I take out my cold weather gear to hike with, when I get further north I will bounce my clothes further down the trail. I generally post it down the trail every 150-200 miles or so. Everything I mentioned seems to work well for me and still gives me the time to enjoy the trail without spending too much time focusing on technology.</p>
