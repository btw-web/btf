<p>You want to travel the world by bike, but you&#8217;re unsure about WHAT to pack&#8230; and HOW exactly you should pack it all on your bicycle.</p>
<p>In this article I will demonstrate to you how I pack my current touring bicycle (a <em>Co-Motion Pangea</em>), my four <em>Ortlieb</em> panniers and my single <em>Ortlieb</em> handlebar bag. Inside the bags that hang off my bike are everything I need to survive for months at a time &#8211; as you will see in just a moment.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that this is just ONE WAY of packing your belongings for a long-distance bicycle touring adventure. WHAT items you choose to pack and HOW you choose to store your particular belongings is going to depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you are going in the world</li>
<li>What the road conditions are like in that area (paved roads vs. dirt/mud/ice/snow)</li>
<li>How long you are going to be traveling (a couple days vs. several weeks or months)</li>
<li>Where you will be sleeping at night (camping vs. staying in hotels)</li>
<li>Personal preference</li>
<li>And a number of other factors (which I lay out in further detail inside <em><a title="How to conduct a bike tour" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/the-bicycle-travelers-blueprint/">The Bicycle Traveler&#8217;s Blueprint</a></em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the video above and in the notes below, you are seeing the way I have chosen to pack for <a title="My bicycle touring plans for 2012" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/my-bicycle-touring-travel-plans-for-2012/">my current 13+ month bicycle tour across Europe</a> and Africa. What you pack for your own bicycle touring adventure and how you choose to pack your belongings on your bike may vary greatly. However, there are a few points worth noting in the video above, so no matter where you plan to travel with your bike in the world or how long you plan to be on the road, you are sure to gain an important piece of information from this article.</p>
<h3>Gear Selection (What To Pack &amp; What To Leave At Home)</h3>
<p>A detailed breakdown of everything I&#8217;m currently carrying with me on my bicycle can be accessed in this article: <a title="What to pack for a long-distance bike tour" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/europe-bicycle-tour-packing-list/">What to Pack for a Year-Long Bicycle Tour</a>. If you are wondering what sleeping pad I use or which type of cameras I am traveling with, that article will tell you everything you need to know.</p>
<p>The important thing to note in this video is that I am carrying a lot of electronic items with me &#8211; way more electronics than the average bicycle traveler will (or probably should) carry with him.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m carrying so many electronics is because 1) I work while I travel. This is how I am able to stay on the road for so long. Instead of saving up a bunch of money working a 9-5 job and then getting a bunch of time off work to burn through my savings while I travel around the world (as many people choose to do it), I work and travel at the same time. Because I have a job that allows me to work from anywhere in the world so long as I have access to the Internet, I can actually make money while bicycle touring across the globe. But working while I travel also means that I have to carry everything I need for my work with me. In this case, it means carrying a laptop, two external hard drives, two to three cameras, a tripod, solar charger and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>The other reason I have so many electronics is because 2) these electronic items help me stay connected with my friends and family back home. When you travel for such a long period of time (several months), being able to communicate with those closest to you on a regular basis makes the loneliness and boredom that frequently are associated with long-term travel that much easier to cope with. So I carry a few items (like my iPod) that are largely unnecessary, but I use them to stay sane &#8211; by listening to music, playing games, calling (via <em>Skype</em>) my friends and family back home, etc.</p>
<p>If you are planning a long-distance bicycle tour, I do not recommend you carry as many electronics as I am currently carrying. If you can get by with just a cell/smart phone and a point and shoot camera, then that&#8217;s probably all you need. Plus, you&#8217;ll be happy to be not carrying all the weight that I currently am. Trust me, packing light is a huge advantage when traveling long distances by bike. Don&#8217;t follow my example here. Pack as little as you can, while at the same time carrying everything you need for your particular tour.</p>
<p>Because I am carrying so many electronics on my bike, it means I had to make a few sacrifices in other areas &#8211; namely in the amount of gear I carry for cooking. On most of my bike tours in the past I have carried a small, one-burner camp stove and titanium pot/lid with me so that I could cook my own warm meals when I was out on the road. But because I need to carry a laptop, two+ cameras and a whole host of other work related items with me at the moment, I chose to leave the camp stove at home on this particular tour. By doing so, it has required me to eat cold picnic style meals on most days, while occasionally stopping for a warm meal at a restaurant or cafe whenever I can. To supplement my lack of a camp stove, I also rent the occasional apartment during my travels and use the supplied kitchenette to cook myself some rice, vegetables, pasta and other such warm meals on a full size stove.</p>
<p>Carrying a camp stove is a traditional thing to do when conducting a long-distance bicycle tour, but it is one of those things that you don&#8217;t really need in many of parts of the world (such as Europe) where warm food and delicious meals can be found around nearly every bend in the road. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to eliminate even more weight from your touring bicycle, consider ditching your camp stove, fuel and cook pot and instead commit yourself to eating picnic lunches and warm meals in restaurants every night. (Again, this can&#8217;t be done in every part of the world, but for many bicycle travelers this can easily be accomplished.)</p>
<h3>Packing Your Handlebar Bag</h3>
<p>The video above explains just about everything you need to know about what I&#8217;ve packed in my bicycle&#8217;s handlebar bag. What the video doesn&#8217;t mention, however, is that the items I&#8217;ve chosen to carry in my handlebar bag are the items I need to access most frequently when I am either on my bike during the day or in my tent at night. This is why my iPod (used for navigation and entertainment), camera(s), headlamp, and wallet are all carried in my handlebar bag.</p>
<p>In the video you will also see that I am carrying a set of keys tied to a small lanyard inside my handlebar bag. These are spare keys for my bike lock, just in case I were to lose the key that goes with the lock itself, I would have a spare key hidden inside my handlebar bag (which I carry with me everywhere when I am off the bike), so I could unlock my bicycle in the event of misplacing the other key. I have locked my bike up before and then <a title="Whoops. I forgot to pack my bike lock key" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/3-things-i-learned-from-my-first-mountain-bike-tour/">realized I did not have the key with me</a>, so I&#8217;m trying to avoid making this mistake again by simply carrying a backup key.</p>
<p>On the sides of my <em>Ortlieb</em> handlebar bag are two small mesh pockets, which I use to store my multi-tool, patch kit, tire levels, lighter, chap stick and a few spare <a title="What are bicycle rack screws" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/how-not-to-get-screwed-by-carrying-extra-screws/">rack screws</a>. Ideally I would carry these items in a rear pannier (or somewhere kind of out of the way) because I rarely ever use them, but all of these items are rather small and easy to lose inside my giant panniers, so even though they are kind of out of place when stored in my handlebar bag, they are safe, protected, and easy to find whenever I need to access them. Small items like this are best stored in small pockets or bags of some kind so they don&#8217;t get lost and are easy to access when you need them.</p>

<h3>Notes On How To Pack Your Panniers</h3>
<p>Over the years I have written dozens of articles about how to pack your panniers. The article I wrote for the <em>Adventure Cycling Associate</em> titled &#8220;<a title="7 secrets to successfully packing your panniers" href="http://blog.adventurecycling.org/2009/12/7-secrets-to-successfully-packing-your.html#.URJCtOiyz2E" target="_blank">7 Secrets To Successfully Packing Your Panniers</a>&#8220;, however, is probably one of the best guides I have ever produced to packing your panniers for a long-distance bike tour. In addition to that one article, I recommend you read:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="How to pack bicycle touring panniers" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/how-to-pack-your-panniers/">How To Pack Your Panniers</a> (the first article I ever wrote on the subject)</li>
<li><a title="An inside look at pannier packing" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/how-to-pack-your-panniers-for-a-bicycle-tour-an-inside-look/">How To Pack Your Panniers: An Inside Look</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The most important notes to consider after watching the video above are:</p>
<p>I always put everything back in the same place each and every time I pack up my bicycle. This allows me to quickly and easily access items without having to constantly dig through all four panniers to find the item I am looking for. If you store your belongings in the same place inside your panniers, you will save yourself a massive amount of time (and a number of annoying headaches) once you get out on the road.</p>
<p>Heavier (less frequently accessed items) should be stored near the bottom of  your panniers, while lighter (more frequently accessed items) should be stored near the top. Keeping your weight as low to the ground as possible is important for controlling your bicycle at high speeds and for simply keeping your bicycle in good working condition &#8211; as I explain in great detail inside the <a title="secret to packing your panniers" href="http://blog.adventurecycling.org/2009/12/7-secrets-to-successfully-packing-your.html#.URJEJeiyz2E" target="_blank">7 Secrets to Successfully Packing Your Panniers</a>.</p>
<p>In the video above I also mention that I am carrying a pant leg protector. A pant leg protector is a simple fabric and <em>Velcro</em> strap that wraps around your right pant leg when you are riding your bicycle in long pants and it prevents your pant leg from getting caught in your bicycle&#8217;s drive-train. If you a touring in the summer (and wearing shorts every day) then you don&#8217;t need a pant leg protector. I am carrying a pant leg protector in this video because I am touring in both summer and <a title="winter bicycle touring" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/winter-cycling-book/">winter</a> conditions. Therefore, I knew in advance that I would be wearing shorts during the hot months of summer and would be wearing long pants during the winter (and that I would therefore need to also pack a pant leg protector for my wintertime exploits).</p>
<p>Another point worth mentioning when packing your panniers is that you need to always leave some extra room inside your panniers for food and other items you might choose to pick up along the way. If you leave home and your panniers are packed to the gills, but you haven&#8217;t left any room to carry any food, you are carrying way too much stuff. You need to leave some extra room in your panniers for food. I recommend having at least half a pannier&#8217;s worth of space dedicated to storing food (this space can be spread out across all of your panniers &#8211; as I have done in this video). It may look like the panniers in this video are fully packed, but there is actually about 1/4 of each pannier that is empty and can be used to store a small amount of food.</p>
<p>In my left rear pannier I store all of my camping equipment. Many bicycle travelers will store these items on the top of their rear rack, but I like to carry them inside my panniers so they are protected from the elements (sun and rain/snow/etc) and also so I don&#8217;t have to worry about these items falling off the back of my bike at some random point during the day. With these items stored inside a single pannier they are easy to access at the end of the day and easy to pack up again in the morning.</p>
<p>If, however, my tent gets wet at night and it is still wet in the morning when I pack it up again, I usually don&#8217;t want to put it in the same pannier as my sleeping bag, because my sleeping bag might get wet and that would make the following night&#8217;s sleep a terrible, terrible experience. So if my tent gets wet, that&#8217;s when I do resort to bungee cording it to the rear rack of my bicycle &#8211; at least until it dries out. After the tent has dried, I place it back inside my rear pannier with all the rest of my camping gear&#8230; and then I continue on my way.</p>
<p>In the video above I also point out that I store my bicycle&#8217;s chain lube in the small mesh pocket on the outside of my left rear pannier. I mention that I keep it here so it is easy to access, but mainly because if the bottle of lube were to open, it wouldn&#8217;t spill all over my belongings inside my panniers. This is an important point to make, not just when referring to chain lube, but to any liquid item that you store inside your panniers.</p>
<p>I make a special point never to store liquids (or anything sticky, squishy, etc) inside panniers that contain electronic items or anything of major importance to me (in the wintertime, this would mean clothing &#8211; because if you get your clothes wet in the winter, you are screwed!). So be careful what you put in your panniers. If you put a bottle of orange juice in the same pannier as your laptop, for example, and that bottle or orange juice starts to drip at some point during your ride, you might discover that you&#8217;ve totally ruined your laptop at the end of the day. Don&#8217;t make that mistake! Pack liquids on the outside of your panniers or, at the very least, away from items that can not be easily dried out at the end of the day.</p>
<p>My right rear pannier (shown in great detail in the video above) is my &#8220;work pannier.&#8221; This is the bag where I store my computer, external hard drives, backpack, and a number of other personal items. This entire pannier contains items that most bicycle travelers will never need or want to carry. I do not recommend you carry most (or any) of these things. If you are a normal bicycle traveler conducting a traditional bicycle tour, you might replace everything you see in my rear right pannier with a simple camp stove and pot and then use the rest of the space to store food and other personal items.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also carrying two different set of shoes in the video above (one set of shoes to cycle in and another pair of shoes to walk around in). Many bicycle travelers will carry only one pair of shoes (a pair of shoes that doubles as both a walking and a cycling shoe). However, when you are traveling for months on end, you tend to do just as much walking as you do cycling, so it becomes increasingly more important to have a good pair of walking shoes on a long-distance tour.</p>
<p>In fact, many long-distance cyclists choose to get rid of their cycling shoes altogether and opt for a simple pair of walking shoes instead (making sure that the walking shoes can also be used on the bike as well). The goal for many long-distance bicycle travelers is not speed or even efficiently, so giving up a dedicated pair of cycling shoes for more off the bike comfort is a perfectly fine move to make in some instances.</p>
<p>You will also see that I am carrying a small backpack with me inside my rear right pannier. In my early days of bicycle touring I never carried a backpack with me. Instead, if I wanted to carry a few belongings with me, I simply used my handlebar bag or one of my small front panniers as a sort of large purse that I would have to carry around with me in my hand. But using a handlebar bag or a pannier to carry your belongings around a large city, for example, for months on end is not a fun way to travel. So I again opted to take a non-traditional approach to bicycle touring and packed a lightweight backpack inside one of my rear panniers. Frankly, I can not imagine traveling for more than a year without a backpack. I walk around large cities with it (using it to carry my large SLR camera and tripod, as well as my rain jacket, water, wallet and other personal items) and I also use it on a regular basis to carry food and drinks from local supermarkets back to my hotel, campsite or apartment.</p>
<p>Under ideal circumstances it would be great to have a pannier that doubled as a stylish and super functional backpack. In fact, there are many backpack/pannier combo products that exist. I&#8217;ve reviewed a few of them here on this website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Lone Peak pannier/backpack" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/video-review-of-the-lone-peak-pd-200-mount-olympus-pannierday-pack/">Lone Peak PD-200 Mount Olympus Pannier/Day Pack</a></li>
<li><a title="Scion backpack pannier" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/scicon-transalp-2-0-bicycle-pannierbackpack/">Scion TransAlp 2.0 Bicycle Pannier/Backpack</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, none of the products I&#8217;ve experimented with are things I would actually ever use on a long-distance bicycle tour (the <em>Lone Peak</em> backpack/pannier isn&#8217;t waterproof and the <em>Scion TransAlp</em> panniers are too small.</p>
<p>Once again, carrying a backpack is not a bicycle touring necessity, but in some instances it is a nice thing to have.</p>
<h3>Packing Up The Bike &#8211; Same Way Every Time</h3>
<p>Finally, after the handlebar bag and panniers are packed, I place the bags back on my bicycle. It should be noted that I place the items on my bicycle in the exact same order almost every time I pack up my bike. The bungee cord is run through the straps on the back of the solar panel and the bungee cord is then attached to the rear rack. Then the two rear panniers go on (I do them first because placing the front panniers on first tends to make the bicycle difficult to balance). Then the bag containing my tripod and tent poles slides in underneath the bungee cord on the rear rack. Once the rear end of my bike is secured, I move to the front. I place on the two front panniers and then lock the handlebar bag in position.</p>
<p>Before cycling off, I look the bike over really quick, double-checking that all the panniers are properly secured to the racks, making sure that none of the straps from the panniers are hanging into my spokes or drive-train, looking to make sure I haven&#8217;t left anything on the ground in the area, and then I pedal off!</p>
<p>If you have questions about how to pack your bicycle for a long-distance bicycle tour, be sure you pick up a copy of my wildly popular book, &#8220;<a title="The Bicycle TOuring How To Book" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/the-bicycle-travelers-blueprint/">The Bicycle Traveler&#8217;s Blueprint: The Definitive Guide To Self-Supported Bicycle Touring</a>.&#8221; Or leave a comment below and I will respond just as soon as I possibly can!</p>
