<h1>Women&#8217;s Triathlon Shoes &#8211; A Collection Of The World&#8217;s Best Triathlon Shoes For Women</h1>

<p>Women&#8217;s triathlon shoes are a unique breed of cycling shoe. They are lightweight, stiff (in order to provide a powerful stroke when you&#8217;re riding your bicycle), aerodynamic, breathable (so your feet stay cool and dry), and easy to get on and off &#8211; which is important during the fast transitions between triathlon stages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click here to see the list of <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/mens-triathlon-shoes/">men&#8217;s TRIATHLON SHOES</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes women&#8217;s triathlon shoes different from men&#8217;s triathlon shoes? Well, the colors and styles are obviously different. Women&#8217;s triathlon shoes tend to feature softer, lighter colors &#8211; such as white, light blue, silver, pink and yellow&#8230; while men&#8217;s shoes are often times black, red, gray, green, etc.</p>
<p>Because triathlon shoes are meant to sometimes be worn without socks (allowing you to slip into the shoes quickly as soon as you jump out of the swimming stage of the triathlon or Ironman competition), many of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=women%20triathlon%20shoes&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=bicycletouringpro-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;linkId=IJDRUMBZ2TLNHISW" target="_blank">women&#8217;s triathlon shoes</a> you see on this page are tighter and more narrow than their regular road racing shoe counterparts. For this reason, we recommend you consider buying a pair of women&#8217;s triathlon shoes that are a half-size larger than you might normally wear &#8211; especially if you plan to wear the shoes with socks! This will ensure that the shoes no only fit, but that they don&#8217;t rub or aggravate the skin on your foot in areas that might cause a blister or pain of any kind.</p>
<p>So take a look through the women&#8217;s triathlon shoes on this page. Pick out the shoe you like most and then click the related links to learn more about the shoes you like and place an order for your very own triathlon shoes.</p>

<p>The features you want in your triathlon shoes are the same as what you want in a road shoe; stiff soles, lightweight construction, and footbeds that keep your feet comfortable on long rides. But women&#8217;s triathlon shoes require a few additions that differ from traditional road shoes, namely a wider entrance for your foot, a simpler, two-strap closure, and extra ventilation to keep your feet dry. The Giro Women&#8217;s Triathlon shoes have all the features we look for in cycling shoes, with essential triathlon-specific details to make them comfortable and quick in transitions.</p>

<p>With a wide throat opening, lightweight design, and women&#8217;s-specific fit, Giro&#8217;s Flynt Women&#8217;s Triathlon Shoes were built with all the details that matter most to triathletes. The uppers were made from a breathable microfiber and air mesh, along with a dual strap closure. The hook-and-loop strap over the forefoot keeps your foot secure while pedaling, and the complementary upper strap provides a smooth wrap for added stability. These wide straps, combined with a large heel loop, make transitions go as smoothly as possible.</p>

<p>Triathlons are an expensive pastime, but Louis Garneau Tri-X Speed II Women&#8217;s Triathlon Shoes make it a little simpler to afford all the other gear you need. They don&#8217;t disregard function to lower the price-tag, though. The X-Speed II uses the same outside-to-inside Power Flex strap as the top-end Louis Garneau models, so you can fine tune your fit and easily open and close your shoes while you&#8217;re in the saddle. The outsole has been reinforced to increase stiffness and power. Throw in a large heel strap for smooth speed in the transition zone and a weight that totals well under 300 grams, and you&#8217;ll be blowing the competition away while laughing at their more expensive gear.</p>

<p>No matter how much you empty yourself during the cycling stage of your triathlon, it&#8217;s all for naught if your feet are incapable of carrying you across the finish line. If your women&#8217;s-specific triathlon shoes are giving you hot spots, that nuisance in the saddle will quickly become crippling when it&#8217;s time to run. With this in mind, the Sidi T3 Air Women&#8217;s Shoes deliver a perfect anatomical fit and supreme comfort, without sacrificing any of the legendary Sidi power transfer. First and foremost, Sidi designed the T3 Shoe around a women&#8217;s-specific shape. This means that the shoe is wider in the forefoot and narrower toward the heel in comparison to the men&#8217;s shape. Additionally, the women&#8217;s T3 features a lower overall volume. So, from a purely functional standpoint, we can agree that rigidity is key. That&#8217;s why Sidi uses a multi-step system to ensure that your power output receives a minimal amount of dissipation through the interaction of the shoe and the pedal.</p>
