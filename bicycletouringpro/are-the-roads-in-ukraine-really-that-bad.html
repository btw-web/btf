<p>People told me the roads in Ukraine were bad, but I didn&#8217;t exactly believe them.</p>
<p>After two weeks of bike touring in Ukraine, however, I discovered what they were talking about. There are indeed some bad roads in Ukraine.</p>
<p>But the truth is, most of the roads aren&#8217;t that bad. At least, they weren&#8217;t as bad as I thought they were going to be.</p>
<p>This road here is one of the worst I saw in Ukraine. But even here the bad section only lasted for a couple hundred meters before it dried out and became rideable once again.</p>
<p>To me, this isn&#8217;t a bad road. A bad road is something that looks like this but stretches across the entire country. That&#8217;s a bad road! But I never saw anything like that on my bike ride across Ukraine.</p>
<p>The worst part about bicycle touring across Ukraine was not the condition of the roads, but the conditions in the sky. During my time in Ukraine I saw the sky only two times. The rest of the time I was engulfed in a never-ended gray cloud of fog. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll remember about Ukraine! I won&#8217;t remember the bad roads. I&#8217;ll remember the gray, cold fog.</p>
