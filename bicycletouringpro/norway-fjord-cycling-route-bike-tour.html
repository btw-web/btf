<h3>Before The Tour Begins</h3>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs2">With this self-guided cycling tour (arranged by <em>Berg Fritid)</em> you are in for a real treat! All you have to do is get to Norway for the start of the tour!</span></p>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs2">The tour begins and ends in the small town of </span><span class="ecxs2">Matre</span><span class="ecxs2">, Norway. </span><span class="ecxs2">Matre</span><span class="ecxs2"> is a 90 minute bus</span><span class="ecxs2"> </span><span class="ecxs2">ride north from </span>Bergen &#8211; <span class="ecxs2">the second largest city in Norway</span><span class="ecxs2">. </span><span class="ecxs2">Bergen is worth a visit for its many sightseeing and tourist activities and is easily reachable as it is home to an international airport. Consider staying in Bergen’s city center at least a night or two before the tour begins. The next day (the start of your tour) you can easily find the central bus station in downtown Bergen and take the 8:00 am or 12:30 pm bus (#430) into </span><span class="ecxs2">Matre</span><span class="ecxs2">.</span></p>
<h3>Tour Overview</h3>
<p><span class="ecxs2">After arriving to </span><span class="ecxs2">Matre</span><span class="ecxs2"> in the early afternoon</span><span class="ecxs2"> on the first day of the tour</span><span class="ecxs2">, you will have time to visit the Bjorn West </span><span class="ecxs2">Museum </span><span class="ecxs2">where you will learn the history of how the area was affected during World War II. It is easy to see how nature has played a role in the history and development of this small town. Learning about Matre will get you excited about all that you will see in the few days of cycling ahead of you; most especially the nature you will see, feel and breath in on the bike. </span></p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">From </span><span class="ecxs2">Matre</span><span class="ecxs2">, you will cycle just 17 kilometers north-east until </span><span class="ecxs2">y</span><span class="ecxs2">ou reach your first hotel, the </span><span class="ecxs2">Stordalen </span><span class="ecxs2">Fjellstove</span><span class="ecxs2">. </span>There is a steep uphill challenge  during this first day of cycling, but the scenery is so captivating you&#8217;ll hardly feel the burn.</p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">You may wish to add an extra night onto the tour here at the </span><span class="ecxs2">Stordalen</span><span class="ecxs2"> </span><span class="ecxs2">Fjellstove</span><span class="ecxs2"> to enjoy the lakefront hotel and surrounding area &#8211; especially the mountain biking (weather permitting). If you are interested in mountain biking, <em>Berg </em></span><span class="ecxs2">Fritid</span><span class="ecxs2">,</span><span class="ecxs2"> will provide you with mountain bikes at the hotel. I could have stayed any number of extra nights at this hotel (or really any of them along the way). I was especially taken by this lakefront hotel&#8217;s views, the cabin-like feel, the generous downstairs seating, great meals and friendly staff.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-28905" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4395-660x435.jpg" alt="bike path in matre norway" width="660" height="435" /></p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">Your second day of cycling (and longest at 66 km) will take you farther north to the waters of </span><span class="ecxs2">the </span><span class="ecxs2">S</span><span class="ecxs2">ognefjord &#8211; </span><span class="ecxs2">Norway’s longest and deepest fjord</span><span class="ecxs2">. Cycling along the edge of the road where the land meets the water was spectacular! Being on the bike will allow you to fully appreciate and take in the beauty of this truly unique area. </span></p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">You’ll eventually turn to the west, cycling along paved roads that follow the water of the S</span><span class="ecxs2">ognefjord</span><span class="ecxs2">, which offers gorgeous views of calm waters</span><span class="ecxs2">, green foliage</span><span class="ecxs2">, red cabins and </span><span class="ecxs2">snow</span><span class="ecxs2">-spotted mountains. It&#8217;s here that you have the option of stopping at the </span><span class="ecxs2">Massnes</span><span class="ecxs2"> Wildlife Museum, which is a quirky collection of a local man&#8217;s passions for nature and animals, which you will see in the numerous taxidermy displays. It is well worth a visit as you will learn about the many animals of the area and likely be enamored with the owner. Plus, it offers a break from the bike before reaching the hotel </span><span class="ecxs2">Brekkestranda</span><span class="ecxs2">. </span></p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">The Brekkestranda (your hotel for the night) is an architectural beauty with dark wood walls, a grass roof, plenty of windows and not a single right angle. The view of the Sognefjord from the hotel is forever imprinted in my mind and will undoubtedly make an impression on you as well. We enjoyed a three-course dinner there and woke up with a plentiful breakfast buffet.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29045" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4732-660x442.jpg" alt="Katelyn Miller bicycle touring pro in norway" width="660" height="442" /></p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">The third day of cycling is a 46 kilometer bike ride that will take you t</span><span class="ecxs2">o the most western part of the </span><span class="ecxs2">S</span><span class="ecxs2">ognefjord</span><span class="ecxs2">, then south into the small historic town of Eivindvik. This was my favorite day of the bike tour as we encountered a long downhill the delivered us to a path right near the water. Being on the bike on that kind of a road was such an adrenaline rush. All of my senses were engaged, including smell when the salty air blasted us right before we reached the bottom. </span></p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">I remember a tough hill toward the end of the day that took us passed the small town of Djnga, but I also remember waterfalls trickling down the sides of the mountain, just near our road. </span></p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">The </span><span class="ecxs2">Eivindvik</span><span class="ecxs2"> fjord hotel is right on the water and </span><span class="ecxs2">and</span><span class="ecxs2"> centrally located in the small town so you can easily explore, or relax on the balcony and just take in the views. At the Eivindvik Fjord Hotel, I was delighted by the hospitable staff and fresh brewed coffee in the afternoon when we arrived. I also enjoyed the fresh baked bread offered as one of the many options in the breakfast buffet.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29058" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2015/08/IMG_5090-660x440.jpg" alt="Woman on bicycle with blue short and red pannier" width="660" height="440" /></p>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs2">The </span><span class="ecxs2">fourth</span><span class="ecxs2"> day of the Fhjord Cycling Route bike tour begins with a ferry ride to the city of </span><span class="ecxs2">Mjømna</span><span class="ecxs2">. There is a direct ferry (less than thirty minutes)</span><span class="ecxs2">, or a longer one (just over an</span><span class="ecxs2"> hour) that you can take to see many of the small islands around the western part of the country. From </span><span class="ecxs2">Mjømna</span><span class="ecxs2">, </span><span class="ecxs2">enjoy spectacular views as you</span><span class="ecxs2"> cycle 32 kilometers over bridges connecting different islands and past the world’s second largest oil refinery.</span></p>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs2">The last stretch follows along a river where you will find the </span><span class="ecxs2">Froyset </span><span class="ecxs2">Gardsmat &#8211; </span><span class="ecxs2">your charming farmhouse hotel. Once at the hotel, you can choose to regroup for a bit of dirt road trail riding in a nearby valley or perhaps a short local hike. Or if you prefer, you can simply sit and relax in this charming farmhouse. I personally couldn&#8217;t get enough of this farmhouse and would love to go back to spend more time there.<br />
</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29072" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2015/08/IMG_5369-660x440.jpg" alt="vegetable lasagne" width="660" height="440" /></p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">The last day is a 42 kilometer ride that takes you mostly along a river and back into the tiny town of </span><span class="ecxs2">Matre </span><span class="ecxs2">where the tour began. You can choose to stop in the small town of </span><span class="ecxs2">Solheim</span><span class="ecxs2"> before the last leg of the trip, but keep an eye on your time if you are headed back to Bergen. In which case you’ll need to allow time to return your bags, reorganize and catch the 16:50 bus. The last few hundred meters of your tour are a bumpy downhill on an old road that will take you straight back to the Bjorn West Museum. </span></p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">Being an active tourist provided such a sense of accomplishment, which was a great feeling to take home with me, along with the many wonderful memories.</span></p>

<h3>The Hotels &amp; Accommodations</h3>
<p><span class="ecxs2">I was charmed by every one of the hotels on the bike tour and I’m sure you will be too. Some language and cultural barriers should be expected when traveling in foreign </span><span class="ecxs2">countries; but every </span><span class="ecxs2">hotel staff member we met spoke English and was helpful, friendly and accommodating. Every hotel had free </span><span class="ecxs2">wi-fi</span><span class="ecxs2"> and was able to cater to specific dietary preferences.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-28909" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4576-660x441.jpg" alt="IMG_4576" width="660" height="441" /></p>
<p><strong>STORDALLEN FJELLSTOVE</strong></p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">The long kitchen counter is where you will find your room key when you check into this charming hotel with its beautiful red exterior. The location, situated on a small lake, is ideal </span><span class="ecxs2">as it</span><span class="ecxs2"> offers beautiful views of lake water, snow-spotted hills, waterfalls and occasional sheep passing by. The dining room offers lots of seating, and adjoining sitting rooms are perfect for sitting back with a cup of tea or coffee. The rooms are charming</span><span class="ecxs2"> with</span><span class="ecxs2"> wood accents (we had wooden bunk beds!) flannel curtains</span><span class="ecxs2"> and spotless white bathrooms.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29054" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4971-660x438.jpg" alt="grass covered hotel in norway" width="660" height="438" /></p>
<p><strong>BREKKESTRANDA</strong></p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">You’ll recognize this hotel while you’re still on the bike, riding towards it. Its roof is a grassy lawn &#8211; a bright green contrast to the hotel’s dark brown, wooden exterior.  What really stands out is the architecture. The architect that designed the hotel had specifications that there wouldn’t be a single right angle in the hotel. Even some of the windows and doors that seem to have right angles are tilted by at least one degree. The number of windows is truly impressive &#8211; most of them a different shape. The windows offer plenty of natural light into the well-designed rooms and a gorgeous view outside of the waters of the </span><span class="ecxs2">Sognefjord</span><span class="ecxs2">.  </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29060" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2015/08/IMG_5141-660x481.jpg" alt="Eivanvik Hotel in Eivanvik, Norway" width="660" height="481" /></p>
<p><strong>EIVINDVIK FJORD HOTEL (Gulen Hotel)</strong></p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">As you ride into the sweet, small town of </span><span class="ecxs2">Eivindvik</span><span class="ecxs2">, </span><span class="ecxs2">you’ll</span><span class="ecxs2"> be hoping that your hotel is right in the center of town. </span><span class="ecxs2">You’ll</span><span class="ecxs2"> be happy to find that it is, plus it&#8217;s right next to a supermarket and situated at the water’s edge. The interior is more modern than the other hotels on this bike tour</span><span class="ecxs2">; it feels like it was recently remodeled. We enjoyed the long balcony that overlooked the water.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29065" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2015/08/IMG_5241-660x440.jpg" alt="froysett gartmat hotel room interior" width="660" height="440" /></p>
<p><strong>FRØYSETH GARDSMAT</strong></p>
<p><span class="ecxs2">Homemade signs on </span><span class="ecxs2">poster board</span><span class="ecxs2"> will help you find your way to this old farmhouse that has been converted into a hotel. </span><span class="ecxs2">Shortly after, you’ll meet the couple that owns the place and the husband’s mother who does all of the cooking. The farmhouse has </span><span class="ecxs2">only a few </span><span class="ecxs2">rooms to choose from &#8211; all of them furnished with antiques; the beds covered in handmade quilts. You’ll have access to the kitchen, newly refinished bathroom, laundry machine, and adorable sitting room. The surrounding area offers hiking, walking or more cycling if you so choose. </span><span class="ecxs2">You can make your trip longer by staying at any one of these charming hotels; but this one was my personal favorite.</span></p>
<h3>Who Is This Bike Tour Designed For?</h3>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs4">This self-guided bike tour in beautiful fjord Norway is ideal for those able to cycle for several hours a day and cover moderate distances.</span><span class="ecxs2"> The entire tour is on paved roads, but there are plenty of u</span><span class="ecxs2">phill (and </span><span class="ecxs2">downhills</span><span class="ecxs2">) each day. If you are intimidated, keep in mind </span><span class="ecxs2">that </span><span class="ecxs2">a mid-morning start</span><span class="ecxs2"> each day allows for plenty of breaks for taking in the scenery, eating, re-hydrating, or just resting! </span><span class="ecxs2">Additionally, you can request to add an extra night’s stay onto any of the hotels along the way to have a day off the bike.</span></p>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs4">Also, keep in mind that you won&#8217;t be traveling with a guide, so cyclists will need to be confident in map-reading/navigating and repairing their bikes.</span><span class="ecxs2"> This is a self-guided tour, meaning you will be provided the tools and materials to complete the trip on your own. The company is always available by phone but </span><span class="ecxs2">you will be expected to follow the map and directions and carry out any necessary repairs.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29074" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2015/08/IMG_5487-660x440.jpg" alt="Couple cycling in Norway valley" width="660" height="440" /></p>
<h3>Advantages of a Self-Guided Bike Tour</h3>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs4">I found that a self-guided tour suited my travel style and has many benefits:</span></p>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs4">1.  <strong>Eliminate the planning </strong></span><span class="ecxs2">&#8211; your bikes, your route, your hotels and your meals are all arranged for </span><span class="ecxs2">you</span><span class="ecxs2"> in advance by the tour company, <em>Berg </em></span><em><span class="ecxs2">Fritid</span></em><span class="ecxs2">.</span></p>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs4">2.  <strong>Choose your travel companion </strong></span><span class="ecxs2">&#8211; This isn’t a group tour, so you decide who you would like to travel with. You can even travel alone if you like; Norway is a safe country with low crime rates.</span></p>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs4">3.  <strong>Go at your own pace </strong></span><span class="ecxs2">&#8211; No need to keep up with a large group.  You have the map and the tools to get you through each day and you have plenty of time to enjoy each day, or if you prefer, to race along at your own pace.</span></p>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs4">4.  <strong>Stay at a hotel each night </strong></span><span class="ecxs2">&#8211; The hotels are arranged for you along </span><span class="ecxs2">with</span><span class="ecxs2"> breakfast, lunch and dinner at each one &#8211; a lovely </span><span class="ecxs2">start and finish to</span><span class="ecxs2"> a day of cycling.</span></p>
<h3>Additional Costs</h3>
<p class="ecxs2">Your hotels, breakfast, lunch and dinner will be provided with the cost of the tour, but you’ll want to have some extra money on hand. <span class="ecxs2">The Norwegian currency is the Norwegian </span><span class="ecxs2">Krone</span><span class="ecxs2">. It is available for exchange at the Bergen airport and available to withdrawal at ATMs along your route. Debit and credit cards are widely accepted but I like to travel with at least a bit of local currency.  </span></p>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs2">Here are a few of the additional expenses to keep in mind:</span></p>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bus tickets</span> &#8211; you will have to pay for your bus</span><span class="ecxs2"> </span><span class="ecxs2">ride to and from </span><span class="ecxs2">Matre</span> <span class="ecxs2"> as well as any transportation the day before and after your tour.</span></p>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ferry ride </span>&#8211; The fare for the ferry ride on the fourth day of the trip is not included. It cost 95 </span><span class="ecxs2">Krone</span><span class="ecxs2"> and can be paid for with cash or card.</span></p>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Snacks and drinks</span> &#8211; All meals are included with the bike tour, but you might want to stop for snacks or drinks along the route. There are some supermarkets along the way and also a few small stores where you can stop for a rest and get something to drink.</span></p>
<p class="ecxs2"><span class="ecxs2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hotel in Bergen</span> &#8211; All hotel accommodation is included along the way, but it is recommended you stay in Bergen the night before the trip begins.</span></p>

<h3>Fjord Cycling Route Bike Tour &#8211; Summary</h3>
<p><span class="ecxs2">Norway has so much to offer: history, hospitality, nature and scenery. I learned more on this trip than I had imagined and I got to enjoy the nature and scenery by being right in it on the bike.  I was overwhelmed by the kindness of all the people we encountered along the way. I was pleasantly surprised by even the smallest things, like not having to lock our bikes and drinking fresh water out of the tap. </span>I enjoyed the worry-free ease with which we could travel because <em>Berg Fritid</em> took care of all of the logistics for us.
