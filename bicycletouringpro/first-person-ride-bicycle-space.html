<p>On Thursday, March 31, 2016, The Russian Corporation for Spacetime Activities, commonly known as <em>Ruscosmos</em>, announced that in the spring of 2017, they plan to send a rocket into space carrying four volunteer astronauts&#8230; and I am going to be one of those four people! The goal of the mission, <em>Ruscosmos</em> announced, is to circle the moon and return to earth on a spaceship powered completely by renewable energy sources. Nothing like this has ever been attempted in mankind&#8217;s history!</p>
<p>The Russian&#8217;s new rocket will be powered in three majors ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Solar Power</strong> &#8211; Energy captured from the sun via solar panels mounted on the spaceship&#8217;s exterior.</li>
<li><strong>Solar Wind</strong> &#8211; Making use of a captured stream of energized particles flowing outward from the sun.</li>
<li><strong>Pedal Power</strong> &#8211; The transfer of energy from a human source through the use of a foot pedal and crank system.</li>
</ol>
<p>You&#8217;re probably familiar with solar power and solar wind technologies and how they work &#8211; even in the vacuum of space. But what makes this Russian space flight so unique is its intended use of a pedal-powered aircraft.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right! This new Russian rocket is going to be powered, in small part, by a device similar to a bicycle. If the mission is a success, the entire space industry could be turned on its head and we could soon have trained cyclists (not astronauts or engineers) flying across the solar system on pedal-powered spaceships.</p>
<p>When <em>Ruscosmos</em> heard about my 16+ years of cycling experience as the <a href="https://www.bicycletouringpro.com"><em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em></a>, the fact that I&#8217;m an avid video blogger (a skill they hope to use during live broadcasts from outer-space), and the fact that I already speak a little Russian (thanks in part to my previous bicycle touring expeditions in <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/poznan-to-gdansk-poland/">Poland</a>, <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/cycling-eastern-europe-poland-ukraine-romania-bike-tour/">Ukraine</a>, <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/chisinau-moldova/">Moldova</a> and <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/cycling-transnistria/">Transnistria</a>), they instantly signed me on as one of the mission&#8217;s four integral team members. A trained pilot (from Russia) and an engineer (from nearby Kyrgyzstan) will be accompanying me on the journey, but the fourth team member has yet to be assigned.</p>
<p>The flight is only scheduled to last one day, with the take-off, complete orbit of the moon, re-entry, and the rocket landing within just a few short hours. But let&#8217;s be honest &#8211; the flight is a risky one, as there will be no back-up energy source on-board. If any of the spaceship&#8217;s three on-board power sources fail, re-entry could be difficult, if not impossible.</p>
<p>My role for the mission is pretty straight forward. I&#8217;m to spend approximately 13 straight hours strapped into what looks like a futuristic dental chair, while using both my legs and my hands (at the same time) to power a series of cranks, which generate electricity and thrust for the rocket&#8217;s main rear engine. I have almost a year to prepare for the mission, but lots of training to do in the meantime. While my lower body is strong (thanks to the thousands and thousands of miles I&#8217;ve already pedaled my bicycle here on earth), my upper body is weak and needs a lot of work &#8211; as do my skills with the Russian language.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m super excited at the prospect of this new Russian space flight and I&#8217;m honored that they would select me as the team&#8217;s pedal-powered ambassador.

<p>Did you like my story? Did I fool you? Did you forget that today is the first day of April? Did you actually believe a bicycle-powered spaceship was a real thing? Would you go into space if you were given the opportunity? Leave a comment below and let me know what you were thinking as you were reading all of this! I had a lot of fun writing this&#8230; so I&#8217;d love to hear what you have to say.</p>
