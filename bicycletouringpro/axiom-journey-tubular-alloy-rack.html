<h1>Axiom Journey Tubular Alloy Rack</h1>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7573" title="Axiom Journey bike touring bicycle rack" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/07/IMG_3426-588x392.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="439" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are you looking for a good, quality bike rack at an affordable price? If so, the <a title="Journey bicycle rack from Axiom" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002994ES4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bicycletouringpro-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002994ES4" target="_blank"><em>Journey</em> bike rack from <em>Axiom</em></a> might just be the perfect rack for you!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I spoke to the <em>Axiom </em>representative at last year&#8217;s <em>Interbike </em>trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada he informed me that many people have a negative image of the company because the prices of their products are so incredibly affordable. He speculated that because the prices were so low, consumers viewed the products as less reliable than other, higher-priced products produced by other companies. And I have to admit, I too had this opinion of the company. I&#8217;ve been familiar with <em>Axiom </em>for many years now and had always assumed that because their prices were so low, their products must not be up to the standards of other bicycle companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, it was my great surprise when <em>Axiom </em>sent me a box full of products &#8211; each of which has made me reconsider my opinion of the company and the products they produce.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a title="Axiom Journey rack" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002994ES4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bicycletouringpro-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002994ES4" target="_blank"><em>Journey</em> bike rack</a> was one of the products sent to me in the <em>Axiom </em>review package and it is probably my favorite of all the products they sent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rack, which is made out of aluminum (and not steel, like more expensive <em>Tubus </em>bike racks) weighs about 700 grams, fits on bicycles with 26&#8243;, 27&#8243; and 700c wheels, and features a triple chainstay design with sweepback support made to keep your panniers from bouncing into your wheels while you ride. The <em>Journey </em>rack also has a small reflector/light mount on its tail end and a Versalock mounting system (that makes installing the rack super easy) on its front. Priced at just $35 Canadian Dollars ($34 USD, it&#8217;s a great rack that can be used for commuting, touring, or anything in-between.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7572" title="journey bike rack from Axiom" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/07/journey-1-588x588.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="659" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But if the rack is so great, why is it so cheap?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, one of the main reasons the <em>Journey </em>is so affordable is because it is made out of aluminum rather than steel. Just like bicycles that are made out of aluminum rather than steel, aluminum products are cheaper to produce and therefore cost the consumer much less money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The advantage of steel, however, is that it is a much more flexible material, which makes it better at absorbing the bumps and weight that touring demands. Aluminum, for the most part, is a much more rigid material and doesn&#8217;t handle the demands of heavy-duty riding nearly as well as steel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, what exactly does this mean for you? Well, I think it means that because the rack is made of aluminum and comes with a price tag that is dramatically less than its steel counterparts, this is the type of bike rack best used in paved road conditions. While the rack is designed to handle as much as 70kg/154lbs of weight, I probably wouldn&#8217;t take it on a tour that requires serious off-road riding. It&#8217;s a rack made for long-distance road riding. For off-road riding, a steel bike rack would be preferred.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, the <em>Axiom Journey </em>bike rack is a quality rack with a stylish design at an affordable price. I like this rack so much that I&#8217;ve personally replaced the old steel rack on my touring bike with <a title="journey bicycle touring rack" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002994ES4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bicycletouringpro-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002994ES4" target="_blank">the <em>Journey</em></a> and I suspect it will remain there for a very long time to come.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">My Overall Rating: 9 out of 10</h3>
