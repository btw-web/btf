<h1>Snake Hunting In Croatia</h1>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-4194 alignleft" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;" title="snake-hunting-croatia" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2009/05/snake-hunting-croatia.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="442" />I went for a hike the other day in the mountains above my apartment in Orebic, Croatia. It was hot and sunny and the snakes were out enjoying the warm weather.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the hike up, I saw three snakes &#8211; two alive and one dead.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They don&#8217;t look like any kind of snake I&#8217;ve ever seen before &#8211; more like salamanders than snakes. But not knowing whether they&#8217;re poisonous or not, I treat them as though they are and run like a girl whenever I see one.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was already a little nervous about being so far out from civilization by myself and in a place swarming with snakes, but then I suddenly heard the large crack of branches on the trail ahead of me as a man dressed in full head-to-toe camouflage stepped out of the bushes carrying an 18 inch machete!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He quickly stepped my way, saying something to me in Croatian or Bosnian or who knows what language.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Do you speak English?&#8221; I ask him, as he stepped within a couple feet of me, his machete high in the air.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Yes. A little.&#8221; he says. &#8220;Where you going!?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Looking more at the blade than at his dark bearded face I tell the man that I&#8217;m simply going on a hike and planned to walk to the top of the mountain where the trail eventually dies out. But he doesn&#8217;t seem to understand though, as he asks me three more times, &#8220;Where you going?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I point and finally get the message across.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Okay&#8221; he says &#8220;But watch out! There is lots of snakes. It is hot today and snakes like it hot.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ve seen a couple of them&#8221; I say to the man. His eyes bug out and for a moment he looks like a scared little child, nearly on the verge of a whimper. Apparently he&#8217;s afraid of snakes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With such a limited vocabulary, the conversation between the man and I quickly dies out and I start to walk in the direction I was heading (At this point I feel like retreating down the mountain might make me appear scared, inferior, or vulnerable, so I continue up the mountain along my intended path).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But as I go to turn my back to the man he says to me again, &#8220;Watch out for snakes&#8221; and taps me on the arm with the broad side of the machete before walking off down the trail in the direction I had just come.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Needless to say, the rest of the hike was a desperate attempt to keep one eye peeled on the ground for any snakes that might slither into my path&#8230; and one eye peeled in the bushes, watching to make sure no more men carrying machetes and dressed in head-to-toe camouflage were going to pop out and interrogate me.</p>
