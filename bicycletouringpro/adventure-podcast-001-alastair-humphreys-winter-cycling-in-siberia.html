<p>In the first episode of the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro </em>audio podcast I speak with British adventurer, author and motivational speaker, <a title="Who is Alastair Humphreys?" href="http://www.alastairhumphreys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alastair Humphreys</a>. In the bicycle touring world, Alastair is best known for his four-year-long bike trip around the world, which resulted in two incredible books about his journey. (Click the following links to read my reviews of Alastair&#8217;s books &#8211; <a title="Alastair Humphreys bicycle book 1" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/around-the-world-by-bike-part-1-alastair-humphreys-moods-of-future-joys-book-review/">#1</a> &amp; <a title="Alastair Humphreys books" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/thunder-and-sunshine-alastair-humphreys-cycle-touring-book-review/">#2</a>)</p>
<p>Since cycling around the world, Alastair has walked across southern India, rowed a boat across the Atlantic Ocean, run 6 marathons across the Sahara desert, raised thousands of dollars for charitable causes, was named as one of <em>National Geographic’s</em> &#8220;Adventurers of the Year&#8221; in 2012 and speaks to audiences all around the world about the lessons he’s learned from his travels in more than 80 different countries all around the world.</p>
<p>In addition to all that, Alastair Humphreys is the author of more than a half-dozen books, including his most recent hit, “<a title="Microadventures book" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/microadventures-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">Microadventures: Local Discoveries for Great Escapes</a>” in which he spread the message that “Adventure is everywhere, every day, and it’s up to us to find it.”</p>

<h3>Here&#8217;s What You Can Expect To Learn</h3>
<p>With so many possible subjects to discuss with Alastair in this first episode of the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro Adventure Podcast</em>, I decided to focus our time in this interview on his experiences cycling in Siberia, which he did during the wintertime as a part of his 4-year-long bike tour around the world. I decided to focus on this specific part of Alastair&#8217;s bike ride because it&#8217;s currently the middle of winter here in the northern hemisphere and I thought that now would be a good time for Alastair to pass on some of his tips and tricks for cycling in the cold, wet, ice and snow.</p>
<p>During this short 16-minute audio interview with Alastair Humphreys, you will learn how he survived the brutally cold weather he encountered while cycling in Siberia, how he found food and water to consume along the way, how he stayed both mentally and physically fit during his endeavor, and what he thinks about other people taking up similar winter cycling adventures.</p>
<p>Make sure you listen to the special &#8220;Microadventures&#8221; bonus round at the end of this first episode to hear about the time Alastair was nearly arrested for riding a bicycle in the nude through a Japanese town!</p>
