<p>People always ask me, &#8220;Darren, how is it that you can afford to do so much traveling?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true! I do travel a lot. I&#8217;ve been <a title="bicycle touring for 14 years" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/why-ive-gone-bicycle-touring-every-single-year-for-the-past-14-years-in-a-row/">bicycle touring around the world for the last 14 years</a> in a row, but I am not a wealthy man.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways I have been able to do as much traveling as I have over the last 14 years, but my biggest secret is this: <strong>When given the choice, I almost always choose to spend my money on experiences, rather than things.</strong></p>
<p>Instead of buying new clothes all the time, I wear pretty much the same thing, every single day, for years on end. (Seriously, go back and look at the pictures from my travels. I&#8217;ve almost always got the same clothes on, day after day.)</p>
<p>Instead of owning a car, I get around on my bike, or I take the bus or hitch a ride with friends. I occasionally fly on airplanes and travel on boats and trains as well.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a new flat-screen TV, a garage full of stuff I don&#8217;t use, or a big house I can&#8217;t afford.</p>
<p>With the little money I do make, I choose to spend most of it on my bicycle touring adventures. This is the number one way I&#8217;ve been able to do so much traveling over the last 14 years. I simply choose not to spend my money on a bunch of stuff I don&#8217;t really need&#8230; and instead, choose to spend my money on experiences I will remember for the rest of my life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer.” – Unknown</em></p>
<p>I have close friends, and will occasionally meet someone on my travels, who asks me, &#8220;Darren, how do you afford to do all this traveling?&#8221; The answer is really quite simple.</p>
<p>The way I&#8217;ve been able to afford to go bicycle touring year after year is by simply giving up the things so many of us tell ourselves we need.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t buy a new TV this year&#8230; and you can go on that bicycle tour you&#8217;ve been dreaming about!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Get rid of your car&#8230; and you can go on that bicycle tour you&#8217;ve been dreaming about!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Take care of the things you currently own&#8230; and you can go on that bicycle tour you&#8217;ve been dreaming about!</li>
</ul>
<p>While this technique won&#8217;t work for everyone, it might just work for you.</p>
<p>What big purchase could you give up in order to make your dreams of traveling the world a reality? Or what small every-day expense could you get rid of in order to make that big bike tour you&#8217;ve been dreaming about come true?</p>
<p>Think about it! I bet you there is something you could do right now to find the little bit of money you need to travel the world, live your dreams, and make memories you will remember for the rest of your life.</p>
