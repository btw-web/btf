<p>Here&#8217;s a short interview with <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> reader, Clayton Campbell, after he recently completed a 90-day <a title="self-supported cycle touring" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/the-bicycle-travelers-blueprint/">self-supported cycle tour</a> in the southern portion of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Where did you go during your bicycle tour and how many days were you on the road?</strong></p>
<p>I landed at the Miami, Florida airport and rode my loaded &#8217;84 KHS tourer to New Mexico into what I believe was Westerly winds. I used the Northerly Atlantic coastline roads then hit old Highway 90 as a rough guide mostly riding along the Gulf region. I was on the road for a little more than 90 days. Being basically a camp oriented cyclist, I tended to camp whenever and wherever I chose. I do prefer a leisurely morning coffee as a ritual start-up to begin the day.</p>
<p><strong>What was your biggest fear when planning or preparing for your trip by bike? And how exactly did you overcome that fear?</strong></p>
<p>My fear was robbers or things that go bump in the night. I overcame that fear by using foam ear plugs, which were very helpful. I also found that choosing concealed sleep areas were very important and that river areas provided the best camp options. In civilized locations, I liked camping around radio transmitter towers as they seemed the safest and cleanest areas that were always well maintained.</p>
<p><strong>What was the thing you liked most about your bicycle touring experience?</strong></p>
<p>I enjoyed the open freedom of movement, unrestricted travel in any direction I choose.</p>
<p><strong>What was the thing you liked LEAST about your bicycle touring experience?</strong></p>
<p>The least liked experience were the people I met and how they viewed cyclists as second class citizens that were always looking for a handout. I feel there is a general disrespect for those who are homeless.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing you learned from your bicycle tour?</strong></p>
<p>Good food, rest and a positive attitude can overcome many difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>What one piece of advice would you give to someone planning his or her first bicycle tour?</strong></p>
<p>Just do it!</p>
