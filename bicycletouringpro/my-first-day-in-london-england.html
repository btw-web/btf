<h1>My First Day In London, England</h1>
<p>I was a bit fearful about flying into London, England. I&#8217;ve never been to the city before (or the country for that matter) and I knew that I was going to be greeted by a sheer mass of people &#8211; something I generally try and avoid.</p>
<p>I was surprised, however, to find my exit at the Heathrow International airport somewhat stress-free. The officials at the airport had no problem with me assembling my bicycle right outside the arrivals door and I was able to jump on a bike path almost immediately after exiting the airport. The difficult part, of course, was cycling on the left-hand side of the road and remembering to look the correct way before crossing the street. I nearly got run over by a few buses, and a few speedy drivers were quick to blow their horns at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; I thought to myself, &#8220;this is my first time ever riding on the left-hand side of the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>I landed in London right around noon and had made plans to spend the night with a <em>BicycleTouringPro.com</em> reader who had contacted me just a couple weeks before, so I had plenty of time to make my way to her home in Farnham Common. She hadn&#8217;t given me the address of the home, but instead, just the name of the house itself (each house in the city has a different name). So I had to search the entire area, house by house, until I accidentally stumbled upon the correct home on the north-east side of the city.</p>
<p>Once I had arrived, I was greeted by my host and quickly welcomed into the house where I took a shower and was introduced to her roommates. Later that night we all went out for Indian food at a nearby restaurant (my first time ever eating at an Indian restaurant) where the waiter hovered over me, watched me chew my food, and waited anxiously for something to do. When I dropped my napkin on the floor, he swooped in and picked it up for me.</p>
<p>If being in England, cycling on the other side of the road, and spending the night with a house full of strangers wasn&#8217;t strange enough, my Indian food restaurant experience certainly put my first day in London over the top.</p>
<p>After dinner I hung out with the roommates in ther living room where we watched a zombie movie before I retired to my tent, which I had pitched in the backyard of their home. The next morning, I woke up, disassembled my tent, and waved goodbye. I was in London, England&#8230; and now I was completely on my own.</p>
