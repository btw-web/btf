<h1>500 Free Articles About Bicycle Touring</h1>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-35157" src="https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Tromso-Norway-Day-2-4590-660x396.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="396" /></p>
<p>One mile after another. That&#8217;s how I got through my first ten years of long-distance bicycle touring. I just put my head down and focused on the gravel road directly in front of me.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve discovered over the years is that if you think about the end goal too much it can become somewhat difficult to continue. Having an end goal is good, of course, and thinking about the thousands of miles ahead can be exciting. But it can also become downright depressing and scary if you start thinking too far into the future!</p>
<p>So, to keep your bicycle headed in the right direction, you sometimes have to forget about the end goal and concentrate on the road that&#8217;s directly in front of you. You gotta focus on climbing that short hill, and then once you reach the top, you gotta aim for next small incline on the horizon.</p>
<p>One mile after another. That&#8217;s how you do it!</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s been running the website here at <em>BicycleTouringPro.com</em>.</p>
<p>For a little more than three years now I&#8217;ve sat down at my computer on a near daily basis to write about and produce videos about my bicycle touring experiences. I never intended to produce this much material&#8230; and I never thought the readership here at <em>BTP </em>(as I like to call it) would ever be so large.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s what happens when you put your head down, forget about the finish line, and focus on the next few steps. You make incredible progress!!!</p>
<p>This past Monday I published my <a title="500th article on bicycle touring pro - bicycle touring in italy lonely planet book review" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/cycling-italy-lonely-planet-guidebook/">500th article</a> here on the website. 500 free articles about bicycle touring and world travel. I can&#8217;t believe it!</p>
<p>On top of the 500 free articles I&#8217;ve written over the past three years, I&#8217;ve also produced <a title="bicycle touring books" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/resources/">3 separate books about bike travel</a>, created a feature-length <a title="bicycle touring movie" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/movie/">bicycle touring movie</a>, traveled through a couple dozen countries myself, and added several thousand miles to my personal bicycle touring odometer.</p>
<p>It seems like a lot to have accomplished in a little over three years, but then I think about how much more I&#8217;ve got to say&#8230; how much more I&#8217;ve got to teach&#8230; and how much more I&#8217;ve got to learn.</p>
<p>More than anything, publishing my 500th free article this past week makes me realize just how thankful I am that I can lead this incredibly bizarre lifestyle that I lead. And I realize that it is YOU, my readers, that help to make this possible.</p>
<p>So, I want to take this moment (the week after publishing my <a title="500 free articles about bicycle touring" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/category/2/">500th free article</a> about bicycle touring) to THANK YOU for being a part of <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em>. I couldn&#8217;t have done this without you&#8230; your emails&#8230; your comments&#8230; your feedback&#8230; your advice&#8230; and your support.</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>
<p>I look forward to producing another 500 articles for you over the next several years&#8230; and I look forward to hearing about your future bicycle touring experiences.</p>
<p>From my current location in Cuzco, Peru&#8230; THANK YOU!</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong> &#8211; That picture at the top of this article is a picture of me on my very first bike tour &#8211; cycling down the California Coastline during the summer after I graduated from high school. It seems like just yesterday.</p>
