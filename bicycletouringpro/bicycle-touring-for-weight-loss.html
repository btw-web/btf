<h1>Bicycle Touring For Weight Loss</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is it possible to use a bike tour as a means of losing weight?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Think about it! On a long-distance bike tour you spend day after day on your bicycle, pedaling for hours on end, climbing hills, battling the wind, and pushing your bike. Surely all of that exertion has to pay off in weight loss&#8230; right?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the years I&#8217;ve met dozens of people who have been traveling by bike in an attempt to lose weight. And personally, I think bike travel is a great way to go about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But recently, I asked readers here at <em>BicycleTouringPro.com </em>to add their two cents to the issue and tell me whether or not they lost weight on their previous bike tours&#8230; and if so, how much weight they lost. The results of that survey are shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7067" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="weightloss-chart2" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/06/weightloss-chart2.jpg" alt="" width="153" height="338" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This isn&#8217;t the greatest graph in the world, but what is shown here is that of those <a title="Bike touring weight loss survey" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/weight-loss-bike-trip-poll/">surveyed</a>, most people who go on a bike trip actually gain weight &#8211; not lose it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, there were quite a few people who admitted to having lost anywhere from 5-20 lbs, but there were also a lot of people who said their weight did not change &#8211; even after a long distance trip by bike.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More interesting than the survey results, however, are some of the responses that were garnished via <em>Bicycle Touring Pro&#8217;s <a title="Bicycle Touring Pro facebook page" href="http://www.facebook.com/bicycletouring" target="_blank">Facebook </a></em><a title="Bicycle Touring Pro facebook page" href="http://www.facebook.com/bicycletouring" target="_blank">page</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7066" title="facebook-weightloss" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/06/facebook-weightloss.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="892" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I created the survey asking people about their experience losing weight while on a bike tour I was expecting a flood of individuals to tell me that they lost massive amounts of weight. But that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some people said they were able to lose 50 pounds or more, but overall that seems to be pretty rare.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More common, it seems, is that the amount of energy required to ride a bike for long distances forces individuals traveling by bike to eat massive amounts of food. So much food in fact, that many of the people who set out on a trip by bike either come back home having lost no weight at all&#8230; or in some cases, having actually put on a few pounds!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My personal experience with weight loss over the past ten years of long-distance cycling is that I always lose weight. At home, I weight a constant 155-160 pounds. At 6 feet, 1 Inch, I am a lightweight. But on my bike trips, I typically drop between 10 and 15 pounds and gain it back quickly once I return home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes right down to it though, I think weight loss on a bike tour is entirely possible&#8230; and traveling by bike might be a great way for overweight individuals to get outside, do something fun, and lose weight in the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But if you are thinking about traveling by bike and using your trip as a means of losing weight, I think the food you eat while on the road is going to play a huge part in whether or not you end up losing any weight at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see by some of the <em><a title="cycle touring on facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/bicycletouring" target="_blank">Facebook</a> </em>responses above, riding a bike for long hours doesn&#8217;t guarantee weight loss. The food you eat and the amount of food you consume plays a huge role in the outcome of your tour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So my advice to you is this: If you are planning to use your trip by bike as a means of losing weight, watch what you eat! Bike touring can make you incredibly hungry and you&#8217;ll want to eat anything you can get your hands on, so you have to have some self-control. Set a diet for yourself before you leave home &#8211; and stick to it once you get out on the road. If you need to, consult a doctor before and/or during your trip to make sure you are eating the right kinds of foods and consuming enough food to keep  you powered up during your cycling expedition. But if weight loss is your goal, don&#8217;t over eat! That seems to be the key!</p>
