<h3>Cycling In Sweden With Pablo &amp; Ana And Their Dog Hippie</h3>

<h3>Bike Touring in Sweden &#8211; Wet, Windy Weather</h3>
<p>Sweden is flat, which is great for bicycle touring (or cycling of any type), but the fact that it&#8217;s flat also makes the country vulnerable to wind. During their first full day in the country, Darren, Pablo, Ana and Hippie encounter a fair amount of rain and wind, making the riding a bit more difficult than any of them had expected.</p>

<h3>Bike Canine &#8211; Cycling With A Dog</h3>
<p>Pablo and Ana are an amazing young couple from northern Spain who have cycled across Europe with their friendly dog Hippie. On most days, Hippie rides in a large basket mounted to the back of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNqvgQogIG8" target="_blank">Pablo&#8217;s Surly Big Dummy touring bicycle</a>. But on uphills, Hippie jumps out and runs alongside Pablo on his loaded touring bike.</p>

<h3>Funny Tourists in Gothenburg, Sweden</h3>
<p>After a night camping on the edge of a small lake, Pablo, Ana, Darren and Hippie (the dog) cycle to the nearby town of Gothenburg, Sweden, where they meet up with one of Ana&#8217;s friends from Spain. her friend invites them into her home, gives them a place to sleep for the night, and lets them take a much-needed shower.</p>

<h3>Camping on an Island in Sweden</h3>
<p>After saying goodbye to Pablo and Ana and their dog Hippie, Darren continues cycling in Sweden &#8211; north toward Oslo, Norway and all on his own. It takes Darren a while to get back into the groove again and remember what it&#8217;s like to cycle by himself, but it doesn&#8217;t take long for his bicycle touring roots to grow back. He spends the night camping in a beautiful, green forest on a small island in western Sweden.</p>

<h3>Deer Attack!</h3>
<p>Darren is woken up in the middle of the night by a large deer charging at his tent, barking and making all sorts of noise. After a restless night of wild camping in the Swedish forests, Darren continues his bicycle touring adventure and continues biking north toward Oslo, Norway.</p>

<h3>People Can&#8217;t Read&#8230; And Other Things I Think About</h3>
<p>When you travel by bicycle for days, weeks or months on end, you have a lot of time to just sit and think. In this episode of the Bicycle Touring Pro travel vlog series, Darren Alff explains how he keeps himself entertained while on his bike tours, and talks about some of the things he thinks about.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTNL6813ArQ?showinfo=0" width="660" height="371" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>Yippie! I Rode My Bicycle To Norway</h3>
<p>It took just over a week to cycle from Copenhagen, Denmark to the border or Sweden and Norway. Darren has spent more than 15 years bicycle touring across dozens of countries all around the world, but he&#8217;s fearful about arriving in Norway, only because of how expensive he heard it was to travel there. Luckily, after a short amount of time, he discovers that Norway isn&#8217;t nearly as bad as everyone has made it out to be.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pa3DdwWXh6I?showinfo=0" width="660" height="371" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<p>During Darren&#8217;s last full day of biking in Norway before meeting his friend Eric Kiraly in Oslo, Norway, he cycled north through a beautiful, green forest region, then camps in the woods for one more night &#8211; picking wild blueberries for dessert.</p>
