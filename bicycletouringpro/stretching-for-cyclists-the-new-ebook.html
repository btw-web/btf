<h1>Stretching For Cyclists</h1>
<p>You asked for it. You got it!</p>
<p>My new book, <a title="Stretching For Cyclists" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/product/stretching-for-cyclists/"><em>Stretching For Cyclists</em></a>, is finally finished&#8230; and you can grab a copy this week only for the super low price of just $4.95 USD (or get it for FREE with your purchase of <a title="The Bicycle Traveler&#039;s Blueprint" href="https://bicycletouringbook.com" class="broken_link"><em>The Bicycle Traveler&#8217;s Blueprint</em></a> (more details below)).</p>
<p><a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/product/stretching-for-cyclists/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-12682" title="Stretching For Cyclists - Book Cover" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2011/10/Stretching-For-Cyclists-Cover-21-588x454.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="509" /></a></p>
<p>As someone who rides a bike, you probably know that you should be stretching your muscles on a regular basis. But I&#8217;m betting you either don&#8217;t stretch often enough, are unsure which muscle groups you really need to be working, or you&#8217;re stretching in a way that is causing pain and damage your body.</p>
<h3>What Can You Expect To Learn From This New Book?</h3>
<p>Even if you are a seasoned cyclist who stretches on a regular basis, the information inside <em>Stretching For Cyclists</em> will help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the tension in your muscles.</li>
<li>Increase your range of motion.</li>
<li>Promote circulation throughout your body.</li>
<li>Prevent common cycling-related injuries, such as muscle strains and tears.</li>
<li>Increase your speed, power and agility on the bike.</li>
<li>And perform at your very best.</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="Stretching For Cyclists - the Ebook" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/product/stretching-for-cyclists/"><em>Stretching For Cyclists</em></a> is a 31-page eBook that not only tells you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why it is so important that you stretch on a regular basis.</li>
<li>The best times of day to stretch.</li>
<li>The proper way to stretch (without hurting yourself or causing damage to your body).</li>
<li>How to stretch your entire body in record setting times.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230; but the book also introduces you to 15 stretches you can perform on a regular basis to help you make the most of your cycling-specific stretching routine.</p>

<h3>Who Helped To Create The Book?</h3>
<p>While I&#8217;d like to take full credit for putting this book together, I have to admit I did have some help.</p>
<p>My father, Dr. Steven Alff, D.C., helped me figure out which cycling-specific stretches to include in the book and provided additional research for the anatomy-based information that can be found throughout the text.</p>
<p>Prior to becoming a Doctor of Chiropractic, Dr. Alff worked as a Corrective Exercise Therapist at the Veteran’s Hospital in Sepulveda, California where he spent much of his time working with spinal-cord injury patients. While at the Veteran&#8217;s Hospital, Dr. Alff designed a stretching and exercise system to be utilized by wheel-chair bound Veterans, which was circulated to all of the Veteran’s Hospitals in the United States. It is no surprise then, that my father was able to help me create the cycling-specific stretching program outlined in <a title="Stretching ebook download page" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/product/stretching-for-cyclists/"><em>Stretching For Cyclists</em></a>.</p>
<p>And who is that beautiful woman on the cover of the book?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my friend Caroline Gleich &#8211; a professional skier, sports model and design consultant. Apart from being a part-time cyclist, Caroline spends most of her time in the outdoors &#8211; either skiing, stand up paddling, trail running, or growing vegetables in her backyard garden.</p>
<p>Caroline not only graces the cover of <em>Stretching For Cyclists</em>, but can be found on 15 additional pages throughout the text. Pages that look a little something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/product/stretching-for-cyclists/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-12684" title="Groin Stretch Page Example" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2011/11/groin-stretch-588x454.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="509" /></a></p>
<h3>Why Did You Write This Book?</h3>
<p>The reason I put this new book together is because readers here at <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> have been asking for it. People just like you have been sending me emails for the past several years and saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do you stretch before your bike rides? If so, what stretches should I be doing?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 300px;"><em>&#8211; Trey Kobler &#8211;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Are there any stretches you recommend I do before I go on my upcoming bicycle tour? I want to make sure I am in shape and prepared for my trip.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 300px;"><em>&#8211; Alan Smithe &#8211;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>You should really think about creating a book for cyclists that is all about stretching. How to stretch properly&#8230; what stretches to conduct&#8230; etc. I know that information is something I need, and I think others would benefit from it as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 300px;"><em>&#8211; James Hammond-</em></p>
</blockquote>
