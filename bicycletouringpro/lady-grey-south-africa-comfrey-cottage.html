<h1>Lady Grey, South Africa &#8211; Comfrey Cottage B&#038;B</h1>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20712" alt="comfrey-cottage-bicycletouringpro" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/05/comfrey-cottage-bicycletouringpro-588x421.jpg" width="588" height="421" /></p>
<p>For a number of different reasons, I excited about finally making it to Lady Grey.</p>
<p>First of all, Lady Grey was what I was calling the half-way point of my bicycle tour in South Africa. Once I reached Lady Grey I was half-way (or more than half-way) between Cape Town and Swaziland/Johannesburg.</p>
<p>Secondly, I had arranged to stay with Grant, one of my <em>BicycleTouringPro.com</em> readers, in Lady Grey&#8230; and he owned a B&amp;B in the city. Even though it had only been two days since I had last had a shower, <a title="cold days of bicycle touring in south africa" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/cycle-touring-in-south-africa-one-week-of-rain/">the cold, wet weather of the last couple days</a> had really taken a toll on my body, clothing and spirits. I couldn&#8217;t wait to take a warm shower and sleep indoors.</p>
<p>More than anything though, I was looking forward to meeting Grant and finally having someone to talk to.</p>
<p>You see, for the first month or so since leaving Cape Town, I had had almost no one to talk to. I had brief conversations with cashiers and hotel reception desk workers, but any conversations I had had were brief and shallow.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m writing this now that my bicycle tour in South Africa has come to an end and I can tell you that this is the thing I missed most while I was in the country &#8211; deep, intelligent conversation with another individual.</p>
<p>After a short, but cold day on the bike, I made it to Lady Grey, found the <a title="Comfrey Cottage B&amp;B in Lady Grey, South Africa" href="http://www.comfreycottage.co.za/" target="_blank">Comfrey Cottage B&amp;B</a> and was quickly introduced to Grant and his parents, both of whom live with him on the Comfrey Cottage estate.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20694" alt="IMG_6728" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/05/IMG_6728-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p>Grant&#8217;s property is beautiful! What was once three or more different properties has been combined into one large estate with multiple buildings, alpacas wandering around munching on the grass, a restaurant/lounge area, and a whole lot more. I had been expecting a small one building B&amp;B in a sleepy South African city, but the Comfrey Cottage B&amp;B was so much more than that.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20675" alt="IMG_6621" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/05/IMG_6621-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20677" alt="IMG_6624" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/05/IMG_6624-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20680" alt="IMG_6625" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/05/IMG_6625-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20681" alt="IMG_6626" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/05/IMG_6626-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p>During my first night in Lady Grey, I showered and got a brief tour of the property. But it was raining, so Grant and I hung out inside most of the time and did a lot of talking (which I was happy about).</p>
<p>Grant is an experienced bicycle traveler himself, and I loved hearing all his stories about bicycle touring in Europe, South Africa and North America. He loves cycle touring so much, he also runs a small online shop where people in South Africa can order bike touring products. His website is: <a title="Cycle Touring South Africa Shop" href="http://www.cycletouring.co.za/" target="_blank">www.cycletouring.co.za</a></p>
<p>Grant also has a number of different bicycles. Some of which are really, really different. I got a kick out of seeing (and driving for myself) his tricycle and his two-person tandem bicycle (which is what his parents tend to ride).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20685" alt="IMG_6640" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/05/IMG_6640-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20682" alt="foldedtrike.jpg" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/05/foldedtrike.jpg-588x882.jpg" width="588" height="882" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20670" alt="elpacabike" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/05/elpacabike-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p>When Grant told me that he rode unicycles as well, I made him bust them out so I could show off my skills. In reality though, I didn&#8217;t do any showing off. Grant is a far better unicyclist than I am. While Grant looked perfectly in control on his unicycle, I was flailing about, just trying to stay upright. It was fun though. Lots of fun!</p>

<p>During my second day in Lady Grey I took a long walk around the city. I jumped a barbed wire fence and climbed to the top of the mountain overlooking the city and got soaking wet on the way back down.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20687" alt="IMG_6668" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/05/IMG_6668-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>

<p>Luckily, by the next morning the rain clouds had disappeared and I was blessed with good weather for the short two-day bike ride to the border of South Africa and Lesotho.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20698" alt="ridingalone.jpg" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/05/ridingalone.jpg-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p>Grant rode with me for the first 45-minutes or so out of town. Then we stopped for a few minutes to take some photos before he turned around and headed back to the B&amp;B while I continued on alone toward the Lesotho border.</p>
