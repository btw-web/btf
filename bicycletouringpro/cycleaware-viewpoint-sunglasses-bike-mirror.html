<h1>My Review of the CycleAware ViewPoint Sunglasses Bicycle Mirror</h1>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1PLFzO0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29996" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2016/01/CycleAware-ViewPoint-Sunglasses-Bicycle-Mirror-Packaging-660x433.jpg" alt="CycleAware ViewPoint Sunglasses Bicycle Mirror Packaging" width="896" height="504" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wearing a bicycle mirror (on and off) since I first started cycling seriously in 2001. I used to use a larger <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/selecting-a-mirror-for-your-bicycle-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helmet-mounted bicycle mirror</a>, I experimented with mirrors mounted to my sunglasses, and even tried a few handlebar-style bike mirrors. But recently, I&#8217;ve been looking for a mirror that doesn&#8217;t take up so much room on my bicycle, or make me look so strange once I step off my bike at the end of the day. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve recently started cycling with the <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1PLFzO0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CycleAware ViewPoint</a></em> &#8211; a super small, adjustable bike mirror that attaches to the inside of my sunglasses and allows me to wear a mirror on my body without anyone ever knowing that I can see behind me.</p>
<p>If you look at the photo below, you&#8217;ll see just how small the <em>CycleAware ViewPoint</em> really is. It&#8217;s incredibly tiny! This is both a good thing and a bad thing!</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1PLFzO0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30057" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2016/01/size-of-cycleaware-viewpoint-sunglasses-bicycle-mirror.jpg-660x417.jpg" alt="cycleaware viewpoint sunglasses bicycle mirror compared to size of hand" width="660" height="417" /></a></p>
<p>The fact that the <a href="http://amzn.to/1PLFzO0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>CycleAware ViewPoint</em></a> is so small and lightweight means it doesn&#8217;t take up any space on my bicycle and is practically hidden from sight when mounted on the inside of my sunglasses. Unless you look super closely, you will have no idea that I&#8217;m riding my bike with a mirror attached to the inside of my shades.</p>
<p>The downside to the mirror being so small is that the view it provides of the road behind me is also quite tiny &#8211; especially when compared with some of the larger, heavier helmet/sunglasses bike mirrors on the market. The mirror is small, so the view it provides you with is also quite minuscule!</p>
<p>In the photo below you can see just how small the <em>CycleAware ViewPoint</em> bicycle mirror is when mounted to the inside of my sunglasses. It&#8217;s incredibly lightweight (I can&#8217;t feel it at all and my sunglasses don&#8217;t tilt to the side or anything) and the mirror does not obstruct my view in the slightest.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1PLFzO0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30055" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2016/01/cycleaware-viewpoint-sunglasses-bicycle-mirror-660x431.jpg" alt="cycleaware viewpoint sunglasses bicycle mirror" width="660" height="431" /></a></p>
<p>You might think that with the <em>CycleAware Viewpoint</em> being mounted in that position on the inside of your sunglasses, it surely obstructs your vision or gets in your way somehow. But I can tell you after extensive use with this mirror, that is certainly not the case. At first, the mirror does appear as a sort of blur in the bottom of your left eye (if you mount the mirror on your left side), but after a while, you learn to look past the mirror while you are riding most of the time, and then only when you need it are you able to glance over at the mirror and see what&#8217;s coming up behind you.</p>
<p>It is a little difficult to get the mirror in position. I had to re-position my <em>ViewPoint</em> mirror about a dozen times before I had it in just the right spot. But once I found the sweet spot, I was able to easily secure the mirror in place and forget about it.</p>
<p>Yes, the <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1PLFzO0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CycleAware Viewpoint</a></em> is probably one of the more difficult bike mirrors on the market today in terms of getting used to how it works. But the advantages to this mirror are huge &#8211; especially if you want to cycle with a mirror, but want to keep your style points and don&#8217;t want anyone to know that you can actually see behind you without having to completely turn your head. With a little practice, you&#8217;ll be able to quickly and easily catch a glimpse of what is coming up behind you on the roadside.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30056" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2016/01/cycleaware-viewpoint-sunglasses-bike-mirror-660x442.jpg" alt="cycleaware viewpoint sunglasses bike mirror" width="660" height="442" /></p>
<p><strong>Just a word of warning:</strong> The <em>CycleAware Viewpoint</em> comes with an extra adhesive &#8211; allowing you to move the mirror around or re-attach the mirror to a different set of sunglasses. Be sure to keep this tiny extra part somewhere safe! You&#8217;re probably going to need it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used the <em>CycleAware Viewpoint</em> in the past and while it does take some getting used to, I think it&#8217;s a good mirror for certain individuals. I, however, lost my previous <em>ViewPoint</em> when the mirror simply fell off of my sunglasses while I was cycling and by the time I realized the mirror was gone, it was too late to go back and try to search for the tiny component laying somewhere on the roadside. My guess is that even with the spare adhesive that comes with the mirror, heat from the sun and sweat from your body will eventually force your <em>Viewpoint</em> to fall from your sunglasses as well. So, if you&#8217;re like me, and you like your <em>ViewPoint</em> bicycle mirror, get it in a position that you like and then glue it to your glasses with a stronger type of adhesive. You won&#8217;t be able easily get the mirror off of your sunglasses once you do this, but you&#8217;ll be able to cycle in peace, knowing that your <em>ViewPoint</em> won&#8217;t so easily fall from your face and be lost forever.</p>
