<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article features winter cycling shoes in both road shoe and mountain biking styles. The waterproof warmth factors are similar in each, but the designs are specific for the shoes use, especially the different clip-less cleat systems.</p>
<p>Mountain bike cleats often use a two-hole system where the cleat is recessed into the bottom of the shoe. Plus, the bottoms of the shoe provide more traction, making this great for mountain biking, of course, but also for types of commuting and touring where you will be on and off the bike, walking for periods at a time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, road cycling shoes have a stiffer sole for more power, getting you from point A to point B in a flash. The cleats often use a three-hole whole system that sticks out from the bottom, making them difficult for walking. These shoes are ideal for commuting or to bring out your inner racer.</p>
