<h3><a title="Radical design cyclone bicycle trailer" href="http://www.radicaldesign.nl/en/products/bicycle-trailers/cyclone/cyclone-iv-chubby" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">Radical Design Cyclone Chubby</a></h3>
<p>Specially designed to travel with the <em>Brompton</em> or another very compact folding bike. This version of the Cyclone bicycle trailer is wider and shorter than the regular Cyclone and has a black &#8220;padded&#8221; bag. The wheels of the Chubby have the same size as the wheels on the <em>Brompton</em>. With the Chubby you can travel by plane, with your <em>Brompton</em> or <em>Airnimal</em> folding bicycle safely stored inside the padded Chubby bag. On arrival, just take out the bike, put your luggage in and connect the Chubby to your bike to have a comfortable travel set-up with up to a 100 liters of storage.</p>

<p>Boasting smart German engineering and excellent build quality, the Monoporter bicycle trailer is a well-thought out single wheel trailer. The whole thing comes to bits and folds up to produce a very compact, convenient pack for transporting. At 25kg its max load is a little low compared to other trailers and I would be a bit concerned about its low slung platform grounding on very rough tracks.</p>
