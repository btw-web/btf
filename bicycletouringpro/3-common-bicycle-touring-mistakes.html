</ul>
<p>In today&#8217;s video lesson I&#8217;m going to be talking about the three biggest mistakes I see first-time bicycle tourists making on their bicycle tours. These are three common mistakes that, if you will make them, will either make your bike tour a whole lot harder than it needs to be, or will prevent you from completing your bike tour as you had planned.</p>
<h2>The 3 Most Common Bicycle Touring Mistakes</h2>
<p>Watch the video at the top of this page and you will discover that the three most common bicycle touring mistakes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/touring-bicycles-buyers-guide/">Not using the right bicycle/equipment</a></li>
<li>Carrying too much gear</li>
<li>Planning to cycle too far each day</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s vitally important that you watch the video at the top of the page if you want to learn more about these three common bicycle touring mistakes &#8211; and most importantly, how to avoid making them yourself.</p>
<h2>My Own Private Bicycle Touring Coach</h2>
<p>One of the ways I was able to avoid making some of these common beginner mistakes when I first started bicycle touring is because of my Uncle Tom.</p>
<p>You see, when I first started bicycle touring at the age of 17, I had never seen anyone else participating in a long-distance bicycle tour. This was pre-<em>YouTube</em> (if you can believe that), so there really was no way to see photos or videos of other people going on bike tours, and there was no major source of information for people like myself who were dreaming of taking a long trip by bike (like there is today with <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em>). Lucky for me, however, I did have one major advantage.</p>
<p>My Uncle Tom has been an outdoor adventurer his entire life. He’s likes to rock climb, go canoeing and boating, and around the same time that I was dreaming of cycling from Oregon to Mexico down the California coastline, he and my aunt Christ had just returned from a two-month-long bike tour in Ireland.</p>
<p>So, my Uncle Tom not only had experience with traveling by bike, but he had all the information I needed to get started! And once I told me Uncle Tom about my plans of traveling by bike down the Pacific Coast of the United States, he happily jumped in to help me.</p>
<p>Without my Uncle Tom’s assistance, there’s very little chance I would have figured out how to pack, plan and prepare for my first bicycle tour. My uncle Tom helped with gear selection, route planning, safety concerns, and a whole lot more. His help was absolutely essential for the success of my first bike tour. Without him, I don’t know if I could have done it on my own.</p>
<p>Sadly, most people in the world who dream of traveling by bicycle don’t have an Uncle Tom to help them plan, prepare for and execute their dream bike tour. Maybe you’ve discovered this for yourself. You want to go bicycle touring, but you don’t really know anyone, personally, who has ever done it. Or you don’t know of anyone who is willing to sit down with you on a one-on-one level and answer any questions that you might have.</p>
<p>After all, that’s what most people really want (and need) when they first start planning for a bicycle tour. They want someone to sit down with them and answer their questions, point out successful bicycle touring techniques, and eliminate and pain for frustration they might experience as a beginner in the world of long-distance cycle touring.</p>
<p>That’s why, in my next video, I’m going to have an offer for you that will catapult you forward toward the bike tour you’ve been dreaming about. <a href="https://www.bicycletouringpro.com/coaching">Something I’ve been working on putting together for the last several months</a>, and something that I think is going to help hundreds of people make the radical life-changes they need to make in order conduct the bike tours they’ve been dreaming about.</p>
<h2>Leave A Comment Below</h2>
<p>Before you leave, please take a moment to share this video with someone you know who might benefit from the information. Then, leave a comment below and let me know on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being the most and 1 being the least), how helpful would it be to YOU if you had someone like me or my Uncle Tom to hold you by the hand, walk you through the entire bicycle touring process, answer any questions you might have, and work with you one-on-one to plan and prepare for your dream bike tour?</p>
<p>Just leave a comment below and let me know, on a scale of 1 to 10, how valuable would it be to have someone like me (or my Uncle Tom) helping you to learn how to conduct the bike tour of your dreams.</p>
