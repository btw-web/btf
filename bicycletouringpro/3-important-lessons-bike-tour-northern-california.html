<p>If you&#8217;ve been following me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bicycletouringpro/" class="broken_link">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bicycletouring/">Facebook</a> recently, you know that I just recently completed a short 5-day bike tour in the mountains of Northern California.</p>
<p>This was a short, but beautiful and challenging bicycle tour with lots of climbing, snow-covered passes, and run-ins with lots of friendly people along the way.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be sharing more photos and videos from my bike tour in Northern California very soon, but for the moment I thought I would share three of the important lessons I learned from this particular cycling adventure with you.</p>
<h2>1. It Takes Some Time To Get Into The Groove</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again. The first few days of a bicycle tour are the most difficult. Even if you&#8217;re an experienced cyclist, it can take as many as three or more days to really get into the groove on a long-distance bike tour.</p>
<p>Many people quit their bike tours during the first three days, when things are at their most difficult. But this is a huge mistake!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t quit when things are at their most difficult. Push through the first three days of your bike tour and I think you&#8217;ll find that your experience on the road will become easier and easier on days four, five and six.</p>
<p>I talk about this in great length inside &#8220;<a href="https://www.bicycletouringpro.com/book">The Bicycle Touring Blueprint</a>.&#8221; You need to go into your bike tour knowing that the first three days are going to likely be some of the most difficult days of the tour&#8230; and if you can just push past those first few days, you&#8217;ll likely get into the groove and the act of riding your bicycle for days, weeks or months on end will ultimately become a whole lot easier.</p>
<h2>2. Bike Touring Is A Mental Game</h2>
<p>Most people think that riding a bicycle for days on end requires an incredible stamina and a toned body. But the truth is, bicycle touring is much more mentally challenging than most people anticipate.</p>
<p>There are going to be moments on your bike tour when you are tired, thirsty, hungry, uncomfortable, in pain or simply want to go home and cry. That&#8217;s normal!</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t want to quit just because you&#8217;re a little inconvenienced. The joy that comes with bicycle touring comes from accomplishing something difficult.</p>
<p>There will be difficult moments on your bike tour, but you&#8217;ll be happy after it&#8217;s all over that you continued on and completed your bike tour as intended.</p>
<p>Bike touring is not 100% physical. It&#8217;s more like 20% physical and 80% mental. Be prepared for that!</p>
<h2>3. Do What You Can To Keep Yourself Safe</h2>
<p>If you saw <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bicycletouring/videos/10155232892677536/">my video on Facebook</a> this week, you already know that when I was on my bike tour in Northern California I kneeled down on the ground and put my knee directly into a poison oak plant, which resulted in a horrible case of poison oak all across my body. This was stupid of me and I should have been paying more attention.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-39704" src="https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bend-Oregon-1442-896x597.jpg" alt="terrible really bad poison oak on knee" width="896" height="597" srcset="https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bend-Oregon-1442-896x597.jpg 896w, https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bend-Oregon-1442-scaled-600x400.jpg 600w, https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bend-Oregon-1442-scaled-900x600.jpg 900w, https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bend-Oregon-1442-300x200.jpg 300w, https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bend-Oregon-1442-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bend-Oregon-1442-1280x853.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px" /></p>
<p>Which is why I want to remind you that when you are bicycle touring, you should do what you can to ensure your personal safety.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to remain safe on the road. Wear bright colors, ride with a bike mirror, know how to properly ride a bicycle in traffic, educate yourself on dangerous animals and/or areas you might be cycling through, etc.</p>
<p>But you should also do what you can to ensure that you arrive home at the end of your bike tour in one piece.</p>
<p>This might mean going super slow on a really steep downhill. This might mean getting off your bike and walking it over a fallen log instead of trying to hop over the log while riding your bike. And this might mean paying to sleep in a hotel for the night instead of trying to endure a cold and windy night in your tent in ill weather.</p>
<p>There are tons of different ways to ensure your safety on a bicycle tour&#8230; but I want to remind you that when you are doing a bike tour and you are far from home, you should take the extra precautions necessary to get you home in one piece.</p>
<p>Be careful out there&#8230; and don&#8217;t make the mistake I made this past week by kneeling down on top of a poisonous plant.</p>
<p>Stay aware of your situation and take the steps necessary to enjoy your bike tour while remaining safe and healthy at the same time.</p>
