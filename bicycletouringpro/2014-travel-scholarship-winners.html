<p>Thank you so very much to each and every person who applied for the 2014 <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> travel scholarship. And special thanks to <a title="Axiom performance gear - bicycle products" href="http://www.axiomgear.com/" target="_blank"><em>Axiom Performance Gear</em></a> for co-sponsoring this year&#8217;s event!</p>
<p><a title="Bicycle Touring Pro travel scholarship" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/scholarship/">The <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> travel scholarship</a>, in case you don&#8217;t know, is a small annual scholarship that has been running here at <em>BicycleTouringPro.com</em> since 2010 and is designed to help first-time bicycle tourists under the age of 30 get their start in the wonderful world of bicycle touring. Since the scholarship&#8217;s inception, thousands of dollars in cash and products have been given away to dozens of individuals from all around the world.</p>
<p>This year there were 96 total applicants from more than 30 different countries all around the world. 73% of the applicants were men and 27% were women (which is an increase in the number of young, female bicycle tourists compared to years&#8217; past).</p>
<h3>Cash &amp; Product Winners</h3>
<p>Of the 96 that applied, there were four applications that really stood out&#8230; so without further adieu, here are the winners of the 2014 <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> travel scholarship:</p>
<div class='content-column one_half'><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-24028" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2014/03/Andei-588x588.jpg" alt="Andei Keough - bicycle traveler in Hawaii" width="588" height="588" /></p>
<p><strong>Andei Keough</strong> &#8211; will be conducting a 4-month-long solo bike tour around Kona, Hawaii. She is a Kundalini yoga instructor and will be teaching on her journey around the island on a donation basis to help her with the upkeep of her food supply and the cost of extra gear. To help her on her travels, Andie has been awarded a set of front and rear <em>Axiom</em> <a title="Axiom waterproof panniers" href="http://www.axiomgear.com/products/gear/bags/randonnee-series/" target="_blank">Randonnee Series panniers</a> and a matching <a title="Axiom handlebar bags" href="http://www.axiomgear.com/products/gear/bags/handlebar-bags/barkeep-dlx-9/" target="_blank">Barkeep DLX 9 handlebar bag.</a> ($420 USD value)</div>
<div class='content-column one_half last_column'><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-24030" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2014/03/timothy-588x588.jpg" alt="Timothy Goutos - scholarship winner" width="588" height="588" /></p>
<p><strong>Timothy Goutos</strong> &#8211; is planning a bicycle tour through Central America &#8211; from San Francisco, California to Panama City, Panama. Following the coastline, Timothy will be climbing volcanoes, exploring ancient pyramids, and trekking through jungles along the way. To help him on his travels, Timothy has been awarded a set of front and rear <a href="http://www.axiomgear.com/products/gear/bags/randonnee-series/" target="_blank"><em>Axiom</em></a> Randonnee Series panniers and a matching <a title="Axiom handlebar bags" href="http://www.axiomgear.com/products/gear/bags/handlebar-bags/barkeep-dlx-9/" target="_blank">Barkeep DLX 9 handlebar bag.</a> ($420 USD value)</p></div><div class='clear_column'></div>

<p><strong>Jake Tveite &amp; Quentin Smith</strong> &#8211; will be conducting a 5,000 mile bike trip together. They will be cycling from Owatonna, MN to San Francisco, CA to Vancouver, British Columbia and then back to their homes in Minnesota. Along the way these two young men will be raising money for <em>Mercy Ships</em>, the largest non-governmental hospital ship in the world. The organization goes to ports along the West coast of Africa and performs necessary surgeries for the African people, for free. Jake and Quentin have been awarded $250 USD to help them on their bike tour.</div>

<strong>Gabriella Scali &amp; Joëlle Tremblay Beaudoin</strong> &#8211; these two young women from Quebec, Canada will be conducting a 2-month-long bicycle tour in Alaska and the Yukon. Gabriella is a skilled photographer and will be capturing the womens&#8217; travels as they go. &#8220;We think that opening yourself to new adventures sucks you out of your comfort zone and makes you see the world with a new and different angle, in order to be a better person.&#8221; Gabriella and Joëlle have been awarded $250 USD to help them on their travels.</div><div class='clear_column'></div>

<h3>Bike Tour Coaching Winners</h3>
<p>In addition to the cash and prizes listed above, I am going to be working with Andie, Timothy, Jake, Quentin, Gabriella and Joëlle in a <a href="http://webinarjam.net/webinar/go/6369/b4a80c9b1f" target="_blank">private online webinar group</a> to help them plan, prepare for, and successfully execute the bicycle tours they have planned. I&#8217;ll be answering whatever questions they might have, working with them to plan safe and enjoyable bicycle touring routes, helping them raise money for their travels, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>Plus, each of these 6 individuals will be receiving the <a title="Bicycle Touring Pro ebooks" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/get-it-all-information-products/"><em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> Get It All Product Package</a> (valued at more than $100 USD) to help them execute the bicycle tour of their dreams.</p>
<p>I will also be donating the Get It All Product Package to the following 15 individuals and inviting them all to participate in the private coaching course I&#8217;ll be conducting with Andie, Timothy, Jake, Quentin, Gabriella and Joëlle.</p>

<p>I selected these 15 individuals because I either saw something special in them or I thought I could help them in some way (either with planning their trip, preparing for life on the road, raising money for their travels, building a website for their bicycle tour, or answering whatever questions they might have about bicycle travel).</p>
<p>All 21 scholarship winners will be participating in a live Internet webinar with me (the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em>) on <strong>Thursday, April 10, 2014</strong>. This is a one-time-only bicycle touring event that will be free for the 21 people listed on this page, but if you would like to join this unique webinar and learn how to successfully plan, prepare for, or execute your first trip by bike, you can do so by simply <a href="http://webinarjam.net/webinar/go/6369/ff84509e2c" target="_blank">registering for the webinar on this page</a>.</p>
Register For The Webinar
<p>The webinar on Thursday, April 10th will be conducted at 12 PM Pacific Standard Time and will be approximately 1-hour long. During the first half-hour or so I will be talking about some of the things you need to know before going off on your first bicycle tour (such as what to pack, how to physically prepare, and what to mentally expect once you hit the road)&#8230; and then after I finish talking I will open it up for questions and answers. This will be your opportunity to ask me anything you want about conducting your own bicycle touring adventures. The webinar should last at least one hour, but may go a bit longer than that if there are lots of questions to answer.</p>
