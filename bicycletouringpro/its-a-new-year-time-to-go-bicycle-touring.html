<p>We&#8217;re launching the online version of <em>GoBicycleTouring</em> today, but later this year we&#8217;ll be releasing a digital and in-print version of the <em>GoBicycleTouring.com</em> content, so you&#8217;ll be able to search for awesome guided and self-guided bicycle tours on your computer, tablet, smart phone or in good old-fashioned paperback format.</p>
<h3>What Exactly Is A Guided Bicycle Tour?</h3>
<p>A guided bicycle tour is a trip by bike in which you cycle on a predesignated route and are escorted on a daily basis by an experienced bicycle touring guide.</p>
<p>Bicycle tours of this type can last anywhere from a couple hours to several weeks or months at a time. Most guided bike tours, however, are anywhere from 1 to 10 days in length, with the average guided bike touring being about 4-7 days.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of guided bicycle tour you might sign up for, your gear (such as your food, clothing, toiletries, etc.) might be carried in a vehicle that meets you at various checkpoints along your route. Other times, you&#8217;ll be led by an experienced bicycle touring guide, but everything you need for the tour will be carried with you on your bicycle.</p>
<h3>Then What Exactly Is A Self-Guided Bicycle Tour?</h3>
<p>A self-guided bicycle tour is like a guided bicycle tour in that you will be cycling along a designated route with most or all of your food and lodging along the way taken care of for you. The major difference, however, is that on a self-guided bicycle tour, you don&#8217;t have a guide from a touring company traveling with you, so you are free to travel at your own speed, choose your own company and make whatever alterations to the itinerary you might wish to make.</p>
<p>At <em>GoBicycleTouring.com</em>, you will find an assortment of 1-day/multi-day guided and self-guided bicycle tours. Each tour is a little different from the others, so be sure to do your research and find out what is or is not included in your guided and self-guided bicycle tours before booking your experience.</p>
