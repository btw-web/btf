<h1>My 3 Favorite Films About Bicycle Touring</h1>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in bike travel and you&#8217;d like to get some inspiration for your own bicycle touring adventures, one of the best ways to do that is to watch one or more bicycle touring films.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m going to share three of my favorite feature-length films about bicycle touring with you&#8230; and then I&#8217;ll share 2 shorter videos with you about my own bicycle touring adventures in <a title="Switzerland biking info" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/?s=Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and <a title="south africa biking information" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/?s=South+Africa">South Africa</a>.</p>
<h3>#3) EAT. SLEEP. SURF.</h3>
<p>Rian Cope and Dylan Brayshaw were two ordinary 20-somethings from Australia, working normals jobs, and living relatively normal lives. But in the year 2009, these two young men gave it all up to cycle across Indonesia and surf at some of the best surf spots in the world. While cycling, surfing, and discovering a whole lot about themselves and the people of Indonesia, Rian and Dylan shot a ton of video footage, which was later turned into a 4-part documentary series titled, &#8220;<a title="eat sleep surf tv show" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/eat-sleep-surf-bicycle-surfing-indoensia-documentary/">Eat. Sleep. Surf.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="eat sleep surf documentary" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/eat-sleep-surf-bicycle-surfing-indoensia-documentary/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-27155" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2014/10/IMG_4167-660x450.jpg" alt="Dylan Brayshaw and Rian Cope of EAT SLEEP SURF" width="660" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>Dylan recently finished another bicycle/surfing movie called SENDIRI, which I recently reviewed on the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> website. <a title="Sendiri bicycle surfing movie" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/sendiri-bicycle-surfing-movie/">Click here to watch the trailer and read my full movie review</a>.</p>
<h3>#2) JANAPAR: LOVE ON A BIKE</h3>
<p><a title="Janapar bicycle touring documentary" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/janapar-love-on-a-bike-movie-review/">Janapar: Love on a Bike</a> is the title of Tom Allen&#8217;s 110-minute movie about his bicycle tour around the world and the love he found along the way. The word &#8220;janapar&#8221; comes from the Armenian word for &#8220;journey&#8221; and is the perfect word to describe Tom Allen&#8217;s transformation from the inexperienced and headstrong, young boy we are introduced to at the beginning of the film&#8230; to the weathered, worldly and caring young man we discover at the film&#8217;s conclusion.</p>
<p><a title="Janapar" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/janapar-love-on-a-bike-movie-review/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-23388" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2014/02/janapar.jpg" alt="janapar movie about bicycle touring" width="660" height="371" /></a></p>
<p>Janapar: Love on a Bike is not just a movie made for people who love bicycle touring, but is a story that anyone who has ever been in love, or has hoped to be in love, can relate to.</p>
<h3>#1) ONE MILE ABOVE</h3>
<p><a title="One Mile Above bike touring movie" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/one-mile-above-movie/">One Mile Above</a> is the story of a young, 24-year-old Taiwanese man named Shuhao who, after his brother dies in an accident, takes it upon himself to cycle from Taiwan to the highest point in Tibet, and complete the bicycle touring journey his brother had always dreamed of taking while he was alive.</p>
<p>Along the way, Shuhao not only learns how to ride a bicycle, but encounters a whole host of challenging obstacles along the way &#8211; such as freezing cold weather, steep mountain terrain, ferocious wild animals, and an accident on a high mountain pass that leaves him and his cycling partner literally hanging on for the lives.</p>
<p><a title="one mile above film" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/one-mile-above-movie/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-23581" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2014/02/One-Mile-Above-660x440.jpg" alt="One Mile Above bicycle touring film in Tibet" width="660" height="440" /></a></p>
