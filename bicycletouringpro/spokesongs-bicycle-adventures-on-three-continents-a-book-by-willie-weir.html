<h1>Spokesongs: Bicycle Adventures On Three Continents &#8211; A Book By Willie Weir</h1>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1654 alignleft" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border: 1px solid black;" title="spokesongs-willie-weir1" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2009/03/spokesongs-willie-weir1.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="383" />You&#8217;ve probably heard of Willie Weir. In fact, if you&#8217;ve ever read a copy of <a title="adventure cyclist" href="http://www.adventurecycling.org/mag/index.cfm"><em>Adventure Cyclist</em></a> magazine, you&#8217;ve likely seen his work. He&#8217;s funny, an imaginative storyteller, and a wild and wacky character. But his book “<a title="Spokesongs - by willie weir" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1891369172?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=farviewpoint-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1891369172">Spokesongs&#8221;</a>, sadly, isn&#8217;t any of those things. I love Willie, but <em>Spokesongs </em>left me sorely disappointed.</p>
<p>First of all, the book is a huge 256-page hardback. It weighs about a pound and was obviously not created with the traveler in mind. It doesn&#8217;t easily fit inside a backpack or a set of panniers. The publisher apparently forgot that some people might actually want to read the book while doing some traveling of their own. Never before have I seen a travel book so ill-designed for its intended audience.</p>
<p>But then I started reading. The text was large and the chapters were short – most of them just a couple pages in length. There was some obvious padding going on here.</p>
<p>The stories were good, but not great. As Willie admits at the beginning of the text, most of the stories come from pre-published articles he had written for other publications. And because the stories are scattered about from three different bicycle tours, the whole book comes across as disjointed and boring.</p>
<p>Maps showing where each story is taking place in the world attempt to string the stories together, but I found myself ignoring the maps altogether as they provided little, if any, assistance in following Willie&#8217;s adventures.</p>
<p>While a few of the stories throughout &#8220;Spokesongs&#8221; were funny, enlightening, or encouraging, the book as a whole is just plain forgettable.</p>
<p>Three hours after starting the text I reached the last page. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever read such a gigantically sized book in such a short time. And frankly, I wasn&#8217;t sad that the journey was over. I was happy to shed a pound of paper from my panniers&#8230; and I was ready to get back to my travels and start creating some “spokesongs” of my own.</p>
