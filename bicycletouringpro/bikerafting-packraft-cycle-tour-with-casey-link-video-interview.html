<h1>This Guy Has Been Using A Bicycle And A Packraft To Travel Across Europe For More Than Two Years</h1>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26104" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2014/09/casey-link-bikerafting-travel.jpg" alt="bikerafting with a touring bicycle and packraft" width="660" height="264" /></p>
<p>27-year-old <a title="Casey Link website" href="http://onvagrancy.com/" target="_blank">Casey Link</a> is traveling across Europe on a bicycle with an inflatable packraft attached to his rear rack. When he runs into a road, Casey packs up his bicycle, deflates his raft, and straps all of his earthly possessions onto the back of his bike. But when Casey reaches a river or lake, he can quickly inflate his packraft, pack his bicycle onto the small boat, and float away in the water.</p>
<p>For the last two years, Casey Link has been slowly making his way across Europe in this manner. Watch the video below to hear Casey discuss his bike touring and packrafting expedition with Darren Alff of <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em>.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GsMdFv546kQ" width="660" height="371" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Casey Link met up with Darren Alff of <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> in Sibiu, Romania, which is where this video interview was conducted. The video is a recording of a live Internet web event that took place on Sunday, September 14th, 2014.</p>
<h3>Details About Casey&#8217;s Boat &amp; Bicycle:</h3>
<p>Casey is traveling with a an <a title="Alpaca Explorer 42 packraft" href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Packrafts/Alpacka-Raft-Explorer-42-without-spraydeck::466.html?language=en" target="_blank">Explorer 42 packraft, made by a company called <em>Alpacka</em></a>. The raft is a two-person packraft designed for single-bladed canoe style paddling or for a single- person carrying a large load (like a fully-loaded touring bike).</p>
<p>The Explorer 42 packraft that Casey is using weights about 2.6 kg (5.7 lbs), but the seats add about 150 grams each, bringing the total weight of the raft (minus the paddle, floatation device, etc.) to about approximately 3.1 kg (6.8 lbs).</p>
<p>The paddle Casey is using is a <a title="folding packraft paddle" href="http://www.packrafting-store.de/Paddle/Special-paddle/Shearwater-Webbed-Paddle::510.html" target="_blank">collapsible webbed paddle</a> made of fiberglass and carbon fiber. It is a 4-piece paddle, meaning the blades make two pieces and the pole itself splits into two pieces as well. The blade collapses to a packed width of only 2.7 inches, so it is much easier to fit on a touring bike. The weight is 1 kg. It works best in flat water &#8211; not wild water.</p>
<p>Finally, Casey is using riding a <a title="Surly Long Haul Trucker review" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/surly-long-haul-trucker-touring-bicycle-review/"><em>Surly</em> Long Haul Trucker</a> Deluxe with <em>Ortlieb</em> roller classic panniers and Tubus racks. The Deluxe model of the <em>Surly</em> LHT touring bicycle comes with S&amp;S couplers that allow Casey to split his bicycle frame in half, which is not only useful when packing his bike inside his packraft, but also when flying with the bicycle or traveling with it on boats, buses or trains. When asked whether the S&amp;S couplers on his touring bicycle were necessary for the type of bikerafting expedition that he is undertaking, Case replied by saying that, &#8220;Fitting the bike and gear onto the packraft wouldn&#8217;t be feasible without the couplers.&#8221;</p>
