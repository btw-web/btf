<h1>Bicycle Touring Pro Turns 3!</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Three years ago I got a call from one of my old college roommates saying that after years of seeing me go off on my own bicycle touring adventures, he finally wanted to try going on a bike trip of his own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We spoke on the phone for hours that night and I passionately filled him in on all the lessons I had learned about bike travel over the years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When our conversation ended late that evening, I sat down and thought to myself, &#8220;If I can help one person plan and prepare for their first bicycle touring adventure by simply speaking to them over the phone, I wonder how many people I could help if I were to write down everything I know about bicycle touring and post it all on the Internet?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two days later, <em>BicycleTouringPro.com </em>was born!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8742" style="border: 0pt none; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;" title="Bicycle Touring Pro" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/10/bicycle-touring-pro-octob.jpg" alt="What BicycleTouringPro.com looked like in October 2010" width="220" height="533" />On October 27th, 2007 I published <a title="first blog post" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/welcome-to-bicycletouringprocom/">a short article</a> about my plans for the future of this site &#8230; and that moment marked the beginning of it all. It was the birth of <em>Bicycle Touring Pro.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Three years has since gone by, but it feels like it all happened just yesterday. And even though I&#8217;ve put in thousands of hours worth of work into this website, I have had so much fun working on the site that those countless hours slaving in front of my computer feel like mere minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In three year&#8217;s time, <em>BicycleTouringPro.com </em>has grown from a tiny self-coded website that only my parents and best friends would occasionally glance at&#8230; to a global enterprise with more than 30,000 monthly readers in countries all over the world. Add onto this the growing communities being built around the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro </em><a title="Bicycle TOuring Pro - Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/bicycletouring" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a title="bicycle touring pro twitter account" href="http://twitter.com/bicycletouring" target="_blank">Twitter </a>and <a title="YouTube bicycle touring videos" href="http://www.youtube.com/bicycletouringpro" target="_blank">YouTube</a> sites and the overall readership here at <em>BicycleTouringPro.com </em>has literally grown by leaps and bounds!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For an activity as niche as &#8220;bicycle touring&#8221;, I sure have had a lot to say about the subject over the past three years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since starting this website I&#8217;ve written an astounding 461 free articles, created <a title="travel videos" href="http://www.youtube.com/bicycletouringpro" target="_blank">68 travel related videos</a>, taken <a title="Darren Alff travel photos" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/darrenalff/" target="_blank">thousands of photos</a> and answered countless emails from new and experienced bicycle tourists in locations across the globe. And that&#8217;s not all!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve also created three popular ebooks designed to help first-time bicycle traveler&#8217;s get their start (<a title="touring bicycles" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/touring-bicycles-buyers-guide/" target="_blank">The Essential Guide To Touring Bicycles</a>&#8230; <a title="bicycle touring how to book" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/the-bicycle-travelers-blueprint/" target="_blank">The Bicycle Traveler&#8217;s Blueprint</a>&#8230; and <a title="travel accomodations" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/traveling-cyclists-guide-to-free-hotels-campgrounds/" target="_blank">The Ultimate Guide To Free Lodging</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And just this past year I launched the <a title="bicycle travel network" href="http://bicycletravelnetwork.com/2010/05/2010-bicycle-travel-network-scholarship-recipients/" target="_blank">Bicycle Travel Network</a> (an organization that gives micro-scholarships to young bike travelers) and created a feature-length <a title="cycle touring how to movie" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/movie/" target="_blank">instructional video</a> designed to help first-time bicycle tourists get their start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In between all of this writing, shooting, editing, etc. I&#8217;ve traveled to dozens of countries around the world and added thousands of miles to my personal bicycle touring odometer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I look back at everything I&#8217;ve accomplished in the last three years, I&#8217;m pretty amazed at how I&#8217;ve been able to keep it all up and still remain so incredible passionate about what it is that I am doing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;If you want to do something in your life and you&#8217;re passionate about doing it&#8230; there&#8217;s little that can stop you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&#8217;s the approach I&#8217;ve taken with my work here at <em>Bicycle Touring Pro </em>over the past three years and I think it&#8217;s an approach that&#8217;s finally paying off.  Nearly every day I get an email or two from some person somewhere in the world telling me just how much they&#8217;ve learned from <em>Bicycle Touring Pro </em>and how much they love the community that has be created here. It is <a title="reader testimonials" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/testimonials-from-bicycletouringprocom-readers/" target="_blank">these messages</a> that make me want to continue my work here and keep on helping others learn about the joys of traveling by bike.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In regards to the future, there&#8217;s a lot more in store for <em>Bicycle Touring Pro </em>in the moths ahead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a personal front, I plan to leave for Peru in just over one month&#8217;s time. My plan once I&#8217;m there is to travel about in South America for six full months and all the while share my adventures with you here on the website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m also working on a short book about my bicycle touring experiences in the United States of America and I plan to release that text sometime in the next several weeks. Best of all, I&#8217;m going to give the book away for free!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And today I&#8217;m launching a new website called <a title="Motorcycle Touring Pro" href="http://www.motorcycletouringpro.com/" target="_blank"><em>Motorcycle Touring Pro</em></a>. Just like this website which concentrates on bicycle travel, <em>Motorcycle Touring Pro </em>is going to be a website for those wishing to travel long distances on a motorbike.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to all this, I&#8217;ve got a number of other projects in the works&#8230; but I think I&#8217;m going to hold off and tell you about those projects a little bit later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see, a lot has changed over the past three years. <em>Bicycle Touring Pro </em>is growing, the readership is at an all-time high, and more and more people are experiencing the joys of bicycle travel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to take this moment and thank you for being a part of the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro </em>community. Without you this website would not be what it is&#8230; and without your kind messages, I might not have the motivation needed to continue working to make this site better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks again&#8230; and here&#8217;s to another great year at <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em>!</p>
