<h1>Do Not Buy The Nikon Coolpix S4000 Digital Camera</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A couple weeks ago <a title="video camera for travelers" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/video-cameras-editing-software/">I wrote an article</a> about the new digital camera (a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034XFG1S?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=farviewpoint-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0034XFG1S" target="_blank">Nikon Coolpix S4000</a>) and video editing software (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YQ72IC?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=farviewpoint-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001YQ72IC" target="_blank">Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD</a>) I purchased for my upcoming trip to South America. At the time, I was super excited about my new camera and its HD video capabilities. Unfortunately, my excitement for the Nikon Coolpix was very short lived.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/video-cameras-editing-software/"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-8530" style="border: 0pt none;" title="nikon coolpix-camera" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/10/coolpix-camera1.jpg" alt="nikon coolpix s4000 digital camera" width="474" height="293" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During my first week with the camera, I took a drive out to <a title="Dinosaur National monument motorcycle tour" href="http://www.motorcycletouringpro.com/dinosaur-national-monument-day-2/" target="_blank">Dinosaur National Monument</a> on my motorcycle. While there, I snapped a couple dozen photos&#8230; and that&#8217;s where the trouble began.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After taking about 20 photos with my brand new camera, every once and a while I would get a &#8220;lens error&#8221; whenever I tried to zoom in. I didn&#8217;t think much of this at the time, as I figured it was just a rare incident. However, when I got home from my trip and went to watch some of the videos I had shot while I was in the Park, I realized that the microphone on my new camera was totally not working! The sound on all of the videos I had shot was completely not there. All I could hear was a loud buzzing sound coming from the camera.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; I thought to myself. &#8220;I just bought the worst camera ever.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After discovering that the microphone on my new camera was totally not working, I ran to my pile of recent paperwork and pulled out the <em>Best Buy </em>receipt I had obtained when I purchased the camera. Unfortunately, I was three days out of the two-week warranty period. Nevertheless, I rode my bike over to the <em>Best Buy </em>electronics store where I had purchased the camera and told them about my problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After about an hour, the good people at <em>Best Buy </em>gave me another camera (even though I was technically out of the warranty period). (At this point, I didn&#8217;t think there was anything wrong with the Nikon Coolpix as a whole. I just thought that I had received a dud the first time around.) So, <em>Best Buy </em>gave me another Nikon Coolpix and I happily took it home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But then, exactly two weeks later, I opened the camera and heard a loud popping sound come from the lens &#8211; not a good sound to be coming from a brand new digital camera.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;This is not good,&#8221; I thought to myself again. &#8220;I need this camera to work for 6 months or more while I travel through South America&#8230; and I can&#8217;t even get it to work for more than two weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wasn&#8217;t sure what the loud popping sound was that I had heard when I turned on the camera, but I didn&#8217;t care. I instantly grabbed the camera and returned to <em>Best Buy</em>, this time asking for a complete refund &#8211; no exchanges, no store credit, nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, the people at <em>Best Buy </em>tried to get me to buy something else, but I wasn&#8217;t going to do it. I did have to pay a $24 re-stocking fee to return the camera, but I was happy to have gotten rid of the camera and gotten back most of the money I spent on this glorious piece of $%#*.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, now I&#8217;m back to square one. I had wanted to find a digital point and shoot camera that not only took great still photos, but also shot excellent HD video. I thought the <a title="Nikon Coolpix s4000" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034XFG1S?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=farviewpoint-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0034XFG1S" target="_blank">Nikon Coolpix S4000</a> was going to work for me, but it certainly did not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you travel with a camera, you need something that is not only functional, but that can handle the demands of being on the road. The Nikon Coolpix S4000 is certainly not that kind of camera. In less than 4 weeks with 2 different cameras in my possession, I managed to take less than 100 photos before both items were eventually returned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are thinking about purchasing the Nikon Coolpix S4000, I urge you to reconsider. The camera looks nice and has some features that sounds pretty cool, but ultimately, the S4000 is a total waste of money.</p>
