<h1>Thru-Hiking Park City, Utah’s Wasatch Crest Trail</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bicycle touring is a lot like backpacking&#8230; except that on a bike trip the weight of your gear is placed on your bicycle instead of your body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a recent short two-day backpacking trip near my home in Park City, Utah, I&#8217;ve been reminded of just how nice it can be to travel with a bike.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7607" title="backpacking packing list" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/07/IMG_5072-588x392.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="440" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;s the deal: I moved to Park City, Utah in early 2006 and since that time have wanted to hike the Wasatch Crest Trail from one end to the other. Over the years I&#8217;ve just never made the time to hike the trail, but a few days ago I decided just to go for it. No training. No planning. Nothing. I just woke up one morning and threw my camping gear and some food and water into a backpack and took off for the trail at the northern end of town. The goal was to walk for two-days straight &#8211; covering a distance of approximately 30 miles on a trail that runs from one side of Park City to the other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before I even hit the trail I knew that it was going to be a long and sweaty hike. It was more than 90 degrees outside, I was carrying about 5 liters of water (because I knew it would be at least two days before I would have a chance to refill my water bottles) and I was carrying a lot of unnecessary gear (i.e. SLR camera, two reading books, way too much food, etc.). Nevertheless, I pushed on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first part of the hike was the worst. It was all uphill for hours on end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I started hiking in the part of town known as Pinebrook, which sits at an elevation of approximately 7,000 feet. Several hours later, I was at an elevation near 10,000 feet&#8230; and I was standing on top of The Canyons Ski Resort &#8211; the same ski resort that I skied at all winter long.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7610" title="Darren Alff - the backpacker" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/10/IMG_7932-588x441.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="495" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the first part of the hike, I didn&#8217;t see a soul. But as soon as I reached the trail that lead through The Canyons, I was instantly bombarded with a stream of mountain bikers. Unlike myself (I had walked up to the top of the mountain), the mountain bikers were riding up the mountain on the ski resort&#8217;s gondola. After hiking for so many hours, I hated seeing those mountain bikers zipping around with such ease. They made me wish I has traveling by bike and not on foot. They were so incredibly fast&#8230; and I was so incredibly slow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the time I reached the top of The Canyons my hips were getting really sore. The weight of my pack was taking a toll on my body and my feet were getting really sore. But I pressed on and just kept walking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once I reached the top of The Canyons Ski Resort, the trail turned left and ran for several miles along the ridge-line, thus it&#8217;s name &#8211; the Wasatch CREST trail. Hiking at the top of the mountain was so much better than hiking to its peak&#8230; and the views were a whole lot better as well. To my left I could see all of Park City &#8211; my home! And to the right I could see Salt Lake City and the numerous ski resorts that run down the other side of the mountain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hiked for another couple hours along the Crest trail before it started to get dark. At around 8PM, I decided it was time to find a place to spend the night, and knew that I needed to find a place that was flat so I could lay out my tent and get a good night&#8217;s sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luckily, I was able to hike up just a short distance from the trail and instantly find a flat spot at the very top of the mountain. On one side of the tent was Park City and on the other side was Salt Lake City. I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better place to camp.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After setting up my tent, I changed my clothes, ate some food and then rolled inside my sleeping bag and instantly fell asleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7611" title="camping in park city, utah" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/10/IMG_7948-588x441.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="495" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, at around 11 PM, I woke up. My legs were cramping and they had woken me from my slumber. I tried stretching them out, massaging them, and doing everything I could to get them out of my mind, but the pain was really bothering me and I couldn&#8217;t get back to sleep for several hours. So I just laid there in my tent, listening to the wind blow up the mountain and doing everything in my power to go back to sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did eventually get back to sleep (thank goodness) and woke the next morning around 8 AM.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I quickly packed up my tent, threw on my backpack and strolled back down the mountain to the trail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For several more hours I hiked along the ridge-line, but quickly realized that I wasn&#8217;t going to make it all the way to the southern end of the trail. It was just too hot outside and I didn&#8217;t have enough water. By the time I reached Park City Mountain Resort, I knew that my hike was nearly over. I had half a water bottle left and knew that that would only last me another hour or two. So, I had to make a decision. I could continue hiking along the Wasatch Crest Trail for a few more miles and finish the hike as intended, but risk running out water and getting myself into serious trouble&#8230; or I could quit now and hike down through Park City Mountain Resort and be back in town in about two hours time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I decided that with the heat the way it was and my water being so low, it would be best if I simply hiked down the mountain right away. So that&#8217;s exactly what I did.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hiked down one of the trails that runs through Park City Mountain Resort, past a bunch of the old silver mining buildings that remain there, and eventually returned to downtown Park City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7612" title="park city california mine" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/10/IMG_5243-588x392.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="439" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once in town, I jumped on the city bus and rode it all the way back to my condo. Once there, I instantly took off my shoes (boy were they sore) and took a long, cold shower. I then collapsed on the couch and spent the entire evening watching movies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, the hike as a whole was a good one. It was something I had wanted to do for a very long time and I was glad that I finally had a chance to do it. Plus, I got to experience an incredible night of camping, perched on a mountain top at nearly 10,000 feet elevation with views of Utah you would not believe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My only mistake was that I packed too much gear and too little water. If I were to hike trail again, I&#8217;d do it in a single day, wear better shoes, and pack nothing but my camera and a whole lot of water.</p>
