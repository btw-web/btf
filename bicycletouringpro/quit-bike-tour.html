<h1>Why I Quit My Bike Tour</h1>

<p>After completing my recent <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/2016-portugal-spain-norway-bike-tour/">2016 bike tour</a> across Portugal, Spain, France, Andorra, Norway and Sweden, I flew back to the United States and some have you have been asking, &#8220;Darren, why did you quit your bike after only three months?&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, many of my previous bicycle touring expeditions have been much longer. Seven months, nine months, fourteen months&#8230; and sometimes even longer! This year, however, my bike tour in Europe was only three months long. Why was that? And did something go wrong?</p>
<p>No, nothing went wrong. The plan from the beginning was to travel for only three months. If you re-read my <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/join-my-friends-kevin-ryan-ebba-on-a-bike-tour-in-europe-this-summer/">2016 bike tour travel plans post</a>&#8230; or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D-2BbTVWmA">watch the video I published back at the beginning of May</a>, you will see that I planned on traveling for only three months this year before returning home to the United States.</p>
<p>The reason my trip was so short this year is because in late 2015, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer. One week after receiving this news, I went in for an emergency surgery and it took me several months after that to recover &#8211; not just physically, but mentally as well.</p>
<p>One of the main things that got me through this terrible experience was planning and preparing for my next big bike tour (the bike tour that I just completed). In fact, I always find the planning and preparation process of a bike tour to be extremely motivating. It gives you something to look forward to&#8230; and it&#8217;s fun to dream about the adventures you might have along the way.</p>
<p>So, I spent the first several months of 2015 recovering from my surgery and preparing my body and my mind for another big bike tour in Europe.</p>
<p>But unlike my bike tours in the past, I knew that this bike tour was going to be different. Not only had a just recently undergone a pretty major surgery, but my doctors were telling me that I would need to receive regular 3-month checkups in order to make sure the cancer was truly gone&#8230; and that it had not spread to other parts of my body. Every three months I would need to return to Southern California (where I had my surgery and where all of my doctors were located) and get new blood tests, a new CT scan, and visit with each of my various doctors.</p>
<p>So, when I was planning my bike tour in Europe this year, I knew that I was on a tight three-month timeline. I had 90 days to fly to Europe, do as much cycling as I possibly could do, and then I would need to fly back to the United States for a new round of tests and follow-up doctor visits.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why my bike tour was only three months long this year&#8230; and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m back in Southern California at the moment.</p>
<p>I plan to stay here in SoCal for another 2-3 months, but after that I&#8217;m hoping to go off on another 3-month-long bicycle touring adventure. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml93lvllLNg">Watch the video above</a> and you&#8217;ll learn that I have not yet decided where I want to go on my next cycling adventure, but I am debating between three very different places: Cyprus, Ecuador and Iran.</p>
<p><em>Which of these three destinations would you be most interested in cycling through? Leave a comment below and let me where you think I should go.</em></p>
<p>PS &#8211; Thank you to everyone who has messaged me privately or left comments on my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bicycletouringpro/videos">YouTube videos</a> and/or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bicycletouring">Facebook posts</a>.
