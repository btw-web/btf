<h1>Cycle Touring In South Africa: One Week Of Rain</h1>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20656" alt="DCIM100GOPRO" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/05/GOPR1772-588x441.jpg" width="588" height="441" /></p>
<p>I was already in a bad mood because of the news I received from back home about the people renting my condo bailing on me at the last moment. I had been in a bad mood about this for about a week now. So when the weather turned sour and I had to continue cycling east, I wasn&#8217;t in the best of spirits. However, it was just a short 2-day bike ride from Burgersdorp to Lady Grey, South Africa &#8211; my next destination. So I sucked it up and cycled east.</p>
<p>In the city of Aliwal North I stopped to get some bananas and water at a corner market and gave a few bananas to the young boy who &#8220;watched my bicycle&#8221; while I was inside the shop. I normally don&#8217;t give anything to these people, but because there was no one else around, I gave the boy some of my food. He seemed happy with that&#8230; and so was I.</p>
<p>Then I spent the night camping about 10 kilometers east of the city, behind a barbed wire fence, in a cow pasture near a large country estate. It rained all night, it was extremely cold, and even though I was only on the road for two days between Burgersdorp and Lady Grey, it felt like an entire week.</p>
