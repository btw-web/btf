<p><strong>Please tell me where you went on your bicycle tour and how many days you were on the road.</strong></p>
<p>I started in Cabo de Sao Vicente and I cycled to Warsaw, Poland. After that I went to  Romania (Sibiu). I was on the bike for 18 days and covered approximately 5,800 km during this time. It was amazing!</p>
<p><strong>Did you have any fears when you first started planning your bicycle tour?</strong></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have any fears myself, but my family was concerned about me, so that wasn&#8217;t so easy for them.</p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite moment from your bicycle tour?</strong></p>
<p>When I saw the shooting stars in Sierra Central and when I proved to myself that I can cycle further and further every time.</p>
<p><strong>What was the biggest mistake you made during your bike tour?</strong></p>
<p>I hope this is advice to everyone who reads this: Never go on a tour with a road bike pulling a trailer! It&#8217;s hard and if you have too much weight on your trailer you will have problems. (Note from Darren: This is why it is so important that you use the right type of bicycle on your tours. I cover this in great detail inside <a title="Touring Bicycle Book" href="http://www.touringbicyclebook.com">The Essential Guide To Touring Bicycles</a>. Read it!)</p>
<p><strong>What else did you learn from your bicycle?</strong></p>
<p>Try to drink a lot of energy boosters when you cycle in hot places.</p>
<p>Learn a little bit of the local language before you start your trip (English it isn&#8217;t so common everywhere in the world).</p>
<p>Try to eat a lot because you burn twice as much on a bicycle tour as you would during your normal training days.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think you&#8217;ll conduct more bicycle tours in the future? If so, where do you want to go? And why do you want to go there?</strong></p>
<p>YES!!!!!! Next year I want to go from Norway to Sicilien over Gottgart. After that I want to cycle through the Sahara desert. Why ? Because I can and I want to prove to myself that I can do it.</p>
