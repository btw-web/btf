<h1>Hiking To Devil&#8217;s Peak in Cape Town, South Africa</h1>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20315" alt="maid.jpg" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/04/maid.jpg-588x882.jpg" width="588" height="882" /></p>
<p><a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/my-tiny-house-in-observatory-cape-town-south-africa/">My tiny house in Cape Town</a> came with a house cleaner named Monica who would come once a week to clean the property, wash her own family&#8217;s clothes in the washing machine, and eat her lunch. Her coming to the house, meant that I needed to leave&#8230; so I used Monica as an excuse to get outside and climb to the top of Devil&#8217;s Peak, hike across Table mountain, wander down into the streets of downtown Cape Town, stroll through the V&amp;A Waterfront, and then return to my little house at some time in the afternoon after Monica had finally left.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the day Monica came over, it was extremely overcast and windy at the top of Devil&#8217;s Peak.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20293" alt="IMG_4618" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4618-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p>At the bottom of the trail leading up to the peak I met Andrew and ________, who invited me to join them on their climb up the mountain.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20308" alt="hikingfriends.jpg" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/04/hikingfriends.jpg-588x882.jpg" width="588" height="882" /></p>
<p>I left my new friends behind once we reached the summit of Devil&#8217;s Peak. They went back the same way we came&#8230; and I continued hiking across Table Mountain, over to where the cable car brings tourists up and down the hillside.</p>

<p>Once I reached the Table Mountain cable car, I then hiked down into the city bowl &#8211; the downtown center of Cape Town.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20302" alt="IMG_4731" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4731-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>

<p><a title="Anna Bu" href="http://www.butherightthing.com/" target="_blank">Anna Bu</a> suggested I get a sandwich at a tiny Long Street cafe called &#8220;Yourstruly&#8221; and an avacado-mint milkshake at the &#8220;Royale Eatery&#8221;&#8230; so I did exactly that. The milkshake was my favorite. It was really, really good.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20320" alt="IMG_4734" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4734-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20312" alt="IMG_4793" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4793-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p>As I continued walking across town, I came across this Polish bicycle traveler. When he stopped playing his song, I approached him and in Polish tried to introduce myself. But he totally ignored me! Instead, he pointed at a sign he had attached to his bicycle in which he was asking for money. &#8220;What a jerk!&#8221; I thought to myself as I walked off in the opposite direction.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20313" alt="IMG_4798" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4798-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p>Down at the V&amp;A Waterfront I purchased a USB Internet stick for my computer, so I could access the Internet during my bicycle tour across South Africa.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20310" alt="IMG_4787" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4787-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p>I also purchased an inexpensive pair of sunglasses. The sunglasses look good by themselves, but they look horrible on my face. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had a owned a pair of sunglasses that have looked good on me. I need someone with some fashion sense to go with me the next time I buy sunglasses. I seriously can&#8217;t do it by myself.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-20314" alt="IMG_4800" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4800-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p>Then I walked all the way back from the Waterfront to my house in Observatory. By the time I got there, my feet were killing me and I was happy to see that Monica was finally gone. I could relax and be on my own once again. Big cities, I am finding out, are not my favorite places in the world. The people, cars and crowds wear me out. I&#8217;m much happier being all alone in a private home or at the top of a remote mountain top. That&#8217;s where I am at my best.</p>
