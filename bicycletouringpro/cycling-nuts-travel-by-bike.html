<h1>Do You Have To Be A &#8220;Cycling Nut&#8221; In Order To Travel By Bike?</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="cycling nut" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2009/03/cycling-fanatic.jpg" alt="" width="658" height="223" /></p>
<p>People think that just because I&#8217;ve ridden my bike across the United States six times and traveled through a dozen different countries on a two-wheeled vehicle, that this somehow translates into me being a bicycling maniac. They think that because I&#8217;ve done all these things that I&#8217;ve got to be &#8220;one of those nuts&#8221; they see zipping around their town on Saturday mornings dressed in spandex and a neon pink jersey plastered with logos.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p><em>THAT&#8217;S NOT ME!</em></p>
<p>In fact, you want to know something else? Something very few people know? Okay. Here it is:</p>
<p><strong>After almost ten years of long distance biking, I still don&#8217;t consider myself to be a cyclist&#8230; and frankly I don&#8217;t think I ever will. </strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll hear it again and again. When most people find out that you are cycling for days on end, sleeping in a tent, and relying on the kindness of strangers to get from one place to the next, the most common response you are bound to get goes something like this:</p>
<p>“Are you crazy?”</p>
<p>Most of us take it as a compliment, but it brings up a subject worth discussing.</p>
<p>Many people think you have to be nuts in order to go on a bike tour. And even those that don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s crazy to travel by bike, many still believe that you have to be a cycling fanatic in order to conduct a long distance bike tour. They think you&#8217;ve got to have the latest high-tech gear. They believe you&#8217;ve got to be 100% up to date with the latest specs and terminology. And they think that going fast and getting there in record time is what bicycling is all about.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the truth: <strong>YOU DON&#8217;T NEED TO BE A CYCLING FANATIC IN ORDER TO TRAVEL BY BIKE.</strong></p>
<p>What&#8217;s so great about bicycle touring is that it is the un-sport of the cycling world. We aren&#8217;t out there to win races. Most of us aren&#8217;t licensed bicycle mechanics. And most of us don&#8217;t do extensive training before we set out on our rides.</p>
<p>While we all ride for different reasons and enjoy different aspects of the cycling experience, I am here to once and for all to bust the myth that you have to be a “cycling nut” in order to go on a bike tour. It simply isn&#8217;t true!</p>
<p>If you are a first time bicycle traveler and you&#8217;re stressing out about learning all the terminology, knowing every little detail of your bike, and keeping up with faster riders in your group&#8230; don&#8217;t worry about all that! Just get on your bike&#8230; start riding&#8230; and do whatever you can to have fun along the way!</p>
