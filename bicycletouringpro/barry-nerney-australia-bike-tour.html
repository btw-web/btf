<h1>Barry Nerney Completes His First 10-Day Bicycle Tour In Australia</h1>
<p>Barry Nerney is a BicycleTouringPro.com reader from Australia who recent completed a bicycle tour through the interior or his home country. Here&#8217;s what Barry had to say about his bicycle touring adventure:</p>
<p><strong>Where exactly did you go on your bicycle tour and how many days were you on the road?</strong></p>
<p>Started out from Ipswich in Queensland with the intention of riding to Newcastle NSW. Choosing the inland scenic route over the Border Ranges from Boonah for three nights, Rathdowey for two nights,Kyogle, Casino, Grafton and Coffs Harbour for one night each for a total of ten days.</p>
<p>As you suggested Darren, I found it necessary to mail two packages of gear home to lighten my load. My bags were overloaded and suffering damage when traveling downhill at speed and coming to bumpy ground. Initially figured on averaging 60klms/day but the reality was 40 allowing for time in the morning to break camp from dedicated Parks and arriving at next destination about mid afternoon to set up camp and take in the particular communities on both days</p>
<p><strong>What was your biggest fear when planning or preparing for your trip by bike? And how exactly did you overcome that fear?</strong></p>
<p>My biggest fear was traveling alone with the possibility of encountering undesirables along the way. That or having my gear or bicycle stolen.</p>
<p>However, I exercised a positive faith and trust in God&#8217;s protection and avoided camping in isolated places.</p>
<p><strong>What was the thing you liked most about your bicycle tour?</strong></p>
<p>The beautiful scenery seen from the seat of the pushy rather than a vehicle; the cooling swims in the creeks and rivers along the way; The downhill runs and the refreshing breezes.</p>
<p><strong>What was the thing you liked LEAST about your bicycle touring experience&#8230; and how did you think that aspect of your travels could be improved upon in the future?</strong></p>
<p>The fact that I was overloaded and had to walk many hills. In future I will naturally travel lighter and choose more achievable terrain.  I did encounter rain, wind and heat, but this is all par for the course. Being close to 71 years old I am thankful that I can complete each day&#8217;s ride without being stiff, sore or tired.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing you learned from your bicycle tour?</strong></p>
<p>I learned that I an do this and I look forward to doing a 9-day supported ride around Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think you&#8217;ll conduct more bicycle tours in the future? If so, where do you want to go?</strong></p>
<p>Yes!! Western Australia for one. There are so many amazing places to experience on this planet.</p>
<p><strong>What one piece of advice would you give to someone who is planning his or her first bicycle touring adventure?</strong></p>
<p>Make it a priority! Don&#8217;t risk looking back on your life with regrets that it is no longer possible.</p>
