<h1>Cycling Trails, Outdoor Adventures &#038; Unique Wildlife In Gulf Country, Florida</h1>
<p>This post brought to you by <a href="http://izea.it/acWlGbX" rel="nofollow">Gulf County Florida</a>. The content and opinions expressed below are that of Bicycle Touring Pro.</p>
<p>Situated on the state&#8217;s infamous panhandle, <a href="http://www.visitgulf.com/adventure-guides" target="_blank">Gulf County, Florida</a> is the home to a population of approximately 15,000 people and 244 miles of coastline. Due to it&#8217;s location on the Gulf of Mexico in the southern part of the United States, Gulf County, Florida makes for an excellent destination to go cycling, hiking, boating, golfing, kayaking, snorkeling or enjoy an array of other outdoor activities. Whether it&#8217;s spring, summer, winter or fall, there&#8217;s always something to do in Gulf County, Florida!</p>

<h3>Cycling &amp; Walking Trails</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-33319" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2016/08/gulf-county-florida-cycling-660x440.jpg" alt="Cycling Paths in Gulf County, Florida" width="660" height="440" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a family-friendly activity to do in Gulf County, Florida, then consider a bike ride along the Loggerhead Run Bike Path &#8211; an eight mile trail that runs the length of the Cape from St. Joseph Peninsula State Park to Salinas Park along Hwy 30E. This dedicated cycling/walking route is a flat and easy-to-enjoy paved trail that the entirely family will appreciate and is ideal for cycling, running or walking. Other notable bike/walking trails in the area include the Windmark Beach Trail and the Baywalk Trail &#8211; each of which is a traffic-free path intended for the use of walkers, joggers and cyclists only.</p>
<h3>Bird-Watching &amp; Wildlife</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-33320" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2016/08/gulf-county-florida-dolphin-660x440.jpg" alt="dolphins in gulf county florida" width="660" height="440" /></p>
<p>If wildlife is your thing, there&#8217;s no shortage of that in Gulf County, Florida. Honeybees dash from flower to flower, while deer frolic in the forests, dolphins leap from the bay, sea turtles swim off the seashore, and eagles fly overhead. Due to it&#8217;s location on the water, Gulf County, Florida is the home to a vast array of marine wildlife &#8211; including seals, sharks, starfish, seahorses, oysters and a whole lot more! On the land, however, visitors to Gulf County might be fortunate enough to spot rare birds, a panther, bobcat, or even one of Florida&#8217;s famous alligators!</p>
<h3>Boating &amp; Sailing</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-33326" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2016/08/boating-in-florida-660x440.jpg" alt="boating and sailing in florida" width="660" height="440" /></p>
<p>One of the best ways to explore Gulf County, Florida is by boat. Due to its location on the Gulf of Mexico and it&#8217;s close proximity to Panama City, Florida, there are a large number of boating and sailing options available. The Port St. Joe Marina is located in the heart of St. Joseph Bay and is the primary destination for those wishing to get out on the open water. The Marina features over a hundred wet slips and nearly a hundred more dry storage areas, as well as a gift shop, a spacious restroom/shower area and laundry facilities. If you don&#8217;t have your own boat, rental boats are available through <em><a href="http://www.seahorsewatersafaris.com/" target="_blank">Seahorse Water Safaris</a></em> at the Port St. Joe Marina, as well as a variety of guided trips, eco-tours, shelling excursions, sunset cruises and snorkeling adventures!</p>
<h3>Camping</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-33321" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2016/08/gulf-county-florida-camping-660x440.jpg" alt="camping in gulf county, florida" width="660" height="440" /></p>
<p>While vacation homes, hotels and B&amp;Bs are available throughout there area, many who come to Gulf County, Florida do so in order to get closer to nature&#8230; and there&#8217;s not better way to do that than to go camping! Throughout Gulf County, campers will find a variety of full-facility campsites offering tent and RV sites with water and electricity. Amenities such as in-ground pools, kitchenettes, onsite ice and general stores are often included and pets are often welcome, too! <a href="http://www.indianpasscamp.com/">Indian Pass Campground</a>, <a href="http://www.visitgulf.com/www.visitgulf.com/listing/presnell-s-bayside-marina-rv-1" target="_blank">Presnell’s RV Resort &amp; Outfitters</a> and <a href="http://www.visitgulf.com/article/dead-lakes-recreation-area">Dead Lakes Park Campground</a> in Wewahitchka are some of the more popular and well-equipped campgrounds in the area.</p>
<h3>Diving &amp; Snorkeling</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-33327" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2016/08/snorkeling-in-gulf-county-florida-660x440.jpg" alt="best snorkeling in florida" width="660" height="440" /></p>
<p>While there is a vast array of birds and wildlife to be see on land, there are also hundreds of unique plant and animal species living in the Gulf County area that can only be seen by getting in the water &#8211; which is why diving and snorkeling are some of the most popular outdoor activities in the area. With more than 200 artificial reefs in the vicinity, Gulf Country visitors can dive on artificial reefs that are as close as 2 miles from shore and as far out as 45 miles in the Gulf of Mexico. Most dives range in depth from 20 to 150 feet. One of the most popular dives in the area is to the 463-foot long <em>Empire Mica</em> &#8211; a British Tanker that was sunk by a German submarine during World War II and is considered to be one of Florida’s best wreck dives at a depth of just 108 feet.</p>
<h3>Golf, Volleyball, Basketball &amp; Tennis</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-33322" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2016/08/gulf-county-florida-tennis-660x440.jpg" alt="Tennis and Golf in Gulf County Florida" width="660" height="440" /></p>
<p>Golfers will be in heaven when they see the links at <a href="http://www.stjoebaygolf.com" target="_blank">St. Joseph’s Bay Golf Club</a>, situated between Port St. Joe and Cape San Blas &#8211; across the road from St. Joseph Bay. Situated so close to the water you might have a difficult time telling where the course ends and nature begins, St. Joseph&#8217;s Bay Golf Course is open to the public with a par-72, 18-hole layout and a USGA Rating of 71.7. While golf is a major attraction in the state of Florida, there are a number of other outdoor activities in Gulf County that you are sure to enjoy. For example, volleyball, basketball, and tennis courts can be found at a number of parks in the area, including those at Frank Pate Park, Veterans Memorial Park at Beacon Hill and Salinas Park-Bayside.</p>
<h3>Kayaking &amp; Stand-Up-Paddling</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-33325" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2016/08/kayaking-in-florida-660x440.jpg" alt="kayaking in gulf county florida" width="660" height="440" /></p>
<p>Finally, a visit to Gulf County, Florida wouldn&#8217;t be complete without a kayak or stand-up-paddling adventure. Kayaking and paddle-boarding are two great ways to explore St. Joseph Bay and connect with the great outdoors. Whether you use your kayak to fish from or you simply want to get out on the water and have a little exercise, a trip around the bay on a kayak or a paddle-board is an absolute must! Bring your own equipment or rent a kayak/paddle-board from one of the many outfitters in Port St. Joe, WindMark Beach, St. Joe Beach or Cape San Blas. Canoes, paddle-boards and kayaks of all shapes and sizes can be had at relatively inexpensive prices. Make sure you inquire about participating in a guided kayak or paddle-board adventure if you want a behind-the-scenes look at all that Gulf County, Florida has to offer!</p>
