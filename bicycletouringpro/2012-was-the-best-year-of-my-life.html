<p>Now that 2013 is just around the corner, I&#8217;m starting to wonder how I can make next year even better?</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s going to be tough, but here&#8217;s what I have planned thus far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ll be spending the New Year in Krakow, Poland.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On January 1st I am launching a new website for people who are interested in guided bicycle tours. It will be the sister-site to the website here at <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Then I&#8217;ll ride my bicycle through the cold and snow to Slovakia, where I plan to spend a week or so skiing in the mountains.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Then I&#8217;ll cross through the Czech Republic and cycle back into southern Poland. I plan to visit a friend in Wroclaw before cycling north to the city of Poznan.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ll remain in Poznan, where I will then put the finishing touches on my new Winter Cycling book before launching it to the public.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ll then fly to South Africa and spend three months bicycle touring around the country.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I also plan on traveling through the neighboring countries of Mozambique, Swaziland and Lesotho.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Then I&#8217;ll fly back to Los Angeles, California, where I plan to spend a month or so visiting with my parents, friends and family.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After that I am going to be riding a motorcycle (possibly with my bicycle in tow) across the United Stats and Canada.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the fall of 2013, I&#8217;ll be participating in the <a title="Cabot Trail bicycle tour" href="http://www.freewheeling.ca/adventures/NovaScotiaCabotTrail.html" target="_blank">Cabot Trail bicycle tour</a> with <em>Freewheeling Adventures</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And what I do after that I&#8217;m not exactly sure.</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to take this moment to thank you for being a part of this amazing year&#8230; and I hope you&#8217;ll continue to follow my adventures in 2013 and beyond.</p>
<p>More than that, however, I hope that what I&#8217;ve done this year has inspired you in some small way.</p>
<p>So many people I meet on my travels are under the impression that what I do is out of reach for them personally. But there&#8217;s very little I did this year that you could not do.</p>
<p>The secret, I think, to accomplishing what you want most in life, is to know what you want to accomplish and then start taking small steps towards that goal every single day.</p>
<p>Determination, the willingness to get a little dirty and make a few sacrifices along the way is really all it takes.</p>
<p>I challenge you to give it a try this year. Think of at least one thing you REALLY want to do over the next 12 months and begin taking small steps towards that goal every single day. Before you know it, you&#8217;ll have accomplished what you set out to accomplish.</p>
<p>Take one small step toward your goal every day and before you know it you will have found a new job, <a title="Ride A Bicycle Across Europe" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/the-bicycle-travelers-blueprint/">ridden a bicycle across Europe</a>, learned how to paraglide, taught yourself a new language and who knows what else!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to try my hardest to make 2013 the best year ever&#8230; and I hope you will do the same.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your wonderful support&#8230; and here&#8217;s to an incredible New Year!</p>
