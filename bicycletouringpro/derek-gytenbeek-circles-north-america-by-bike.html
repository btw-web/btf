<h1>21 Year Old Canadian, Derek Gytenbeek, Circles North America By Bike</h1>
<p>When I put out my call for people to feature here on <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em>, Derek Gytenbeek was one of the first individuals to contact me. Just 21 years old, Derek is currently in the midst of a year long bicycle adventure around North America. At this moment, he&#8217;s sitting just north of Acapulco, Mexico, has been on the road for about three months and has plans to be traveling for a great deal longer.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>First of all Derek, where are you from and what was your life like before you left on your trip?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was born, raised, and have lived all 21 years of my life in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.   I can&#8217;t say I have ever settled down to a normal life. Since high school, I&#8217;ve spent one year traveling around Canada and two years working two different nine to five labor jobs in the construction industry. In June of 2008, run down and worn out from the humdrum of full-time work, I joined the Otesha Project (<a href="http://www.otesha.ca/" target="_blank">www.otesha.ca</a>). Otesha is a youth run charitable organization that uses bicycle touring and theater to mobilize youth and to create local and global changes through their every day consumer choices. For two months I was part of an incredible group delivering theater performances while touring Vancouver Island B.C. From this I was inspired to continue further and have been cycling ever since.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>How did you first find out about bicycle touring?</strong></h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">Bicycle touring has always had some part in my life. I come from a family of cyclists. As a youngster I was lucky enough to be taken on many outdoor trips with family and friends, including a bicycle tour of British Columbia&#8217;s scenic Kettle Valley Railway, an old abandoned railway that stretches across southern B.C.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">I do however remember the day that re-fueled my enthusiasm for bike touring. In the summer of 2006 I met a group of young people on the first day of their bicycle tour from Vancouver to Tijuana on the U.S. Mexico border. I cycled alongside this group for the entire day secretly hoping they&#8217;d take me along. But alas, we reached the U.S. border and I recognized that with no money, no passport, and no gear, my trip wouldn&#8217;t be very enjoyable. My hopes of calling into work with the message &#8220;I won&#8217;t be in for a couple of months, I&#8217;m riding my bike to Mexico&#8221;, were eradicated. But from that point on I entertained all possibilities of bike touring, understanding then how easily accessible it really was. All I had to do was pack up and pedal.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Why did you give bicycle touring a try? And why did you decide to go where you did?</strong></h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">I decided to give bicycle touring a try for countless reasons. After two years of mind numbing full time work I developed an colossal craving for new experiences. I had no post-secondary education but the thought of sitting in a classroom was none too inspiring, and after completing high school I&#8217;d felt as though I had done my time. So, I decided to take a vacation. With some saved money in the bank, no car, no mortgage, and no children, all I had to do was quit my job and I would be a free man. I&#8217;d been a cycling fanatic for some time and knew this would be the perfect way to travel. This was my chance to ride to Mexico!</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">The two summer months I spent riding with the Otesha Project didn&#8217;t fully satisfy my bicycle cravings, so I immediately began planning my solo adventure. This was a process that would take me less than two weeks, as I was already packed. Heading south was my only option with Canada&#8217;s winter swiftly approaching. The original plan was never to come this far, but to migrate the U.S. Mexico border and wait out the winter.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">But my route plan has grown cheerfully out of control like an untamed garden, and has been more of a developing process than a one time decision. Shortly before leaving I received a telephone call from my brother. He was quitting his job to ride with me. This was excellent news. And with a riding partner I felt comfortable crossing the border into Mexico. Together we would ride to Cabo San Lucas at the southern tip of Mexico`s Baja peninsula.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Over two months later, halfway down the Baja, I was struck with the inspiration to cycle the Yucatan Peninsula. At the time I wasn&#8217;t aware of the distance between myself and the Yucatan, but decided that if it wasn&#8217;t too far I would ride the stretch. I checked out a map and was dismayed to see that it was over 2500 miles away! But by this point I had already subconsciously made my decision, I was going to ride the entire expanse of Mexico.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">And today I sit in Puerto Escondido, in the south of Mexico, my latest expectation is to ride as far as the southern end of Belize, before returning to Canada via the east coast of Mexico and U.S. The final leg of my journey will take me across Canada, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. But of course, nothing is etched in stone.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>What type of bike and gear are you using on your trip and why did you select those particular items? </strong></h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m riding a Trek 520. I decided on this bike through Internet research. My knowledge of bicycles is very limited, but I knew what I was looking for. I needed a touring ready bike that could stand up to my abusive habits and one that would continue to roll with a minimum of daily maintenance. I&#8217;ve been very impressed by the Trek. It has survived my occasional mishandling and the only troubles I&#8217;ve experienced come form the natural wear and tear of bicycle touring, an activity that&#8217;s rough on any bike.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">In addition to the Trek, I&#8217; m riding with a set of three <a title="Axiom Gear bicycle panniers" href="http://www.axiomgear.com">Axiom dry panniers</a> (two on the front rack, one on the back) as well as a different rear right pannier from Canada&#8217;s Mountain Equipment Co-op (this is because I wore a hole through my other Axiom dry bag). With the plan to ride the Pacific coast through October and November I figured dry bags would be a marvelous idea. I purchased the Axioms because they were on sale and the only bags I could afford. At this point in my trip the stitching is slowly starting to fall apart and my rear bag tends to flop around on my rack while I ride, which can get to be a nuisance. You get what you pay for. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend economizing on gear for an extensive trip if this can be avoided, yet these bags still get the job done.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>What did your family and friends think about you leaving on such an epic bike ride? Did they think you could do it? Were they nervous? Excited? Scared?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">My father was really the only person I talked to about this trip, and being an adventure seeker himself, he was and still is very excited for me. And of course some people are nervous for my well being, after all, I&#8217;m cycling through unknown areas on precarious roads with dangerous drivers in shaky vehicles, but that&#8217;s half the fun.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>What is the best place you have been thus far?</strong></h3>
<div style="text-align: left;">One place that stands out is Cabo Pulmo and its surrounding area. This paradise lies on the southern tip of the Baja, east of Cabo San Lucas. Only accessible by &#8220;graded dirt road&#8221;, this side trip was an undertaking worth every jostle and crash. Along with my brother and a friend I cycled thirty miles across washboard gravel and through broad and abysmal sand pits. Located beside a living coral reef, the area has the best snorkeling I&#8217;ve encountered thus far. We spent some time relaxing and reading under palm trees and palapas. We did some spear fishing as well, cooking our catches on nightly campfires. The few days spent there were the perfect respite from the obnoxious stink and clatter of highway riding.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Honorable mention goes to the Oregon coast for being supremely scenic and biker friendly.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>What&#8217;s been the best experience of the trip thus far?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The greatest experience has been meeting many marvelous and fascinating new friends along the way. My brother and I met three people that have been circumnavigating the globe on bicycles for nearly six years! We met a few folks riding from Alaska to Patagonia, and we&#8217;ve had the pleasure of spending time and riding with different people from all over the world. Since my brother stopped in Mazatlan, I&#8217;ve been cycling with a high school teacher we met on the Baja peninsula. There&#8217;s barrels of knowledge to be gained from the people you meet, and this is an invaluable part of bike touring.  I&#8217;ve been on the road for three and a half months, and I&#8217;ll be riding alone for the first time thus far just one week from now.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>What has been the biggest surprise thus far? What’s the biggest thing you’ve learned?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The biggest surprise and unequaled learning opportunity came from the flat troubles I experienced on the Baja. With five flat tires in the first two months of my trip, I was bursting with confidence, certain that I was ready for anything Mexico had to offer. I was frightened and alarmed when my flat count instantaneously jumped. For over a week I was suffering through five flats a day, and I was completely unprepared to deal with the situation.  My tires were worn, my rim tape was peeling off, and the cacti were playing games with me. I do have a word of warning for those hoping to cycle through less developed countries with touring road bikes. These bikes are an alien species in countries such as Mexico. Spare parts are nearly impossible to find, including tubes and tires for 700mm wheels. I came into Mexico completely ignorant to this and suffered through this difficult month with over sixty flats. I was in desperate need of two new touring tires, new tubes, and new rim tape. It&#8217;s been a month long struggle, but I&#8217;ve finally acquired what I need. Most of these parts have arrived via airplane with friends and family of some amazing cyclists I&#8217;ve met along the way. If you plan on cycling Mexico with a road bike, be sure to come well prepared to tackle any issue yourself.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>How much is the tour costing you per day? How much money have you spent?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Coming through the U.S. I was comfortably spending about $20-$25 per day. Through Mexico I&#8217;ve been spending about $10-$15 per day. Thus far, three and a half months into the trip, I&#8217;ve spent about $2200 US. One great part about Mexico is the easily available free roadside camping.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>If you had just one piece of advice for someone who was new to bicycle touring, what would you tell them?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">If I had to choose just one, I would say to persevere through the hard times. Bike touring will never be without frustrations and quagmires, but the rewards are worth every trial. And the trials make for unrivaled learning opportunities.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>You’ve still got a lot of your tour left. Are there any parts of the tour you are really looking forward to? </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wow, there&#8217;s so much to look forward to. I&#8217;m especially eager to see the ancient ruins of Palenque, Chichen Itza, and Tulum, as well as some of the less visited historic sites in Belize. I&#8217;m expecting to arrive in Cancun for SPRING BREAK 2009! This may or may not be a good time (large crowds are not my scene), but it will be an experience. I also have a mysterious draw to America&#8217;s deep south and the New Orleans (hopefully recovering) jazz scene.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Even though you still have much of your trip in front of you, what do you plan on doing once your tour comes to an end? </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">So far my plan is to gather my friends and make a beeline for the pub. From there I&#8217;ll sort things out. I suppose finding a job and a home will be my first priority. I&#8217;d be very interested in improving my knowledge of bicycle mechanics, this will better prepare myself for my next tour.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>And When I asked Derek if there was anything else he&#8217;d like to add, this is what he said:<br />
</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Male, 6&#8217;2&#8243;, brown hair, green eyes. Always looking for more bicycle friends. Interests include: bicycling, music, and over-consumption of baked goods. If anyone wants to join me for any upcoming stretch of my tour, company is always welcome. You just have to put up with my idiosyncrasies. I foresee a severe case of loneliness by the time I reach Texas in late March or early April.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>If you have a question or comment for Derek, please leave your message for him in the comments section below. I will ask him to check back every once and awhile and answer any questions that you might have for him. </strong></p>
