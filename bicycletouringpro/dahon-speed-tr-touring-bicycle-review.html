<h1>Dahon Speed TR &#8211; Touring Bicycle Review</h1>
<p>The <a title="Dahon Speed TR touring bicycle" href="http://dahonbikes.com/index.php?id=99&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_dahonproducts=20" target="_blank"><em>Dahon Speed TR</em></a> is a folding touring bicycle.  It folds in half just like all the other <em>Dahon</em> bicycles. Where it differs, however, is in its low-gearing capability, and its front and rear racks, which make the bike suitable for light touring.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-14659" title="DahonSpeedTR" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2012/04/DahonSpeedTR-588x407.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="457" /></p>
<p>I own the 2008 model of the <em>Dahon Speed TR</em> and I paid around $1,100 USD plus labor for the shop to assemble and tune it for me.  Although there are many online retailers for <em>Dahon</em> bicycles, I always recommend working with a local bicycle shop if you can.  Doing business with an authorized <em>Dahon</em> dealer extends many benefits as well.</p>
<p>The <em>Speed TR </em>is really a complete bicycle, with touring racks, a generator light, battery-operated rear light, removable pedals and even bar ends.  You would be hard-pressed to think of anything that would need to be added.  The first thing I added, however, were fenders, which makes a lot of sense if you intend to be riding this bike daily and or using the bike in rainy, snowy, or muddy conditions.</p>
<p>The bicycle also comes with a front mount for optional luggage from <em>Dahon</em>.  After purchasing the bicycle, I later bought the <a title="Dahon tour bag" href="http://dahonbikes.com/index.php?id=68" target="_blank">front tour bag</a>, which came in handy for packing small items during local commutes (e.g. take-out food, small groceries and my bike lock).  It mounts directly to the frame with a special attachment, so it won’t affect handling.</p>
<p>The <em>Speed TR</em> is more upright than your typical road bike.  This is great for enjoying the view while you ride.  The handlebars feature a fore and aft adjustment to rotate the handlebars further away or closer to you, depending on how much reach you need.</p>
<p>Unlike some of the other <em>Dahon</em> models, the steering on the <em>Speed TR</em> is not telescopic. However, you can raise the bars an inch or so by rotating the handlebars to the top/center position.  I stand sixty-six inches tall, with a short inseam measurement, so I have difficulty fitting on regular road bikes.  The <em>Dahon Speed TR</em> was easy for me to adjust to and the frame makes it easy to mount and dismount.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about frame flex, there isn’t any.  <em>Dahon</em> seems to be phasing out steel frame bicycles, and to date, the <em>Speed TR</em> might be one of three models left in the line-up that isn’t made of aluminum. It&#8217;s made out of chromoly steel instead!</p>
<p>One of my favorite features of this bicycle is the SRAM Dual Drive.  It features an internal three-speed hub, which simulates the action of a front derailleur.  The nice thing about this hub is that you can click through it at a standstill &#8212; very handy for traveling through frequent traffic lights or for making a sudden, unplanned stop.  The Dual Drive is paired with a normal rear derailleur and shifting takes place with a trigger shifter on the handlebars.</p>
<p>After some extended rides on the <em>Speed TR</em> I found myself searching for more hand positions.  The bicycle&#8217;s bar ends were useful for climbing, but with only two hand positions, I found myself going numb on long rides.  I also had trouble with my thumbs getting tired from frequent shifting, although I believe the 2012 model now comes with a grip shifter, which seems to be a better option.</p>
<p>The only other minor quibble I have with the bike is the bottle cage mounting point.  Because of the frame’s design, the water bottle is mounted nearly horizontal.  A steep descent or even a sudden stop is enough to send your bottle flying.  Plus, anyone who has cycled any non-trivial distance knows that one water bottle isn’t sufficient anyway.  I wear a hydration backpack and/or store additional water bottles in my panniers.</p>
<p>To solve my problem with the flat handlebars and the numbness I was experiencing as a result, I eventually swapped out the standard handlebars that come with the bike and replaced them with <a title="Bullhorn handlebars" href="http://www.cheapbikeparts360.com/products/syntace-stratos-bull-horn-bar/" target="_blank">Syntace bullhorns</a>, which gave me more positions in which to rest my hands.  Road-style shifters replaced the triggers, so brake adapters had to be installed.  The rear brake adapters also displaced the rear rack’s usual mounting points, and so the struts had to be re-mounted with clamps along the seat stays.  It’s not a big deal; just be aware that this was a consequence of modifying the bike’s original design<sup id="cite_ref-0"></sup>.  After the modifications I made, the bike seems to perform just as well as it did previously, although I sometimes wonder if the new shifting arrangement affected the gear range on the lower end.</p>
<p>The <em>Dahon Speed TR</em> is a great bike for light tours.  Because of its smaller stature, however, you have to be realistic about its load-carrying capacity.  With front and rear racks, it can be tempting to try a fully-loaded configuration.  I have tried this, and with twenty-one gear inches on the low end, I found climbing to be difficult.  I am not a small person, and carrying four loaded panniers is exceedingly tough.  Nowadays, I stick only with what will fit in two bags.  You can still use four panniers, but I would advise against filling them all to full capacity.  Personally, I limit my load to two moderately filled rear panniers, whatever the front tour bag can carry, plus a hydration pack on my back.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-14661" title="Folded-DahonSpeedTR" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2012/04/Folded-DahonSpeedTR.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="389" /></p>
<p>The <em>Speed TR</em> is a great travel bike.  I have often used it on multi-modal tours.  My favorite way to travel is to pack the bike into the optional <a title="Dahon Airporter Suitcase" href="http://dahonbikes.com/index.php?id=68" target="_blank">Airporter Suitcase</a>, send it to my destination via Federal Express, and then unpack it when I arrive.  The rest of my trip is an enjoyable bicycle touring experience.  I have also used the Airporter suitcase once on a Greyhound bus trip<sup id="cite_ref-0"></sup>.  Because of the <em>Speed TR’</em>s versatility, it also happens to be my daily commuter bike.  I have often done my grocery shopping with it, carrying a 2.5-gallon water jug in a pannier, groceries in the other, and a couple of other grocery bags secured to the top of the rear rack.</p>
<p>In the end, the <em>Dahon Speed TR is</em> a great little bike for light touring and local commuting. For those who want to conduct some shorter bicycle tours and at the same time enjoy the benefits that come with a folding bicycle, the <em>Speed TR</em> is a great and affordable choice.</p>

<p><sup id="cite_ref-0"></sup> <em>In hindsight, I probably would have been just as happy had I replaced the standard handlebars with perhaps a mustache bar or similar bar that would have made possible retention of the standard components.  The biggest pain point seems to have been the use of v-brake adapters, from having chosen STI levers.</em></p>
<p><sup id="cite_ref-0"></sup> <em>Although I wasn’t charged for it, the suitcase is technically over-sized.  I doubt I would want to try the same thing for an airplane trip, because of the potential fees involved.</em></p>
