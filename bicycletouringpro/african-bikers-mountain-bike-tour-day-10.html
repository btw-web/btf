<p>Day 10 of our African Bikers mountain bike tour across South Africa began with breakfast and a drive. Leaving the Rooiberg Lodge behind, we were dropped off in a beautifully green and hilly mountain region and picked up again later in the day by Kim, our driver.</p>
<p>The ride was a constant up and down with medium-sized hills, fire roads and several gate crossings.</p>

<p>We cycled through one region that had recently been set on fire. Evidence of a massive burn was everywhere you looked&#8230; and you could still smell the smoke in the air.</p>

<p>At the end of our ride was a steep rocky downhill, which I was able to navigate without getting off my bike (which I was very proud of having done).</p>
<p>By the time we reached Kim in the waiting vehicle, I was hot and tired. Myself and a few others in our group dunked our feet in a nearby swimming pool and then drove 20+ kilometers out to the main road in the van, while Harry and Kirsten chose to cycle the long dirt road on their mountain bikes.</p>
<p>We ate lunch where that long dirt road that Harry and Kirsten were cycling and the main highway met &#8211; at a small roadside restaurant/gas station (owned by Mark &#8211; our tour guide from the day before).</p>
<p>As a vegetarian, I was served a &#8220;veggie pie,&#8221; and while I was skeptical at first, I really enjoyed it! I drank two sodas and ate two ice creams while we were stopped at this small outdoor/indoor cafe.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-19511" alt="IMG_3114" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3114-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>

<p>Then we loaded ourselves back into the van and drove for quite some time to yet another guesthouse (this one in Mossel Bay, South Africa), where we were each assigned a room, took a shower, and then met later in the evening for dinner at a local seafood restaurant.</p>
