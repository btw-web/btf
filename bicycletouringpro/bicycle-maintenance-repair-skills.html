<p><b>QUESTION: </b>Is there anything specific you need to know about bicycle maintenance and repair before attempting a bicycle tour of any kind? Which bicycle maintenance and repair skills are necessary?<b> </b></p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The truth is, I’m not a bicycle mechanic and I don&#8217;t really enjoy fixing up or cleaning my bicycle. But even though I don&#8217;t like repairing flat tires, adjusting my brakes or cleaning my chain, I still know how to do all of these things&#8230; and if you’re planning to conduct a bicycle tour of any length, you need to know a few basic bicycle maintenance and repair skills.</p>
<p>Before you head off on your first cycling adventure, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install a new tire</li>
<li>Replace a flat tube with a new one</li>
<li>Patch a bike tube with a patch kit</li>
<li>Adjust your front and rear brakes</li>
<li>Install new brake pads</li>
<li>Adjust the height and position of both your seat post, saddle and handlebars</li>
<li>Install your front and rear racks (if you are using racks and panniers)</li>
<li>Attach your trailer (if you are using a trailer)</li>
<li>Clean your bike chain</li>
<li>Adjust your front and rear derailleurs</li>
<li>And install/remove your pedals</li>
</ul>
<p>If doing any of these things frightens you, then you definitely have some work to do.</p>
<p>The good news is, all of these things are pretty easy to do&#8230; and if you practice doing these things just a few times before you leave home, you will really save yourself some grief once you get out on the road.</p>
<p>If you have no idea how to do one or more of the repairs/adjustments I just listed, then I suggest you either find a friend who can teach you, or you get a book that will teach you how to make these basic repairs and adjustments to your bicycle.</p>
<p>There are a lot of great books out there that deal with basic bicycle maintenance, but one of the best places to start is with &#8220;<a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/bikerepairbook">The Bicycling Guide to Complete Bicycle Maintenance and Repair</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>This book covers everything mentioned above&#8230; and a whole lot more. I know a lot of people who have purchased this book, learned the basic repairs, and then photocopied some of the more advanced repairs to bring with them on their travels &#8211; just in case! This is probably a good idea.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t worry! You don&#8217;t need to become a certified bike mechanic in order to go on a bicycle tour. Just learn the basics and you&#8217;ll feel so much more confident once you hit the road.</p>
