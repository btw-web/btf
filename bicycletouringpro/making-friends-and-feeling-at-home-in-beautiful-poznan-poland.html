<h1>Making Friends And Feeling At Home In Beautiful Poznan, Poland</h1>
<p>Two weeks was not enough time. I&#8217;ve been to Poznan, Poland several times before, but I had no idea I would make so many friends here during my short two weeks in the city. I really love this place and the people that I&#8217;ve met here.</p>
<p>For the last two weeks I&#8217;ve been staying in this spacious studio apartment in the <span class="st">Jezyce</span> district of Poznan, Poland. I rented the place on <a title="AirBNB" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/airbnb" target="_blank">AirBNB.com</a> and have quickly become friends with not only the owner of the apartment, but also her boyfriend, brother and various other friends.</p>

<p>During my time in Poznan I made several trips to the <a title="Bigfoot Coffee Shop" href="http://www.facebook.com/BigfootCoffeeShop" target="_blank">Bigfoot Coffee Shop</a> to visit with my American friend, Erik Witsoe, who not only runs the place, but is also an amazing photographer and is capturing Poznan in a unique way through his work at <a title="Erik Witsoe" href="http://www.facebook.com/ErikWitsoePhotography" target="_blank">Erik Witsoe Photography</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-24836" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2014/06/IMG_3818-588x388.jpg" alt="Customers gather inside the tiny Bigfoot Coffee Shop in Poznan, Poland" width="588" height="388" /></p>
<p>I also spent about 8 days during my short two weeks in Poznan taking <a title="Poznan, Poland table tennis club and school" href="http://szkolkatenisa.com.pl/" target="_blank">table-tennis lessons</a> from Wieslaw Witek. Wieslaw doesn&#8217;t know any English&#8230; and I know only a few words in Polish, so our lessons together are pretty interesting, but I&#8217;ve learned a lot from our lessons together&#8230; and had a lot of fun as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-24846" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2014/06/IMG_3893-588x350.jpg" alt="IMG_3893" width="588" height="350" /></p>
<p>When Karolina (the woman I&#8217;m renting my apartment from) found out that I like table tennis, she informed me that her friend Lukasz had a ping-pong table in the basement of his apartment building, so she invited me over one night to play with her, Lukasz and her boyfriend, Marek. I ended up going to play with Lukasz on my own two additional times.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-24844" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2014/06/10430377_10202811890953010_7118347143638851450_n-588x392.jpg" alt="Flight Club ping-pong battle" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p>I also went on a number of bike rides while I was in Poznan. When I visited Poznan for the first time more than a year ago, the first place I went for a bike ride was in the nearby forests&#8230; and these forests are still one of my favorite places in all of Poznan.</p>

<p>I even managed to go on a bike ride with my friend Pawel, who I met the last year winter when I was in Poznan&#8230; and he invited his friend Daga (the lead singer for the Polish music group, <a title="Dagadana music" href="http://dagadana.pl/" target="_blank">Dagadana</a>, to go on a bike ride with us). We cycled out to a distant lake, ate some ice cream, and stood on the pier as the sun set over the trees and lake in the distance.</p>

<p>After making friends with Karolina, Marek, Lukasz and Lukasz&#8217;s girlfriend Marzena, I was invited to two separate dinners with the couples. At these dinners I was also introduced to Karolina&#8217;s brother (who is also named Lukasz) and his girlfriend, Anna. Karolina and Marek cooked up a bunch of food and we all consumed it out on the couple&#8217;s outdoor garden patio.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a photo of me (on the left) and Wieslaw Witek (my Polish table-tennis instructor (on the right)). The photo was taken on our last day of training together&#8230; and I&#8217;m bending my knees in an attempt to lower myself down to his level.</p>

<p>During my last week in Poznan, I met up with my friend Ariadna (who runs the fashion blog <a title="Help I have Nothing To Wear" href="http://helpihavenothingtowear.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Help, I Have Nothing To Wear</a>) and we ate smoothies together, went to lunch at a vegan restaurant, and then went on a long bike ride together out to Lake Strzeszynskie.</p>

<p>While in Poznan, I also shot a video for the website here at <em>BicycleTouringPro.com</em>. The video is my attempt at answering your questions about the recently re-published <a title="The Bicycle Touring Blueprint - The Ultimate Bike Tour Training Course" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/book/" target="_blank">Bicycle Touring Blueprint and the Ultimate Bike Tour Training Course</a>.</p>

<p>During my last day in Poznan, I woke up super early and rode around the city on my fully-loaded bicycle while Erik (from the Bigfoot Coffee Shop) took photos of me. Then I returned to my studio apartment, packed up my things and prepared to hit the road. Later in the evening, I met up with Ariadna again and she interviewed me for a school assignment and then we walked back to her apartment on a dark Sunday evening.</p>
<p>For the next 6+ months, my bicycle will be my home. I will cycle out of Poznan and continue riding north through Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland before traveling to Ireland in mid-August and continuing to the United Kingdom and Taiwan after that.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more photo, stories and videos from the road as I slowly pedal my way by bicycle through dozens of countries all around the world.
