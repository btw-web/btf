<h1>Bicycle Touring Is Hard</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-35505" src="https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC_9572-660x448.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="448" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Traveling by bike can be difficult, dirty and tough. You get sweaty, sunburnt and tired. Your legs become sore; your mind becomes weak; and the wind is sure to blow in your face at some point in your journey.  While traveling by bike, you will be forced to ride in the street and have cars and trucks pass you by at high speed &#8211; mere inches from your side. While on the road, you&#8217;ll need to watch out for dangerous animals, insects and human beings wishing to do you harm. You will be forced to ride in the rain, the sun and the snow. You will get lonely, bored and depressed. You&#8217;ll miss your train, your flight, your boat. You&#8217;ll get countless flat tires, your chain will break and your bike will get stolen. You&#8217;ll go for days without a shower, be forced to sleep on the ground for weeks on end, and your clothes will fall apart. People will treat you like a homeless bum; Passing motorists will yell at you; And you&#8217;ll be questioned about your religion, political beliefs and nationality over and over again. You&#8217;ll lose your wallet and your money. Border officials won&#8217;t let you through. You&#8217;ll get food poisoning and spend a week in bed. Your riding partner will quit on you. You&#8217;ll get bad news from home. And you&#8217;ll be hungry for days, weeks and months on end.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yes, it&#8217;s true: Bicycle touring can be difficult!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Okay, maybe all that stuff won&#8217;t happen to you on your travels&#8230; but some of it actually will.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is a misconception amongst many that traveling by bike is a stress-free stroll in the park. The images often times used to promote bicycle travel show a young healthy couple slowly coasting down a lonely country road as the sun glistens in the distance and a rainbow beams overhead. The image makes one think that traveling by bike is just about as easy and carefree as life can get.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately, self-supported bicycle touring is hardly ever like that. In fact, traveling long distances by bike can be really, really difficult at times.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over the past ten years I&#8217;ve put myself through a lot of pain and misery on my bike trips. I&#8217;ve gotten horrible cases of poison oak. I&#8217;ve been hospitalized after having a severe allergic reaction to a snake bite. I&#8217;ve been present when another cyclist was hit from behind by a passing vehicle going 55 miles per hour. I&#8217;ve been forced to sleep in two inches of water. I&#8217;ve been hit on my creepy homosexual men. I&#8217;ve had batteries thrown at me by passing motorists. I&#8217;ve been attacked in my tent at night while I was asleep. I&#8217;ve ridden over countless hills and mountains that beat me to my core. I&#8217;ve become super depressed and wanted to quit at least a thousand times. And despite all this, I find myself coming back to bicycle travel time and time again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The reason I bring this up is because I want you to understand that traveling by bike is not always easy. There are times when traveling by bike can be difficult, dirty, dangerous and demoralizing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve received way too many emails from people who set out on their first bike trip only to turn around after a day or two because they quickly realized just how difficult it can be to travel long distances on a bike. I don&#8217;t want that to happen to you!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I spoke recently about the <a title="Three bicycle touring hurdles" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/overcome-travel-hurdles-bicycle-touring/">three major hurdles</a> that the long-distance bicycle traveler needs to overcome, I discussed in great detail some of the common obstacles that bicycle travelers come up against while out on the road&#8230; and I gave some advice for overcoming those particular hurdles. If you haven&#8217;t already watched the <a title="bicycle touring is difficult" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/overcome-travel-hurdles-bicycle-touring/">recording of that event</a>, I recommend you do so now.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The reason I bring this up is because I don&#8217;t want you to be delusional about the reality of bicycle travel. Yes, you will have some incredible moments on your bike trip. You&#8217;ll visit amazing places. You&#8217;ll meet incredibly kind people. You&#8217;ll make friends that last a lifetime. You&#8217;ll learn about yourself, the people you meet and the places you visit. You&#8217;ll enjoy time with others&#8230; and you&#8217;ll enjoy time alone. Heck! You might even see a rainbow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All of these positive things will happen if you simply give bike travel a try. But you shouldn&#8217;t be ignorant to the fact that the bad stuff very often times accompanies the good.</p>
