<h1>Down The Road In South America: Book Review</h1>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9100" title="down-the-road-in-south-america" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/12/down-the-road-in-south-amer.jpg" alt="bicycle touring book by tim and cindy travis" width="300" height="450" />In their first book, <a title="The Road That Has No End book review" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/the-road-that-has-no-end-book-review/" target="_blank"><em>The Road That Has No End</em></a>, Tim and Cindie Travis left their normal lives in Prescott, Arizona and took off to travel around the world on their bicycles. Their second book, <em>Down The Road In South America: A Bicycle Tour through Poverty, Paradise, and the Places in Between</em>, is the story of their travels through the South American countries of Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>Unlike their first book, however, which is largely about their struggle to adapt to their new nomadic lifestyle, <a title="Down the road bicycle touring in south america" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0975442732?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bicycletouringpro-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0975442732" target="_blank"><em>Down The Road In South America</em></a>, is a story more about what it was like for this traveling couple to truly LIVE on the road for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>What I found most interesting about the couple&#8217;s first book is how they saved up, worked hard, and planned out their epic dive into nomadic living, as this is a lifestyle choice few people will likely ever make.</p>
<p>Because they had already been on the road for months by the time they even started writing about the happenings inside <em>Down The Road In South America</em>, the book lacks any of that &#8220;hit the road and ditch our normal lives&#8221; appeal. Instead, it&#8217;s an ordinary travel book about two cyclists roaming about in numerous South American countries.</p>
<p>For me, the book as a whole was good, but there was nothing spectacular about it. Tim falls and injures his knee. The couple gets robbed. And both cyclists suffer with diarrhea and fatigue.</p>
<p>The thing about traveling is that, often times, all of the exciting and memorable moments happen at the beginning. After a while, even the most seemingly epic tales, places and people tend to become ordinary and routine.</p>
<p>And that, I fear, is what happened with Tim and Cindie&#8217;s second book. The best part of their story (breaking away from their lives in Arizona) was recorded in <em>The Road That Has No End </em>and this part of their advnture makes for a thrilling read. But once they&#8217;re on the road, the Travis&#8217; story is no different than anyone else traveling through South America (despite the fact that they are on bicycles instead of getting about by plane, bus or automobile).</p>
<p>Overall, <em><a title="south america bike riding book" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0975442732?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bicycletouringpro-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0975442732" target="_blank">Down The Road In South America</a> </em>is a great record of the Travis&#8217; adventures and it might make for a educational read for someone wishing to following a similar route through South America. But if you&#8217;re looking for a book that leaves you with a memorable lasting impression of South America, it&#8217;s people, and the places that make the continent so spectacular, then this probably isn&#8217;t it.</p>
