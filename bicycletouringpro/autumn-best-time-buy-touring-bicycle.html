<p>Winter is coming, and that means many people around the world are putting <a href="http://www.wintercyclingbook.com" class="broken_link">snow tires</a> on their bikes, <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/bike-racks-for-garage/">hanging up their bicycles entirely and storing them away in their garages</a>, or simply daydreaming about warmer weather.</p>
<p>But autumn isn&#8217;t just a good time to hang up your bicycle and prepare for the winter months ahead. In fact, autumn is actually one of the best times of year to buy a new touring bicycle!</p>
<p>Inside my best-selling book, <strong>“<a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/touring-bicycles-buyers-guide/">The Essential Guide To Touring Bicycles</a>,”</strong> I not only explain the difference between touring bikes and so many of the other types of bicycles you currently see for sale in your local bike shops (such as road bikes, mountain bikes, hybrids, beach cruisers, etc.), but I also explain why autumn is the absolute best time to buy a new touring bicycle.</p>
<p>Autumn (or fall, depending on what you prefer to call it) is a great time to buy a touring bicycle because:</p>
<p>First of all, <strong>if you want to have a new touring bike by spring or summertime, you need to order your new bike now!</strong> Many touring bicycle manufacturers are small and hand-build their touring bicycles and/or need lots of time to buy the parts, assemble your bike and get it fitted together for you perfectly.</p>
<p>Because of this, many touring bike manufacturers require that you order your bike as early as three to six months in advance! If you wait until spring to order your new bike, you might not get it until the end of summer! This is why, if you want to order a very specific bicycle (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqhYcevd44c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">such as a custom-made bike like my Siskiyou touring bicycle from <em>Co-Motion Cycles</em></a>), now is the perfect time to do it!</p>
<p>Order your touring bicycle in the fall and your new bike will be waiting for you by the time you&#8217;re ready to start riding it in the spring.</p>
<p>Secondly, <strong>autumn is a great time to purchase a new touring bicycle because most bicycle manufacturers are preparing to bring their new bikes in for the following year. This means they are desperately trying to get rid of the models they currently have on hand. And because they&#8217;re so desperate to move their existing touring bicycles, bike shops and bicycle manufacturers alike will oftentimes drop the price of their touring bike models in the fall.</strong></p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re willing to wait until the end of the year (when bike sales are slow), you can save yourself hundreds of dollars on a new touring bicycle.</p>
<p>For example, I recently saw a <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=32247&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F109339%2Fco-op-cycles-adv-31-bike" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1,100 USD touring bike on sale at an REI store in Arizona for only $750 USD</a>. These kinds of deals aren&#8217;t always easy to find, but if you do a little digging (and calling around), it&#8217;s possible to save yourself $200-$500 USD or more off the regular retail price of your next touring bicycle by simply purchasing it in the autumn.</p>
<p>October, November and even December are great times to buy a new touring bicycle! So, what are you waiting for?</p>
<p>To learn more about touring bicycles and flip through a database of more than 80 of the world&#8217;s most popular touring bike models, pick up a copy of “<strong>The Essential Guide To Touring Bicycles</strong>.” It&#8217;s available on <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2hAzIDT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon.com</a> </em>and here at <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em>: <a href="https://www.bicycletouringpro.com/touringbikebook" class="broken_link">https://www.bicycletouringpro.com/touringbikebook</a></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve decided on your dream touring bicycle, make the phone call to your local dealer and place your order ASAP! Don&#8217;t wait until spring or summer when everyone else is trying to buy their new touring bike at the very last minute. Use the autumn to your advantage. Order your new bike today and save yourself hundreds of dollars in the process!</p>
