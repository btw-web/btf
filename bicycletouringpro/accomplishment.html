<h1>Bicycle Touring Might Be Your Most Rewarding Accomplishment This Year</h1>
<p>Would you like to accomplish something <em><strong>GREAT</strong></em> this year? Something that challenges you, makes you feel good and is so incredibly rewarding that you will remember it for the rest of your life?</p>
<p>If that sounds like something you want for yourself&#8230; then I&#8217;m here to encourage you, right now, to start planning and preparing for your own <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/what-exactly-is-bicycle-touring/">bicycle touring</a> adventure!</p>
<p><iframe width="920" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJctUEUVdNw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For the last 19 years I have been traveling around the world on a bicycle&#8230; and for the last 11 years I have been teaching other people how to travel long-distances by bike. (If you haven&#8217;t done so already, you should really <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/book/">read my book</a> or <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/video/">sign-up for my how-to bike tour video training course</a> and start planning your dream bike tour today.)</p>
<p><strong>I love bicycle touring</strong>&#8230; and I have experienced many personal benefits from traveling long-distances on my bicycle, but one of the best things about bike touring is the fact that it is a goal that almost anyone can accomplish.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. <span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>Conducting an overnight bike tour of your own is something YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH!</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>If you can ride a bicycle, you can go bicycle touring&#8230; and you will be surprised at just how far you can go when you put your mind to it.</strong></p>
<p>Now, as I&#8217;m writing this, we are ringing in a New Year&#8230; and this is a time of year when a lot of people like to talk about goal setting.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m personally a huge goal setter. Goal setting is how I accomplished my first bike tour at age 17&#8230; and it&#8217;s how I was able to take my dream of becoming a professional cyclist and turn it into a reality. Setting a goal and then slowly working toward accomplishing that goal is how you accomplish big things in life.</p>
<p>But one of the things about goal setting is&#8230; it isn&#8217;t always easy!</p>
<p>Sometimes you can spend months or even years working toward a big life goal and not get any closer to making that thing happen. In addition to that, sometimes it&#8217;s difficult to even measure whether or not you&#8217;re getting any closer to your goal.</p>
<p>But bicycle touring isn&#8217;t like that!!!</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Participating a multi-day bike touring adventure is something that almost anyone can accomplish <strong>because measuring your progress on a bicycle tour is easy.</strong> </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy because, as long as you are able to cycle even 1 mile (or 1 kilometer) on any given day, you are moving closer toward your goal (the finish line for your bike tour)&#8230; and you can actually measure your progress on a map.</p>
<p>Here, for example, is a screenshot from the Maps.me offline mapping application I use to navigate on my smartphone. This is from a <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/saint-james-bike-tour/">bike tour I conducted this past summer in Portugal in Spain</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-40701" src="https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/portugal-progress-bike-tour-1-896x498.jpg" alt="mapping your bike tour progress" width="896" height="498" srcset="https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/portugal-progress-bike-tour-1-896x498.jpg 896w, https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/portugal-progress-bike-tour-1-600x333.jpg 600w, https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/portugal-progress-bike-tour-1-900x500.jpg 900w, https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/portugal-progress-bike-tour-1-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/portugal-progress-bike-tour-1.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px" /></p>
<p>Look at the map and you will see that I started the bike tour in Porto, Portugal and then began cycling north up the coastline with the goal of reaching Santiago de Compostella, Spain by the end of the week.</p>
<p>As you can see, I made quick progress on the first day of the bike tour. Day two was another substantial day of cycling. Day 3 wasn&#8217;t nearly as far, but day four was a solid day in the saddle. Day 5 was incredibly short, but I still made forward progress. And on day 6 I completed the bike tour by cycling the final leg into the city of Santiago de Compostella. Hurray!</p>
<p>The distances here don&#8217;t really matters. What matters is that <span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>my forward progress on this particular bike tour could be visibly seen, mapped and measured. As long as I kept moving forward, it was obvious that I was getting closer and closer to my final goal</strong></span>&#8230; and after only six days of cycling, I had done it! I had cycled all the way from Porto, Portugal to Santiago de Compostella.</p>
<p><strong>MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!</strong></p>
<p>This is what I love about bicycle touring: Setting a goal, moving slowly toward that goal, measuring my progress along the way, eventually reaching that goal, and then being able to look back and see just how far I have come.</p>
<p><strong>Bike touring is a great example of how powerful setting a goal can be and then working, day by day, to get closer and closer to that goal.</strong></p>
<p>If only all goals in life were so easy!</p>
<p>If only all goals in life could be mapped out so obviously!</p>
<p>If only all goals in life could be charted and physically measured!</p>
<p>As the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> (the world&#8217;s leading expert on bike travel and personal coach to thousands of people all around the world), <span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>I hope that you will set the goal of conducting your own bicycle touring this year</strong></span>&#8230; and I hope that the <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/blog/">articles</a>, <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/book/">books</a>, <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/video/">courses</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bicycle-touring-pro/id1254236583">podcasts</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/bicycletouringpro/videos">videos</a> I have created here at <a href="https://www.bicycletouringpro.com">www.bicycletouringpro.com</a> will help you to get you out on a bike tour of your own this year while removing all the guesswork, wasted time and frustration that plagues so many first-time bicycle travelers.</p>
