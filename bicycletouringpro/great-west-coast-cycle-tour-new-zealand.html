<h3>The Great West Coast Cycle</h3>
<p>Known as New Zealand&#8217;s most famous and scenic multi-day cycle ride, this spectacular trip from Christchurch to Queenstown is also regarded as one of the world&#8217;s top five cycle touring routes.</p>
<p>Your adventure begins with a memorable journey on the TranzAlpine Express train to Greymouth via the spectacular Waimakariri Gorge and lush forests of Arthur&#8217;s Pass National Park.</p>
<p>Then the riding begins with daily rides of up to 100 km and many high alpine pass crossings (including the spectacular Haast Pass). The cycling on this bike tour will take you past an ever-changing landscape; from glacier country through to quiet sealed roads fringed with mighty podocarp rainforest and past dramatic coastlines.</p>
<p>Near the end of the bike tour, you will cross over the Crown Range into the beautiful Southern Lakes district around the cities of Wanaka and Queenstown.</p>
<p>There is a free day built into the tour for you to enjoy the many optional activities at the Franz Josef Glacier, such as relaxing in the hot pools, enjoying guided walks or taking an optional scenic flight.</p>

<p class="XSLTripBody reviewText">Wonderful trip in every way: itinerary, challenging climbs, guides, accommodations, bike rentals, additional activities, included meals, and compatible group.</p>

<h3>Important Things To Know</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>This bike tour is not for beginners</strong>. You will need to be an experienced road rider with a good level of fitness. You should be able to cycle comfortably for up to 4-6 hours (or around 80-100km/50-60miles per day), with some uphill riding. There are some long days and some steep sections. You should be confident riding on main roads &#8211; alongside traffic which can be traveling at high speed.</li>
<li><strong>Enjoy a journey on the TranzAlpine Train. </strong>This trip includes a trip on one of the great train journeys of the world through New Zealand’s Southern Alps. Along this journey you’ll see epic vistas, travel the edges of the ice-fed Waimakariri River, traverse the Southern Alps, and see miles of native beech forest from Christchurch to the West Coast.</li>
<li><strong>The tour is fully-supported</strong> and if, at any stage, you feel like having a rest from the cycling, you will be able to ride in the support vehicle. No problem whatsoever!</li>
<li>In addition to the cycling, you&#8217;ll also have the opportunity to explore the cities of Wanaka and Queenstown</li>
</ul>
