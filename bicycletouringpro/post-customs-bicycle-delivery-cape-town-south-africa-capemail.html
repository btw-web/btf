<p>I recently wrote <a title="how to mail a bicycle" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/mailing-a-bicycle-from-one-country-to-another-good-idea-or-bad/">a long article about how I mailed my bicycle</a> from Poznan, Poland to Cape Town, South Africa and explained why I mailed the bike, how the process worked, and what happened when the bike was finally &#8220;delivered&#8221; when it reached it&#8217;s final destination. Here are some additional photos from that day.</p>
<p>Anthony, the driver from the <a title="African Bikers tour photos blog" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/african-bikers-mountain-bike-tour-day-1/"><em>African Bikers</em> mountain bike tour</a>, was kind enough to offer to drive me to the <em>Capemail</em> customs office in Epping, South Africa and he went into the office with me while his girlfriend, Tanya, waited in the car.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-19650" alt="IMG_4339" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4339-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p>After picking up my bike, we drove to a nearby casino where I first had to remove the knife from my backpack and take it back to the car. Then security told me I could not wear my baseball hat (they wanted to be able to see my face on the security cameras), and then when I asked Anthony to take a picture of me playing slots with South African Rand, a woman in security ran over and told me I had to delete the photo from my camera. I hit the back button on the camera, pretending that the photo had been deleted, but it really had not. Thus, the photo below.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-19651" alt="IMG_4345" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4345-588x392.jpg" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p>Anthony and Tanya and I ate lunch at a Steak/Mexican restaurant inside the casino (I had a quesadilla and was surprized when Tanya told me she had never heard of Albert Einstein or his famous formula: E = MC2). I paid for lunch, just to thank the young couple for driving me to the customs office and helping me out. Without them, it would have taken me a full day to find the office, put my bike back together and then ride it across Cape Town back to the hostel where I was staying.</p>

<p>Anthony then dropped me off at the Green Elephant hostel in Observatory and later that night I put my bicycle back together again. It felt great to finally have my bicycle back in my possession.</p>
