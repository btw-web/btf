<p>On April 4, 2014, I cycled to Oxnard, California and met up with Johnny from <em><a title="Milestone Rides - bicycle blog" href="http://milestonerides.com/about-us/" target="_blank">Milestone Rides</a></em> who was, at the time time, in the process of leaving his job and working to become a full-time cyclist (like myself). As you can imagine, he had quite a few questions for me about how I made the leap from being a passionate bicycle touring fan to a full-time professional bicycle traveler.</p>
<p>During our time together in both Oxnard and Camarillo, Johnny and I cycled to the nearby CSUCI University and ate lunch together at a nearby Mexican restaurant. During our time together, Johnny and I spoke about our bike tours, out experiences with the <em>Adventure Cycling Association</em>, and our dreams for the future.</p>
<p>Before we went our separate ways, Johnny sat down and did a quick interview with me about my own bicycle touring experiences, asking me:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did you first get started with bicycle touring?</li>
<li><a title="What to pack for a bike tour" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/book/">What is the best way to figure out what gear to carry on your bike tours and what items you should leave at home?</a></li>
<li>What strange or silly items are you carrying with you on your current bike tours?</li>
<li>Are the things you pack for every bike tour the same? Or different?</li>
<li>Why do you choose to travel without a camp stove?</li>
<li>How do you pick the destinations for your bike tours?</li>
<li>What inspired you to go on your first bike tour? And what is it now that continues to motivate you to travel by bike?</li>
<li>How is it possible for you to travel for months on end?</li>
<li>At what point did you decide to become a professional bicycle tourist?</li>
<li>Where are you going on your next cycle tour?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Here&#8217;s a quick transcript of the video above:</h3>
<p><em>On April 4, 2014, Johnny (from Milestone Rides) traveled to Camarillo, California for a quick bike ride and interview with Darren Alff of BicycleTouringPro.com.</em></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have anybody teaching me how to do this. My uncle had gone on a bike tour before and he showed me how to put the bags on the bike, but he didn&#8217;t really tell me <a title="what to pack for a cycle tour" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/book/">what to pack or anything</a>. So I&#8217;ve kind of figured that out over the years. You go on a trip and carry a bunch of stuff you never use. And then you come home and say, &#8220;I carried this thing around with me on my bicycle for a whole month and I never used it.&#8221; And then you go on another trip and you say, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave that thing at home.&#8221; So that&#8217;s pretty much it. Almost every year I usually bring something that I end up not using, but it&#8217;s a new item that I think, &#8220;I&#8217;ll try this out and maybe I&#8217;ll use it.&#8221; On my upcoming bike tour I&#8217;m planning to bring a kite and a <a title="cycle touring packing list" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/packing-list-2014-europe-asia/">ping-pong paddle</a>, so we&#8217;ll see if I ever use any of these items.</p>
<p><em>Are the things you pack usually the same?</em></p>
<p>Never! I never pack exactly the same things on my bike tours.</p>
<p><em>So, what goes into packing for a bicycle tour?</em></p>
<p>Well, there are <a title="bicycle touring basics" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/book/">the basics you need for a bike tour</a>. Camping gear is essential for me, because I spend so much time camping. And clothing changes a little bit depending on where you are going in the world (and what time of year you are traveling), but it is the personal items that probably change the most.</p>
<p>On my early bike tours I brought a camp stove and pot and cooking gear and everything, but in the last few years I don&#8217;t bring all that stuff any more. That&#8217;s one of the things that I though, &#8220;I&#8217;ll try going without it,&#8221; and then realized I don&#8217;t really need this cooking gear at all. I do miss it sometimes, but not enough to be carrying it around with me all the time.</p>
<p><em>How do you organize your bike tours? How do you pick the destinations for your travels?</em></p>
<p>I pick the destinations based on where I want to go.</p>
<p><em>So, it&#8217;s usually a matter of going to a place you&#8217;ve never been to before?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s usually it. I&#8217;m just interested in a place for whatever reason&#8230; and I think every tour has been different. I mean, what motivated me on my first bike tour is very different from what motivates me now. My first bike tour I did when I was 17-years-old, so at that age I was leaving home for the first time in my life and I was trying to prove to myself that I could do something big and memorable on my own. Maybe I was trying to prove that to myself for the first couple years of my bicycle travels &#8211; that I could do this in various locations all around the world.</p>
<p><em>What is your motivation now when you&#8217;re touring?</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good one. I don&#8217;t know. I guess, maybe, trying to figure out where I belong, to a certain extent. When you&#8217;re from a certain area and that is all you know&#8230; like, I grew up here in Ventura County, California, but I don&#8217;t really feel at home here now that I&#8217;ve traveled all over the world. I think there are other places where I felt like I connected more with the people or something else. So that&#8217;s kind of what I look at now&#8230; is like, &#8220;Could I live here?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>You&#8217;ve been doing this for a while?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, 14 years.</p>
<p><em>14 years! Wow. And you get to go on these long trips. So, how is that possible for you to take an extensive leave from work? Or how did you get that going?</em></p>
<p>My main secret is that you just have to be stubborn. You just have to be obsessed with what you want to do. That&#8217;s the main thing. And then continuously work towards that.</p>
<p>For me, I think the big move that I made occurred a couple years after I graduated from college. I had been going on bike tours for six years at that point. And during those six years I had been telling myself, &#8220;I wish I could just travel the world and get paid to do that.&#8221; All my friends would say, &#8220;Good luck with that. You&#8217;re dreaming!&#8221; But when I finally made the commitment to myself that I was going to try and do that, that was really all it took. You gotta make the decision and go for it!</p>
<p><em>I know you have a couple of cycle tours coming up. Can you tell me the details for what you have going on?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. I am leaving soon on a <a title="2014 bicycle touring pro route plans" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/my-updated-bike-touring-plans-for-2014/">6-month-long bike tour through about 13 different countries in Europe and Asia.</a> I might be longer than that actually. I don&#8217;t even know. I&#8217;ve rented out my entire home for a whole year, so I know I&#8217;m going for the six months and then I have some time afterward.</p>
<p>I like going back to places you&#8217;ve been to before. You see it differently&#8230; and at the same time, you kind of feel at home. It&#8217;s kinda cool.</p>
<p>Thank you Johnny and <em><a title="Milestone Rides" href="http://milestonerides.com/" target="_blank">Milestone Rides</a></em> for coming out to meet me in Camarillo and for taking the time to interview me and post this video. I really appreciate it!</p>
