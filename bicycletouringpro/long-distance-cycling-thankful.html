<h1>Bicycle Touring Teaches You To Be Thankful</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in life and obsess over the things you don&#8217;t have, the experiences you&#8217;ve been unable to make or the relationships you&#8217;ve been unable to forge. While thinking about what you DON&#8217;T have may be easy&#8230; it&#8217;s important that you sit back every once and a while and appreciate the things you DO HAVE to be thankful for.</p>

<p>Riding a bicycle around the world has taught me a lot about thankfulness&#8230; and it&#8217;s made me realize that even when I&#8217;m all alone, on the other side of the world, with nothing but my bicycle, my camping equipment, a few articles of clothing and a pocket full of food, I still have a whole world of things to be thankful for.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m thankful for my bicycle, which acts as my vehicle, my gym membership and my entertainment on a daily basis.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thankful for my clothing, which keeps me dry and keep me warm.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thankful for my tent, sleeping bag and sleeping mat, which together acts as my home out on the road and, at night, shields me from darkness and bad weather.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thankful to have access to clean drinking water, because I&#8217;ve experienced parts of the world where clean water is so hard to find, and I know how difficult that makes it to simply life a normal life.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thankful for what little food I have, for my next meal gives me something to look forward to&#8230; and I know that the food I carry now will give me the energy I need to get me to my watering hole/food stop/supermarket.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thankful for the people I meet on my travels, because they make me feel less alone and give me things to think about as I ride.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thankful for the fact that I get to have such a unique experience and see the world in a way that very few people will ever get to.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thankful for my health and the fact that I&#8217;m in good enough shape to ride my bicycle long distances and push my body in difficult ways.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thankful for the weather &#8211; good, bad or ugly &#8211; because the weather is a constant reminder to enjoy the good moments and see beauty in difficult times.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thankful for the hills and mountains, because they challenge me on the climbs and bring me joy on the ride down.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thankful for technology, because even though I&#8217;m far from home, I can easily text, email, message or even call/video chat with my friends and family back home.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m thankful to be out in the fresh air, knowing that I could be, like so many others, stuck in an office somewhere, staring at a computer screen for days on end.</li>
<li>And I&#8217;m thankful for all of these experiences, because I know that my life is short and I won&#8217;t be able to do this forever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Long-distance cycling reminds you to be thankful for the little things, because those seemingly small things are usually THE MOST IMPORTANT things.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the little things you have to be thankful for. Those little things aren&#8217;t so little when you don&#8217;t have them any more. So, please: next time you go out on a long bike ride, take some time to sit back and think about all the things you have in your life to be thankful for!</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><strong>Need a daily reminder to be thankful?</strong></span> Consider downloading the &#8220;<em><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=journal.gratitude.com.gratitudejournal&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Presently</a></em>&#8221; app. It&#8217;s a totally free app that reminds you every day to take a few moments and write down the things you&#8217;re thankful for.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using the <em>Presently</em> app for nearly a year now and it has helped me a lot to not only boost my mood and remind me to be thankful for all that I have, but it also serves as a sort of journal, because it allows me to look back on the entire year and quickly skim through all the things I said I was thankful/grateful for.</p>
<hr />
<p>While we&#8217;re talking about THANKFULNESS, <strong>let me take a moment to THANK YOU</strong> for your support of my work here at <a href="https://www.bicycletouringpro.com"><em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em></a>. Because without you, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to write the hundreds of articles I have written, produce the dozens of podcast episodes I&#8217;ve produced, or shoot and edit the hundreds of videos I have published on the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Your support means the world to me and it is a big part of what keeps me going!</p>
<p>I also want to thank the individuals who have made <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/patrons">monetary donations to <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em></a> this year. There&#8217;s really only a few handfuls of you, but I want to thank you all for your support. Whether you donated $10 or $100 or more, I can&#8217;t tell you how much your support means to me&#8230; and the contributions you have made have gone a long way toward keeping the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> website up and running.</p>
<p>This has been a tough year, but like with bicycle touring, the tough times teach you to be thankful for what you have.</p>
<p>So, thank you&#8230; thank you&#8230; thank you. There&#8217;s so much to be thankful for&#8230; and I am thankful for YOU!</p>
