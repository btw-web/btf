<p>In the summer of 2012, I traveled to <a title="Iceland bicycle touring information" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/?s=Iceland">Iceland</a> with my friend and ex-college Roommate, Brandon Roesler.</p>
<p>Brandon and I sat next to each other in a Freshman English class, became roommates the following semester, and stayed close friends throughout our college education.</p>
<p>Throughout our college years, I spent my summers bicycle touring across the United States and Canada. And after I graduated from university, I started cycling in foreign countries all around the world. I tried to get Brandon to join me on my bike tours on several occasions, but for whatever reason, I could never get him to fully commit.</p>
<p>Which is why it surprised me a little, when more than a decade after our first meeting, Brandon called me up and said he was ready to join me on <a title="cost of traveling in iceland" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/traveling-in-iceland-how-much-does-it-cost/">a bike tour in Iceland</a>.</p>
<p>During our first couple days in the country, Brandon and I met a French bicycle traveler named Calite who joined up for part of the tour. Adding a third individual to our group made the bike tour in Iceland even more special.</p>
<p>While I’d love to say that cycling in Iceland with Brandon was a totally positive experience, the truth is&#8230; it was a fairly challenging time. Brandon hurt his knee during the first day on the bike, my face swelled up on several occasions (due to dehydration &#8211; I think), and it was cold, windy and miserable for a great deal of the ride.</p>
<p>But we pressed on and we survived. We spent 25 days cycling around the country and I was impressed by Brandon’s abilities. He was strong, despite the obstacles we encountered, and he was constantly making me laugh.</p>
<p>Looking back on our Iceland bike tour now, I’m not sure if Brandon enjoyed his time in the country. We&#8217;ve only exchanged a few short Facebook messages since the trip ended almost three whole years ago.</p>
<p>So while I can&#8217;t speak for Brandon, I know that for me at least, it was an overall positive experience. Yes, I was cold and miserable at times. And yes, we got on each others nerves. But I think that when I look back on the experience now, the cold and wind and pain has disappeared from my memory, and all that remains is a bike ride with a friend in a beautiful, isolated, and stunning land.</p>
