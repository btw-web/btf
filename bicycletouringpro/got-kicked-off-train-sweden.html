<h1>I Got Kicked Off A Train In Sweden!!!</h1>

<p>That&#8217;s right! During one of the last days of <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/biking-across-norway-sweden/">my 2015 bike tour across Europe</a>, I was forced to travel by train&#8230; and things didn&#8217;t go according to plan. Watch the video above and you&#8217;ll hear the story of how I was kicked off a train in Sweden&#8230; and how I ran into numerous other problems on that same day.</p>
<p>In the video you&#8217;ll hear how:</p>
<ul>
<li>My credit cards wouldn&#8217;t work on the train&#8217;s mobile credit card machine.</li>
<li>A cute Swedish girl offers to pay for my train fare.</li>
<li>The train company lets me ride part-way for free.</li>
<li>I run around a city I&#8217;ve never been to before &#8211; searching for an ATM machine.</li>
<li>All of my debt cards (not my credit cards) expired on the same day.</li>
<li>I find a currency exchange office and get the cash I need with just seconds to spare.</li>
<li>I pay for my train ticket&#8230; and then get asked to leave the train.</li>
<li>I get locked inside a bus station and have the police called on me.</li>
<li>Plus, a whole lot more!</li>
</ul>
<p>In hindsight, yes, I could have prevented some of these issues with some more advanced planning, etc&#8230; but when you&#8217;re traveling for years on end, you can&#8217;t always plan every little step along the way. Sometimes you just have to pull up to a train station in the mountains of western Sweden with your fully-loaded touring bicycle and that you can make it to your destination on time. It doesn&#8217;t always work out that way (as this story proves), but you do the best you can.</p>

<p>Have you ever had a similar experience when traveling with your bicycle on a train? Or maybe you&#8217;ve had issues when traveling with foreign credit/debt cards? I bet you&#8217;ve never been locked in a bus station before, have you?
