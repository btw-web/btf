<h1>Bicycle Touring Pro Travel Scholarship &#8211; 2012 Finalists</h1>
<p>2012 marks the third year of the <a title="Bicycle Touring Pro travel scholarship" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/scholarship/"><em>Bicycle Touring Pro Travel Scholarship</em></a> &#8211; which was created in order to give small micro-grants to young, first-time bicycle travelers. As someone who started bicycle touring at the age of 17, and with very little money in my bank account, I know that just a small amount of money can go a very long way when put in the right hands&#8230; and that is that the BTN Travel Scholarship is all about.</p>
<p>This year, I&#8217;ve narrowed down the list of scholarship finalists to just 20 individuals, whom you can read about below. With applicants from all around the world, their travel plans vary greatly, but all of them have one thing in common &#8211; the goal of traveling by bike at some point this year.</p>
<p>Be sure to read through the list of finalists below and then come back to <em>BicycleTouringPro.com</em> on April 2, 2012 to find out which of these twenty individuals will be selected as this year&#8217;s recipient of the<em> Bicycle Touring Pro Travel Scholarship</em>.</p>
