<h1>7 Things To Do In Nazca, Peru (That Don’t Involve Flying Over The Nazca Lines)</h1>
<p>People who travel to the small desert town of Nazca, Peru usually stay for only one day &#8211; just long enough to take a flight over the mysterious <a title="what are the nazca lines" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_lines" target="_blank">Nazca, Lines</a>&#8230; and then they jump on a bus and head out of town. But there&#8217;s a whole lot more to do in Nazca than simply flying over these mysterious line drawings.</p>
<p>The following is a list of 7 things I recommend you do while in Nazca, Peru that don&#8217;t involve <a title="flying over the nazca lnes" href="http://darrenalff.com/nazca-lines-death-flight/" target="_blank">flying over the Nazca Lines</a>.</p>
<h3>View The Nazca Lines From The Ground</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9155" title="nazca peru observation-tower" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2011/01/nazca-peru-observation-tower-588x391.jpg" alt="see the nazca lines from the ground" width="659" height="438" /></p>
<p>Okay. Okay. If you insist on seeing the Nazca Lines, but you don&#8217;t want to see them from the air, you can always catch a bus or taxi up the Pan-American highway a few kilometers and stop at the Nazca Lines observation tower. The tower, which sits right along the side of the highway isn&#8217;t really all that tall, but it allows you to get a close-up look at a few of the nearby figures and massive desert lines.</p>
<h3>Stroll Through The Sunday Market</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9154" title="sunday-market" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2011/01/sunday-market-588x383.jpg" alt="people at the sunday market in nazca peru" width="660" height="430" /></p>
<p>On Sundays the people of Nazca come together on the city&#8217;s north-east side for a massive food and clothing sale. Here you can find all kinds of fruits, vegetables, meat, and cheap sunglasses, clothes, and illegal DVDs for sale. Even if you don&#8217;t buy anything, the market is large enough that it makes for a fun half-day adventure &#8211; even if you do nothing but stroll around and take photos of the people you encounter.</p>
<h3>See The Mummies Of Chauchilla Cemetery</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9152" title="nazca mummy feet" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2011/01/nazca-mummy-feet-588x391.jpg" alt="the mummified feet on an ancient peruvian baby" width="659" height="438" /></p>
<p>30 kms south of Nazca is the Chauchilla Cemetery, where dozens of mummified bodies are on display. While most people think of Egypt as the land of the mummies, Peru has a surprising number of mummified bodies on display&#8230; and the <a title="chauchilla cemetary nazca peru" href="http://darrenalff.com/touring-mummies-chauchilla-cemetery/" target="_blank">Chauchilla Cemetery</a> is one of the best places to see them. While a few of the mummies here are covered and in protective cases, most of the bodies are out in the open, which gives you a super unique way of viewing these ancient corpses.</p>
<h3>Walk To The Pardeones Ruins</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9151" title="nazca-pardeones" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2011/01/nazca-pardeones-588x391.jpg" alt="pardeones ruins near nazca peru" width="659" height="438" /></p>
<p>2 kms south of Nazca are the Pardeones Ruins &#8211; a small site where the crumbling remains of an ancient village can be seen. The site itself isn&#8217;t all that impressive, and it&#8217;s certainly not worth the 10 SOL entrance price, but an excursion to Pardeones makes for a nice walk out of town&#8230; and if you arrive there after 5 PM, there&#8217;s a good chance the guard will be gone and you can enter the ruins at no cost.</p>
<h3>Climb The Mountains Near Buene Fe</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9150" title="nazca sunset" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2011/01/nazca-sunset-588x391.jpg" alt="purple sunset near nazca peru" width="659" height="438" /></p>
<p>The Buene Fe geoglyphs are, like the Nazca Lines, a number of large lines and patterns drawn the dirt near the mountains of Nazca, Peru. You can walk to this site from Nazca (it&#8217;s about 5 kms) or you can take a taxi for just a few SOL. While the Buene Fe lines are not all that exciting, the mountains behind Beune Fe are magnificent&#8230; and if you time your stay just right, you might be treated to a sunset like the one you see above.</p>
<h3>Hit The Dunes On A 4&#215;4 Sandboarding Tour</h3>

<p>In the deserts surrounding the tiny town of Nazca are some impressive sand dunes&#8230; and if you like  motorized adventures, then a <a title="sandboarding in nazca peru" href="http://darrenalff.com/4x4-sandboarding-nazca-peru/" target="_blank">4&#215;4 Sandboarding Tour</a> is right up your alley. On this unique adventure you will ride along in an 8-person dune buggy (the more people on the tour with you, the less you pay). At first, you&#8217;ll be driven to the aqueducts of Ocongalla, the Ruins of Cahuachi (an ancient pyramid site), and finally you will visit a place where the bones of hundreds of people are simply scattered in the sand. After that, you&#8217;ll head out into the dunes for about an hour&#8217;s worth of Sandboarding, before jumping back in the dune buggy and heading home. Watch the video above to learn more.</p>
<h3>Rent A Bicycle And Explore The Nearby Deserts</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9153" title="nazca-mountain-bike" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2011/01/nazca-mountain-bike-588x391.jpg" alt="colorful mountain bicycle picture" width="659" height="438" /></p>
<p>Finally, consider renting a bicycle and exploring some of the nearby areas under your own human power. There aren&#8217;t any places in town that specialize in bicycle rentals, but you can usually find a tour company that will gladly round a bicycle up for you. Don&#8217;t expect too much from the bike that you rent, but grabbing yourself a bike, getting out of town, and exploring the nearby areas is certainly one fun thing to do when you&#8217;re in the tiny desert town of Nazca, Peru.</p>
<p>So there you have it! 7 things to do in Nazca, Peru that don&#8217;t involve flying over the mysterious Nazca Lines.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been to Nazca, Peru, what other things would you add to this list?</p>
