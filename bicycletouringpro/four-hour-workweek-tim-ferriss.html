<h1>Live Your Dream Life With &#8220;The 4-Hour Workweek&#8221;</h1>
<p>This is the book I recommend you read ►►► <a href="http://amzn.to/2cDJq6I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em></a> by Tim Ferriss</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2cuVwLS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-33579" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2016/09/4-hour-workweek-horizontal-book-cover-660x404.jpg" alt="The 4 Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss" width="660" height="404" /></a></p>
<p>For the last 17+ years, I&#8217;ve been traveling around the world on my bicycle. I&#8217;ve cycled across more than 50 different countries on 5 different continents and I&#8217;ve lived in dozens of different cities all around the world. I bought my own house at age 22, I drive a motorcycle (and a camper-van), and I own my own business.</p>
<p>Because of the way I live/travel, people are always asking me:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you finance your lifestyle?</li>
<li>Where do you get the money to go on so many incredible adventures?</li>
<li>What is the secret to traveling the world like you do?</li>
<li>Do you have sponsors that pay for your trips?</li>
<li>Are you (or your family) wealthy?</li>
</ul>
<p>The truth is, I am far from wealthy; I don&#8217;t have any sponsors; my parents have never given me money for my travels; and I have financed all of my bike tours on my own&#8230; in a very simple way.</p>
<p><strong>My big secret is this:</strong> When I was 17-years-old and a freshman in university, I started reading business books. I read hundreds of books about marketing, sales, finance, etc&#8230; and in those books I learned about something called &#8220;passive income.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Passive income</em> (according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_income" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wikipedia.org</em></a>) &#8220;is an income received on a regular basis, with little effort required to maintain it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some examples of passive income are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rent from property.</li>
<li>Interest from a bank account.</li>
<li>Royalties from publishing a book or from licensing a patent or other form of intellectual property, such as computer software product, music, etc.</li>
<li>Earnings from internet advertisements on websites.</li>
<li>Dividend and interest income from owning securities, such as stocks and bonds.</li>
<li>And earnings from a business that does not require direct involvement from the owner or merchant.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you work a job where you trade your time for money, you are not earning a passive income. Instead, you are earning an <em>active income &#8211;</em> because in order for you to get paid, you have to show up at work.</p>
<p><strong>I have never been interested in earning an active income!</strong> My focus, from the age of 17, has been to earn a passive income that will support the lifestyle I want to live. Because earning a passive income means you have more time to do the things you most want to do in life.</p>
<p>Earning a passive income isn&#8217;t easy though. With passive income, you put in a lot of time, effort and money in at the start of a project and then hope that the work you&#8217;ve done up front will pay off for you later down the road.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve created dozens of different passive income steams over the years, and this is how I&#8217;m able to sleep till noon, wake up, check my bank account and see that I&#8217;ve made several hundred dollars while I was asleep. It&#8217;s also how I can go on a 9-month-long bike tour in Europe and come home from that trip with more money in my bank account than when I first left home 9-months earlier.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t make a lot of money (compared to many of the people in my life), but the income I derive from the passive income sources I&#8217;ve created over the last 16+ years is enough for me to live on and do just about anything that I please.</p>
<p>As Tim Ferriss explains in his best-selling book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2cDJq6I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em></a>, &#8220;People don&#8217;t want to be millionaires &#8211; they want to experience what they believe only millions can buy. Ski chalets, butlers, and exotic travel often enter the picture. $1,000,000 in the bank isn&#8217;t the fantasy. The fantasy is the lifestyle of complete freedom it supposedly allows. The question is then, &#8216;How can one achieve the millionaire lifestyle of complete freedom without first having $1,000,000?'&#8221;</p>
<p>This is how I&#8217;ve approached my life. I don&#8217;t personally have a million dollars in the bank, but I do my best to live my life as though I do. This is how I bought my own house; how I&#8217;ve managed to travel the world; how I&#8217;ve spent several winters seasons skiing at high-end resorts; how I&#8217;ve made friends with world-class athletes, artists and musicians; and how I&#8217;ve done an bunch of other amazing things &#8211; all with very little money.</p>
<p>Tim Ferris was right &#8211; you don&#8217;t have to be a millionaire in order to live like one!</p>

<p>If you have not yet read <em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em>, this is the #1 book I recommend you read for learning how to make the money you need so you can go off and live the live you&#8217;ve always dreamed about.</p>
<p>Here are the points I&#8217;m trying to make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time is more valuable than money.</li>
<li>Passive income is better than active income.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t need to be a millionaire in order to live like one.</li>
