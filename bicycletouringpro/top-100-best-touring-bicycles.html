<p>A <strong>touring bicycle</strong> is a bicycle designed specifically for <a title="what is bicycle touring?" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/what-exactly-is-bicycle-touring/">bicycle touring</a> (also referred to as “cycle touring, bike touring, bike travel, bicycle travel, <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/adventure-cycling/">adventure cycling</a> and bike-packing”) &#8211; the act of riding a bicycle for days, weeks, months, or even years on end as you travel across entire cities, states, and countries under your own power (without the assistance of a motor).</p>
<p><a title="Let me help you find your ideal touring bicycle" href="http://www.touringbicyclebook.com"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26761" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2014/10/three-touring-bicycles.jpg" alt="bike shop where touring bicycles are sold" width="660" height="138" /></a></p>
<p>There are hundreds of different touring bicycles available to you. There are touring bicycles made for short day rides near your home; touring bicycles for fast, speedy and lightweight club-style cycling adventures; and touring bicycles made to carry you and your gear all the way around the world. No two touring bicycles are the same!</p>
<h3>The Best Touring Bicycles in the World</h3>
<p>This article contains a list of 100 of the world&#8217;s most popular touring bicycles, along with a photo and a short product description of that bike (usually from the manufacturer). <em>But be warned &#8211;</em> each of these touring bicycles has been designed for a specific purpose. While the bikes on this page may look similar to the untrained eye, there are a number of minute details that make each bicycle better equipped for a certain type of bicycle touring.</p>
<p>For example: Did you know that there are <a title="3 main types of bike tours" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/types-of-bicycle-tours/">three main types of bicycle tours</a> with more than <a title="list of bike tours" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/different-types-names-for-bicycle-touring/">a dozen different sub-types</a> under that? For each of those various types of bicycle tours, there is a corresponding type of touring bicycles.</p>
<p>For example, each touring bicycle on this page can be placed inside one or more of the following five categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commuting</li>
<li>Sport Touring</li>
<li>Light Touring</li>
<li>Road Touring</li>
<li>Off-Road Touring</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that a bicycle designed for short local day trips should probably not be used for a long-distance bicycle tour across an entire country or all the way around the world. And a bicycle made for off-road riding won&#8217;t last long if used alongside bicycles designed with fast, speedy sport touring in mind.</p>
<p>This is why it&#8217;s so important that you understand not only the different types of bicycle tours, but also the different types of touring bicycles and what they have been designed for, before you go out and purchase a touring bicycle for yourself. More details on this can be found inside <strong><a title="which touring bicycle should i buy" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/touring-bicycles-buyers-guide/"><em>The Essential Guide To Touring Bicycles</em></a></strong>.</p>

<h3>Touring Bicycles &#8211; What You Need To Know</h3>
<p>Sadly, most local bike shop owners don&#8217;t know much (or anything) about bicycle touring. Because bicycle touring is such a small niche within the cycling industry, local bike shops rarely ever focus any of their time, energy, or money on this type of cycling and almost never have touring bicycles of any kind on hand at their stories. If you can find a local bike shop with someone working there that actually knows something about bicycle touring, you should consider yourself very lucky!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of the people who go into a local bike shop looking for a touring bicycle come out having been sold a bicycle that isn&#8217;t really designed for bicycle touring at all. The result of this is not only an investment in a product that won&#8217;t suit your needs, but could result in damage to your bicycle, your belongings and your body (because an ill-fitting or improperly designed bicycle could break apart during a bicycle tour (yes, this really happens&#8230; and it occurs more often than you might thing) or cause pain, discomfort and even long-lasting nerve damage to your body when used on a multi-day bicycle tour).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-26765" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2014/10/bicycle-touring-bikes.jpg" alt="best bicycle touring bikes" width="660" height="148" /></p>
<p>So, go ahead and check out the impressive list of touring bicycles below, but before you go out and purchase a bike for yourself, <a title="how to find the best touring bicycle" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/touring-bicycles-buyers-guide/">make sure you understand what type of touring bike you are buying and how you wish to use it</a>. Don&#8217;t make the mistake of buying the first bicycle your local bike shop owner suggests. The bicycle you buy is going to be the biggest and most important investment you make&#8230; so make sure you make the right decision!</p>

<h3>Surly Cross Check</h3>
<p>The frame itself is Surly&#8217;s own 4130 cromoly steel, and provides a relatively relaxed and forgiving ride. Like all of Surly‘s bikes, the parts package was chosen for its value, durability and purpose. Surly sells it as a 2&#215;9 speed, but you could add a third ring if you wanted. Or you could make it a single speed. Or a fixie. People use it for commuting, light touring, single-track riding, hauling kids, just about anything you can do on a bike.</p>

Surly added braze-ons for everything you‘re likely to need. They gave it parts that are durable and long lasting, and ready to travel. Add racks, bags, and fenders&#8230; and go somewhere!</p>

<p>While the bicycles listed on this page are indeed designed for the various modes of bicycle travel, I chose (simply as a matter of aesthetics) not to include any folding bicycles, recumbents, tricycles or cargo bikes in this list of touring bicycles.</p>
<p>This is only 100 of the more than 150+ different types of touring bicycles you can choose from. Inside <strong><a title="The Touring Bicycle Book by Bicycle Touring Pro" href="http://touringbicyclebook.com"><em>The Essential Guide To Touring Bicycles</em></a></strong> there are even more touring bikes listed for you, along with detailed information about what makes a touring bicycle different from other bicycles you are probably familiar with (such as road and mountain bikes).</p>
The Touring Bicycle Buyer&#8217;s Guide Find The Best Touring Bicycle For You!
<p><em>The Essential Guide To Touring Bicycles</em> discusses the important features that makes touring bicycles ideal for long, multi-day cycling adventures and how the manufacturers of these bikes tweak their designs ever-so slightly in order to make the bicycle more rugged and able to carry more weight/gear, while at the same time making the bicycle more comfortable on your body (especially on your back, neck, arms and hands).</p>
<p><strong>If you have experience with any of these bicycles, I would love to hear what you have to say. Leave a comment below and let me know what bike you have, how you&#8217;ve used it and what you like best/worst about that bicycle.</strong></p>
