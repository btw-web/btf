<p>There are thousands of people all around the world conducting <a title="Guided Bicycle Tours" href="http://www.gobicycletouring.com" target="_blank">guided</a> and self-supported bicycle tours&#8230; and you can be one of them!</p>
<p>Below is a brief interview with <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> reader, Shane, after he recently completed a bike tour with his son and nephew in Michigan state&#8217;s upper peninsula.</p>
<p><strong>Shane, did you have any fears when you started planning or preparing for your bike tour? If so, what were they?</strong></p>
<p>I had two major fears. My biggest fear was that my 13 yr old son and my 12 yr old nephew who were traveling with me would get tired or bored along the way. My other major fear was finding places to stay at night.</p>
<p>In the end, the boys had a great time along the way. It was their interest in seeing what was over the next hill that kept them going. As for the camping situation, I knew that in Michigan&#8217;s upper peninsula its mostly state and federal land, so I knew we could always just <a title="what is wild camping" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/50-best-stealth-camping-tips/">wild camp</a> along the way&#8230; and that&#8217;s exactly what we did.</p>
<p><strong>What were your favorite parts of the bicycle touring experience?</strong></p>
<p>The time with the boys, the people we met and the experiences we enjoyed along the way.</p>
<p><strong>What was the thing you liked least about your bicycle tour&#8230; and how did you think that aspect of your travels could be improved upon in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Probably the fact we probably brought to much gear. This year we have another trip planned and we&#8217;ll be talking much less stuff.</p>
<p><strong>What one piece of information inside &#8220;<a title="The bicycle touring book" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/the-bicycle-travelers-blueprint/">The Bicycle Traveler&#8217;s Blueprint</a>&#8221; helped you most in preparing for your tour?</strong></p>
<p>I learned not worry so much about the small stuff. It will all work its self out along the way.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned that you are already planning another bicycle tour for the future. Where are you thinking of going and why do you want to go there?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are going to ride this year from Pittsburgh to DC on the gap and C and O rail trail. Not having to deal with traffic will be great and just peddling along through the mountains and camping along the way will be great fun.</p>
<p><strong>What one piece of advice would you give to someone who is planning their first bicycle touring adventure?</strong></p>
<p>Do it! Don&#8217;t let anything stand in your way. It seems a little scary <a title="how to plan for a bike tour" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/the-bicycle-travelers-blueprint/">planning and figuring it all out</a>, but once you do it once you will be hooked and want to do it again.</p>
