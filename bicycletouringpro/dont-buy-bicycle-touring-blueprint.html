<p>Here&#8217;s what I think&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t buy <em>The Bicycle Touring Blueprint</em> if you can afford to waste days, weeks and months of your life trying to find similar information for free on the Internet &#8211; most it from inexperienced bicycle travelers who don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about, have only spent a very short amount of time on the road, or only have experience with bike touring in a very small part of the world.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t buy <em>The Bicycle Touring Blueprint</em> if you have money to kill and don&#8217;t mind wasting your hard-earned cash buying the wrong bicycle, gear and clothing for your first bike tour.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t buy <em>The Bicycle Touring Blueprint</em> if you want to make all the mistakes so many first-time bicycle tourists make on their initial bike tours &#8211; mistakes that ultimately compromise their travels and force them to quit and go home early.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t buy <em>The Bicycle Touring Blueprint</em> if you think you already know everything there is to know about bicycle touring&#8230; or if you just want to make it up as you go along, and you&#8217;re okay with suffering unnecessarily.</li>
<li>Finally, don&#8217;t buy <em>The Bicycle Touring Blueprint</em> is you aren&#8217;t serious about making your bike touring dreams come true &#8211; because it&#8217;s the people who put in the work, do the research, and receive the best education that go on to achieve personal bike touring success.</li>
