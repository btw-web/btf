<h1>Breaking Tradition. A Different Type Of &#8220;Bicycle Touring&#8221;</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="wp-image-940 alignnone" title="lucern-alt1" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2009/01/lucern-alt1.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="447" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As I write this, I’m sitting in front of my laptop computer in Luzern (Lucerne), Switzerland. I’ve rented an apartment here for the next two months and this flat, located above a bakery in Luzern’s main shopping district, will serve as my home base for the first part of my ninth and longest “bicycle tour”.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From where I sit, I have a view down to the street where people walk past all day long – getting groceries at the supermarket across the way, running to work in the neighboring office buildings, stepping into one of the many nearby churches, or picking up a newspaper at the corner “kiosk”. Everyone is well dressed and put together. While black seems to be the predominant color, no one looks the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My apartment is better than expected. The location couldn’t be more perfect. Luzern’s famous Chapel Bridge and Lion Monument are just a few steps out my door and Lake Luzern is even closer! I have TV, Internet access, a kitchen, bedroom, bath, access to a washing machine and a huge outdoor balcony.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Outside, there are bicycles everywhere. It’s freezing (literally freezing (17<strong>°</strong> F)) and there’s snow on the ground. But despite the weather, people are out and about. This, as it seems, is life in Luzern!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>But wait! I bet you’re thinking to yourself, “This doesn’t sound like a ‘bicycle tour’.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If that’s what you are thinking, you’re right! This is not a “traditional” bicycle tour.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Traditional bicycle touring as most people know it is the act of riding your bike during the day and spending almost every night in a completely difference location. On a traditional bicycle tour, you might spend 30 days on your bike and cover 1,000 or more miles during that time. On a traditional bicycle tour, you might spend most nights in a tent without many of the luxuries you get at home. And on a traditional bicycle tour, you likely would not be in any one place for two months at a time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>So what in the world am I doing? And does this actually qualify as a “bicycle tour”?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, here’s what’s happening:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Back in the summer of 2008 I got it in my head that I wanted to go on another bicycle tour. I had just come back from <a title="Bicycle photos from Aruba" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/photos/album/72157607620396781/aruba-2008.html">bicycling in Aruba</a> and felt that while I had enjoyed my time in the Caribbean, the trip had been entirely too short. No more than a week after returning from that trip, I decided that I would start planning my next great adventure… and knew that wherever I ended up going, it was going to be a multi-month long journey.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was then that I began planning my trip. I wrote the article series “<a title="Planning a bicycle touring adventure six months in advance" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/how-to-plan-a-bicycle-tour-6-months-in-advance-step-1-%E2%80%93-make-the-decision/">Planning A Bicycle Tour 6 Months In Advance</a>” and soon thereafter rented out my condo in Park City, Utah for six months straight (Park City is a ski town, so renting the condo during the prime tourist months took less than a week).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now without a place to live for six months, I had to find a place to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the past two years I’ve been trying to learn German on my own, so a trip to Europe was the first thing that came to mind. “But Europe is expensive!” I thought. And it would be winter in Europe, so I wasn’t sure how I would be able to deal with that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition, I had to keep working while I was away. My main source of income comes from a company called <a title="Silver Mountain Marketing" href="http://www.silvermountainmarketing.com"><em>Silver Mountain Marketing</em></a>, which I started after graduating from college in 2004. I knew that if I were away from home for six months straight, there was no way my business would survive unless I continued to put in the work. Nor would I have the money to actually complete the trip if the work came to a halt. So I had to keep working!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>After taking these things into consideration, I decided that: </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><strong>1)</strong> I could afford traveling in Europe if I kept working while I was there and my income did not go down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><strong>2) </strong>I could go to Europe if I could manage riding my bike in freezing cold and snow.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><strong>3)</strong> If I found places to stay that cost me the same or less than what I currently pay for the mortgage on my Park City condominium, traveling through Europe would cost little more than what I pay to live back home in the United States.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So Europe it was!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I’ll go into how I found this apartment and the other apartments I will be staying at while on this trip in a future article (and I’ll tell you how much I paid for them), but now I want to get back to the issue at hand – “traditional bicycle touring”.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because I am staying in an apartment for an extended period of time, this is not a traditional bicycle tour. This is what I call “Bicycle Travel”.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>“Bicycle travel” is you… or me… or anyone for that matter, traveling with a bicycle. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In my case, I will use this apartment (and the other apartments I will rent on this trip) to serve as a home base for my travels. One third of my day will be spent traveling (some days with the bike and some days without). One third of my day will be spent working. And the remaining third of my days in Europe will be spent sleeping.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>In many ways, it’s more than just “bicycle travel”. It’s a “BICYCLE LIFESTYLE”.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Back in November (‘08) I hosted a “bicycle lifestyle web event” here on <em>BicycleTouringPro.com</em> where I tried to get this message across (View the recaps <a title="bicycle lifestyle event day one" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/bicycle-lifestyle-web-event-recap-day-1/">here</a> and <a title="bicycle lifestyle event day two" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/bicycle-lifestyle-web-event-recap-day-2/">here</a>). During this event, I tried to show that bicycling doesn’t have to be something you just do on the weekends. It doesn’t have to be something you save up for and then do just once in your life. And it doesn’t have to be an activity that requires special clothes or any specific skills (other than actually knowing how to ride a bike).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What I am doing here in Europe is more than just “bicycle touring”. What I’m doing here is incorporating the bicycle into the way I live my life. Or maybe, it’s the other way around? Maybe what I’m doing here is merging the way I live my life with my traditional bicycle tours of the past?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Whatever the case may be, this is not traditional bicycle touring. And that’s okay! </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is a notion amongst many bicycle tourists that the act of “bicycle touring” has to be done a certain way. These people feel that you have to put in the miles, use the latest gear, and know all the technical terms. These are the people who log their daily miles in a journal and ride across the country only for the bragging rights of having done a long distance bicycle tour.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While this sort of touring is fine, I don’t believe it’s for everyone. And more than anything else, I don’t think those who choose to travel in other ways should be criticized or looked down upon because they are making alternative choices (I’ve seen this happen time and time again by the traditional bicycle touring world).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After nine years of traveling by bike, I’ve come to the realization that the miles you cover by bicycle are not important. While covering long distances is impressive, what’s more important are the experiences you have along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I look back on my previous eight bicycle tours, almost all of the truly magical, once-in-a-lifetime moments occurred when I was off my bike.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let me say that again!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>When I look back on my previous eight bicycle tours, almost all of the truly magical, once-in-a-lifetime moments occurred when I was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">off my bike</span>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I’ve discovered, after nine years of cycling, that it’s not really about the bike. It’s not about the miles. It’s not about gear. It’s not about panniers vs. trailers. It’s not about the clothes… or the money… or the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What I’ve discovered is that the bicycle you ride is simply the vehicle that gets you from one experience to the next. Everything else is entirely up to you!</p>
