<p>Are you looking for a high-quality set of bicycle panniers for running errands near your home, cycling to the office, or for use on your bicycle tour around the world?</p>
<p>A <em>pannier</em> is a backpack-sized bag that attaches to your bicycle (via your bicycle’s front or rear rack) and is used to store and transport your personal belongings with you on your bike as your ride.</p>

<p>Panniers are usually sold in sets of two (one for the left side of your bike and one for the right) although those wishing to conduct a self-supported bicycle tour may purchase two sets of panniers for their bicycle (one pair to be used on the bicycle’s rear rack, and the other to be used on the front rack).</p>
<p>The main benefit to using a set of panniers for bicycle touring (or local commuting) is that the weight of your gear (food, clothing, bike tools, etc) is placed onto the frame of your bicycle and not onto your back, neck, shoulders or body (which tends to cause pain, redness, sweating and discomfort). Other major benefits include a low center of gravity (which makes controlling your bicycle easier) and a compact means of transporting your gear (in comparison to a trailer, for instance, which can double the length of your bicycle). In essence, if you have something you want to carry with you on your bicycle as you ride, one or two sets of panniers is a great way to do it!</p>
<p>While there are other methods of carrying your personal belongings on your bike (such as with a trailer, backpack, or basket), panniers are the most popular means of transporting your things on a bicycle tour – whether that be a short bicycle tour near your home or a long-distance bicycle touring adventure on the other side of the world.</p>
<p>On this page you will find a list of all the companies in the world currently producing bicycle panniers of some kind. The pannier companies shown here have been listed in alphabetical order.</p>

<h3>Brompton</h3>
<p>Because of the small size and odd shape of Brompton folding bicycles, bags designed for use with Brompton bicycles are small and usually meant to be carried on the front and rear ends of the bike. While the Brompton handlebar bags and rear rack packs are the most popular bags available, there are a few smaller panniers made for use with Brompton folding bikes.</p>

<h3>Nashbar</h3>

Plus, the panniers are treated with an EPU coating on the inside which seals the deal -literally.

With liters of capacity, you can hit the road for days or months with these inexpensive bike panniers.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">How Do Panniers Attach To Your Bicycle?</h3>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-2332bcd8-5ed9-d04b-f0c3-36437c71edd5" dir="ltr">Panniers attached to the racks on the front or rear of your bicycle with two small hooks at the top of the panniers and (sometimes, but not always) an attachment of some kind at the bottom of the bag. The hooks at the top of the pannier allows the bag to rest its weight on the rack, while the attachment at the bottom of the pannier keeps the bag from wiggling around while you ride your bike.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Higher quality panniers will not only have a locking mechanism of some kind on the hooks at the tops of the panniers, which helps to ensure that your panniers will not bounce off your bicycle racks when you ride in rough terrain or cycle over a large bump in the road, but they also allow the hooks on the top of the panniers to be moved forward or back, so that they can be adjusted to fit whatever type of rack you might be using on your bicycle. Being able to move your panniers forward or backward is important if you want to have your panniers fit properly on your bicycle. Proper fit ensures that your panniers will not fly off the bike while in motion, but also allow the panniers to be adjusted forward or backward if you find that they are hitting your toes or heels while you ride (a common problem with larger panniers and/or people with big feet).</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the bottom of most bicycle touring panniers there are two common attachments. The attachment found on the bottom of each pannier is either a bungee cord with a small hook on the bottom of it, which attaches to the metal rack by simply hooking onto the bottom portion of the rack&#8230; or it is a plastic or metal slide that slips around the backside of the rack in order to hold the pannier in place while you ride.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Inexpensive bicycle panniers will have no attachment of any kind at the bottom of the bag. Medium grade panniers will usually have a bungee attachment of some kind, but this bungee is usually unmoveable and can quickly wear out or break after just a short period of time. This is why the higher quality panniers have either a thick bungee cord attachment at their base or a thick plastic or metal slide, which can be adjusted into multiple positions for the best possible fit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To attach a pannier with a bungee attachment at its base:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">Engage the bottom wire-hook of the pannier to any part of the rear rack near the wheel axle.</li>
<li>Lift the pannier’s carry handle upward above the top of your rack and hook the pannier on your rack’s outer railing. Then release the pannier’s carrying handle. At this point, some panniers will lock to the rack automatically, while others will need to be locked and secured in place manually.</li>
<li>Then make sure the hooks are well seated and that the bottom attachment is firmly in place.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Attaching a pannier with a plastic slide at its base is very similar:</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">Slide the plastic attachment at the bottom of the pannier behind the rack near the wheel axle.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Lift the pannier’s carry handle upward above the top of your rack and hook the pannier on your rack’s outer railing. Then release the pannier’s carrying handle. At this point, some panniers will lock to the rack automatically, while others will need to be locked and secured in place manually.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Then make sure the plastic attachment at the bottom of the pannier is still in place behind the metal bike rack and that the hooks at the top of the pannier are firmly in place.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Panniers that have a bungee attachment at the bottom are better for riding in off-road conditions, while those panniers with plastic or metal slides are better for on-road riding.</p>
<h3>How Many Bike Panniers Do You Need?</h3>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-2332bcd8-5efe-1f33-ea25-47ff2fbaa14f" dir="ltr">Traditional touring bicycles are built to carry four panniers &#8211; two in the front and two in the rear. But just because a bike is built to carry a full set of panniers doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you have to use that many bags. In many cases, using a full set of panniers is overkill and that’s where deciding between the use of two or four panniers can be difficult.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like many things in the world of bicycle travel, there is no correct answer here. Deciding between the use of two or four panniers will depend on the size of your panniers, the length of your tour, the amount of money you are willing to spend, and any number of other factors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That said, here are some guidelines to help you decide between the use of two or four panniers on your next bicycle tour.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">If you are planning to be on the road for one week or less, you can probably figure out a way to carry everything you need in just two panniers.</li>
<li>If you are going to be traveling for more than a month, you will probably want to opt for four panniers.</li>
<li>If you are going to be carrying a stove, fuel, and all the food and water needed to cook you own meals, then four panniers is likely your best bet.</li>
<li>If you are bringing your computer with you, you might need the extra room provided by a full set of panniers.</li>
<li>If you want to carry your tent, sleeping bag and/or sleeping mat inside one of your panniers (something I recommend), then having four panniers is ideal.</li>
<li>And if you want to ensure that the weight of your gear is distributed equally across your bike (something that is very important), then four panniers is the way to go!</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">But if you can fit everything you need into just two panniers, then by all means, use two panniers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are planning your tour well in advance, I recommend purchasing two rear panniers and then attempting to pack everything you will need for your journey on your bike. If everything fits (and isn’t overflowing onto the top of your rear rack), then you don‘t need to worry about purchasing a set of front panniers. But if you can‘t make everything fit on the back of your bike with just those two rear panniers, then you will need to go out and purchase a set of front panniers (and a front rack).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The key here is to do this with plenty of time before you leave on your journey. Due to the fact that bicycle touring is still a relatively small and unknown activity, getting your hands on a specific set of panniers at the last minute can prove to be difficult in many parts of the world.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Pannier Types: Roll-Top vs. Bucket</h3>
<p dir="ltr">There are two major styles of panniers &#8211; each with its benefits and drawbacks.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Roll-Top Panniers</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Many waterproof panniers come in a style known as “roll-top,” which allows the panniers to be rolled together and secured in place at the top of the bag. This design feature makes the pannier 100% waterproof. As long as the pannier doesn’t have any defects, you can drop a bag of this type in a river and the items inside would not get wet. This is a major advantage when traveling through parts of the world where rain and snow are common, or where there is a chance your bicycle might fall into a lake, river, pond or ocean.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The disadvantage to this style pannier, however, is that they require more material to make, because the fabric has to roll over itself several times at the top of the bag in order to become waterproof, so these types of panniers are usually heavier than their bucket-style counterparts. Roll-top panniers are also a little harder to get in and out of because the top of the pannier has to be unlocked, unrolled, rolled back up and then locked once again each and every time you need to get into the pannier.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Bucket Style Panniers</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Bucket style panniers, on the other hand, can be waterproof or water-resistant, but they are not 100% waterproof in the way that roll-top panniers are. If a bucket style pannier were dropped in a body of water, everything inside the panniers would eventually be wet, as water would quickly seep in through the opening at the top. However, waterproof panniers of this type are technically waterproof when you consider that most panniers are not dropped into solid bodies of water, but are instead dropped on from above by rain and snow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The advantage to bucket style panniers is that they are relatively easy to get in and out of. You just unzip or unbuckle the top flat of the pannier, roll back the fabric, and then reach inside to get whatever it is that you need. When you conduct a long-distance bicycle tour you will find yourself getting in and out of your panniers dozens of times each day, so the bucket style pannier allows this to be done with minimal effort.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">What Size Panniers Do You Need?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Bicycle panniers come in a number of different shapes and sizes. Larger panniers are typically carried on the rear rack of your bicycle, while smaller panniers are carried on the front.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sizes for panniers are usually listed in both liters and cubic inches.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rear touring panniers typically come in sizes ranging from 40 liters (2441 cubic inches) to 60 liters (3660 cubic inches), although sizes in the range of 40-45 liters are more common and are recommended in most instances. 60 liter panniers are massive and are meant only for the longest and biggest of bicycle touring adventures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Front panniers, on the otherhand, are much smaller and are usually between 25 and 30 liters (1526 and 1830 cubic inches).</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you opt to ride with only one set of panniers, then you’ll likely want to purchase a larger set of rear panniers (maybe 45 liters?). But if you are going to be touring fully-loaded with both a set of front and rear panniers, then you may opt for slightly smaller rear panniers (40 liters) in addition to the panniers you would be carrying up front (25 or 30 liters).</p>
<p dir="ltr">But again, the size of the panniers you purchase depends on what your goals are for your trip. If you are going to be carrying a bunch of camera gear, sports equipment or personal items, you might choose to purchase much larger 60+ liter panniers, and there is nothing wrong with doing that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For most people, however, sticking between 40 and 45 liters for rear panniers and 25-30 liters for front panniers will be ideal.</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;ve used any of the panniers listed above, what do you think of them? How could they be improved?</strong></p>
<p>Also, if you know of a company making panniers that should be added to this list, leave a comment below with the name of the company and a link to their website&#8230; and I&#8217;ll be sure to add them to the list.</p>
