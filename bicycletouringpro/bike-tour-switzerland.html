<h1>Join Me On A Bicycle Tour Across Switzerland</h1>

<p>I&#8217;ve made a lot of great friends through my travels, my bike tours and my website here at <em>BicycleTouringPro.com</em>&#8230; but now it&#8217;s time that you and I meet up.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do a bike ride together&#8230; in Switzerland!!!</p>
<h3>Join Me For A Bicycle Tour In Switzerland</h3>
<p>In July of 2012, I am going to be cycling across the country of Switzerland (from Geneva to Rorschach) with European tour company, <em><a title="Bike Switzerland" href="http://www.bikeswitzerland.com" target="_blank">Bike Switzerland</a></em>&#8230; and I’d like for you to join me!</p>
<p>This is an 11-day bicycle tour, during which we will be cycling approximately 560 kilometers (350 miles) through some of Switzerland’s most beautiful mountain, lake and flatland regions.  Along the way, we will be staying in high-class accommodations, partaking in some of the best food and drink that Switzerland has to offer, and seeing some of the most beautiful sights in all of Europe.</p>
<p>If you think this sounds like fun, then I would like to take this moment and personally invite you to join me on <em><a title="Bike Switzerland Challenge Tour" href="http://www.bikeswitzerland.com" target="_blank">Bike Switzerland’s 2012 Challenge Tour</a></em>.</p>
<h3>Why Switzerland?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-13799" title="Bike-Switzerland-Path" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2011/12/Bike-Switzerland-Path.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="412" /></p>
<p>As you may or may not know, I traveled to Switzerland in early 2009 and spent two whole months traveling around the country with my bicycle.</p>
<p>I fell in love with Switzerland right away. Not only is the scenery fantastic, the people incredibly nice, and the food and drinks superb, but Switzerland is home to some of the best cycling I have ever experienced.</p>
<p>When I left Switzerland in 2009, I promised myself that I would come back and see more of the country just as soon as I possibly could&#8230; and now I&#8217;m sticking to that promise by returning for an epic bike ride across the country.</p>
<h3>Cycling In Switzerland: A Bicycle Tour And A Movie</h3>
<p>That said, I&#8217;m not just returning to Switzerland in order to ride my bike across the country. I&#8217;m also traveling to Switzerland in order to document this particular cross-country bike ride for <a title="Cycling Around The World" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/worldtour/">my upcoming feature-length film</a> about cycling around the world.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right! In 2012, I am going to be traveling to more than 15 different locations all around the globe and shooting footage for a feature-length film about how people from all walks of life use bicycles for entertainment, exercise, travel, competition, work and more.</p>
<p>During this cross-country bicycle tour in Switzerland, I am going to be shooting a ton of video footage that will ultimately play a major role in my round-the-world cycling film.</p>
<p>The footage that I shoot while on the <em>Bike Switzerland</em> bike tour will be used to show viewers what &#8220;Guided Bicycle Touring&#8221; is all about. And if you decide to join me in Switzerland and participate in the <em>Challenge Tour</em>, you will get to play a part in the film!</p>
<h3>The Benefits Of Bicycle Touring With Me In Switzerland</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-13800" title="Lucerne-Switzerland" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2011/12/Lucerne-Switzerland.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="412" /></p>
<p>When you sign up for the <em>Bike Switzerland Challenge Tour</em> you will not only get to see Switzerland (one of my favorite countries in all of Europe) and ride bikes with me (Darren Alff &#8211; the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em>), but you will also be featured in my upcoming documentary about cycling around the world.</p>
<p>Plus, <em>Bike Switzerland</em> is making it super easy for you to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime adventure. If you want, you can bring your own bicycle to ride for the tour. Or (better yet) you can leave your bike at home and use one of the 2012 BMC bikes that <em>Bike Switzerland</em> will be providing for each of its tour participants.</p>
<h3>How To Join Me On The Bike Switzerland Challenge Tour</h3>
<p>The <em>Bike Switzerland Challenge Tour</em> starts on July 10, 2012 in Geneva, Switzerland and finishes 11 days later on the 20th of July.</p>
<p>As I said before, I will personally be partaking in this awesome bicycle touring experience&#8230; and if you are interested in joining me, I’d love to meet you there!</p>
<p>To get all the details on the tour, see the route we will be taking across Switzerland, and sign up for the <em>Challenge Tour</em>, please visit the official <em>Bike Switzerland</em> website at <a title="Bike Switzerland" href="http://www.bikeswitzerland.com" target="_blank">www.bikeswitzerland.com. </a></p>
<p>I am so excited to be cycling across Switzerland next July&#8230; and I look forward to riding with you!</p>
