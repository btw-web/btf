<p><a title="Touring bicycle book" href="http://www.touringbicyclebook.com">Click this link to learn more about it and get your copy now.</a></p>
<p>With the launch of this new book, I thought today would be a good day to talk about touring bicycles&#8230; because when it comes to bicycle touring, the bicycle you ride is pretty much your most important piece of equipment.</p>
<p>Pick the right bicycle for your travels and your bike tour could become a dream come true! 🙂</p>
<p>But pick the wrong bicycle and your trip could be over before it&#8217;s even started 🙁</p>
<p>I get emails all the time from people who are looking to purchase their first touring bicycle&#8230; and the emails usually look a little something like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi Darren. I&#8217;m planning to go on my first bicycle tour. Which bicycle should I get?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I then have to write that person back and say, &#8220;Well, it depends. Where are you going on your bicycle tour? How many days, weeks or months will you be traveling? Are you going to camp along the way or will you be staying in hotels and hostels? How much gear do you plan to carry? What is your budget? And will you be using your touring bicycle for any other purposes (such as running errands near your home or riding in races with your local bike club)?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What many first-time bicycle tourists don&#8217;t realize is that there are several different types of bicycles made for bicycle touring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are touring bicycles made for short day trips around your home; fast, sporty touring bicycles made for racing and light touring; and touring bicycles that are made to carry you and your gear all the way around the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The type of bike you select is going to depend on a number of different factors. There isn&#8217;t really JUST ONE touring bicycle that is best for everything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, I get these emails about touring bicycles all the time and I know there are a ton of people out there who are struggling when it comes to selecting the right touring bicycle for their specific needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because I get these emails on a daily and weekly basis, I know how difficult it can be to find the ideal touring bicycle. And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve gone ahead and created a resource for those of you who are in the process of looking to purchase a new touring bike.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;<a title="The Essential Guide To Touring Bicycles" href="http://www.touringbicyclebook.com">The Essential Guide To Touring Bicycles</a>&#8221; is a new eBook I created that takes you by the hand and teaches you about what to look for in your perfect touring bicycle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The book not only educates you about touring bicycles, the different types of bikes, and their intended uses, but the book also features detailed information on more than 200 different types of touring bicycles made by large and small bike companies all over the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You&#8217;ve probably spent some time looking at touring bicycles online, but I can guarantee you have never seen this many touring bicycles in one single place!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s true! There are more than 200 touring bicycles inside this new book. 205 to be exact!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And from this list of 200+ bicycles, I will help you narrow down the selection and find the touring bicycle that best suits your needs.</p>
