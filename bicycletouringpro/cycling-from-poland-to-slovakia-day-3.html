<p>Day 3 of my bike ride from Krakow, Poland to Cadca, Slovakia was easily one of the most difficult days of bicycle touring I have ever experienced. The distance was a <a title="route I took" href="http://goo.gl/maps/Hr25v" target="_blank">short 52 kilometers</a>, but the roads were uphill most of the way and were usually covered in an inch or more of ice and snow. Only a few rare streets had been cleared of the thick winter slush and this made the riding slow, slippery and difficult.</p>
<p>While there were hundreds of beautiful photo opportunities along the way, I didn&#8217;t stop to take many pictures. I knew after the first few hours of riding that reaching Cadca was either going to be impossible or extremely difficult. So rather than wasting time with photos, I just put my head down and kept moving forward. I didn&#8217;t take a break all day long. I just kept going and going and going. It was exhausting work and I knew that I was nearing my mental and physical limit as it started to get dark, snow began to fall and vehicle traffic increased. If I had had to go for another hour or more, I don&#8217;t think I would have made it. But I reached my hotel in Cadca just minutes before I reached my end.</p>
<p>After checking into the hotel, I opened up my window to look outside. The sky was white with falling snow while at the same time being black from the lack of sun. I had arrived just in time. I had made it! And now it was time to go to sleep. Cadca, Slovakia would be my home for the next few days.</p>
