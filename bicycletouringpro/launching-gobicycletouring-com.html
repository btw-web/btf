<p>It&#8217;s January 1, 2013. How are you spending your first day of the year?</p>
<p>Me? I&#8217;m in Krakow, Poland&#8230; and for the last six months I have been working towards this day. Today I am launching my new website at <a title="GoBicycleTouring website" href="http://www.gobicycletouring.com" target="_blank">www.gobicycletouring.com</a>.</p>
<p><em>GoBicycleTouring</em> is the new sister-site to <em>BicycleTouringPro.com</em>.</p>
<p>While <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> is largely about self-supported bicycle touring and long-distance bicycle travel, <em>GoBicycleTouring</em> is a place where people can quickly and easily find guided and self-guided bicycle tours from all around the world to participate in.</p>
<p>After conducting several guided bike tours myself over the last couple years, and after receiving hundreds of emails from people asking me if I knew of any good guided or self-guided bicycle tours that they could participate in, I knew that creating a website like <a title="GoBicycleTouring.com" href="http://www.gobicycletouring.com" target="_blank"><em>GoBicycleTouring.com</em></a> would be a good idea.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get everything finished with the website that I wanted to, but the website is up and running and I will have those additional changes finished sometime soon.</p>
<p>Today, however, my plan is to simply stay in <a title="my apartment in Krakow, Poland" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/video-tour-of-my-apartment-in-krakow-poland/">my apartment here in Krakow, Poland</a> and work on the launch of this new website. Getting this website to work for both my readers and the bike tour companies that have listed their tours on the website is going to be a lot of work for me this year, but I know that with time I can make this into something extremely successful.</p>
<p>Another thing worth mentioning is that one of my goals this year is to take a photo of myself every single day. When I completed <a title="Bicycle touring in Europe - random thoughts and ideas" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/random-thoughts-on-my-european-bike-tour/">my 9-month bicycle tour across Europe</a> in 2009, I came home and realized I had hardly any photos of myself. That&#8217;s why when I went to Peru in 2010/2011, I bought a new camera and committed myself to taking better photos. <a title="Peru Photo ebook" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/peru-book/">I think I did a pretty good job!</a></p>
<p>Then, this past year, as I traveled across Europe once again, I took a whole lot of photos as well. But like in 2009, I realized that I did not take nearly as many photos of myself as I would have liked.</p>
<p>So this year my goal is to take at least one decent photo of myself every single day. Most days the photos will be okay, but every once and a while I might just take a winner. I won&#8217;t share every photo with you here on the website, but I will (at the very least) have more than 300+ photos of myself by the end of the year&#8230; and that will far surpass the number of photos I have ever taken of myself on my travels around the world.</p>
