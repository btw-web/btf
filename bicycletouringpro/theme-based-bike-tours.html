<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-12476" title="Baseball Stadium Bicycle Tour" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2011/09/Baseball-Stadium-Bicycle-Tour-588x390.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="438" /></p>
<p>Have you ever thought about making your bicycle tour more than just a trip by bike by turning your two-wheeled adventure into a theme-based experience?</p>
<p>Theme-based bicycle tours are a fun and interesting way to both travel the world and get others excited about your own adventures.</p>
<p><em>For example:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2005 I cycled down the Pacific Coast of the United States and stopped to skate at nearly every single skateboard park along the way.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In 2011, 24-year-old <a title="baseball bicycle tour" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Baseball-Biking-Tour/112785048771614" target="_blank">Darren O&#8217;Donnell</a> rode his bicycle around the USA and visited every professional baseball stadium.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And now, Diana June (aka <a title="Indiana June choose your own adventure bicycle tour" href="http://www.indianajune.com/" target="_blank">Indiana June</a>) is conducting a long-distance bicycle tour where her online readers get to vote and decide where she heads next through an &#8220;Indian Jones&#8221; type poll on her website.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just three examples of theme-based bicycle tours where a trip by bike has been combined with another fun and interesting activity, experience, or destination.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t have to be a skateboarder, baseball fan, or Internet junkie in order to conduct a theme-based bike tour. There are tons of other things out there to mix with your bicycle travels.</p>
<p><em>For example:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You might cycle to all the amusement parks in the world.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ride your bike to and fish in every one of your country&#8217;s largest lakes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Use your bike tour as a chance to study astronomy, learn to identify constellations, and teach others about the cosmos.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cycle to the place where your grandparents were born and raised and research the history of your own family while you are there.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Travel by bike to every <em>Apple</em> store in China.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ride your bike along the length of the Thailand and <a title="eat sleep surf bicycle tour" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/eat-sleep-surf-bicycle-surfing-indoensia-documentary/">go surfing</a> at all the great surf spots along the way.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And any number of additional such ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a ton of different ways to combine your bicycle touring adventures with other fun, exciting, and educational experiences. But now it&#8217;s your turn to decide how you are going to turn your bicycle tour into more than just a trip by bike.</p>
