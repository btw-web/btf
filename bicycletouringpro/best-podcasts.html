<p>When you go on a bike tour there tends to be a lot of time to fill where you are by yourself with nothing to do. At the end of the day, after several hours of cycling, there&#8217;s nothing better than laying down in bed and listening to a good podcast!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned in several of my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLotHMGSiRt6pES77gE3h44hZIe4bx_iVz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> video blogs</a> that I enjoy listening to podcasts &#8211; both while I&#8217;m riding my bicycle during the day and at night when I settle down inside my tent. So, today I thought I&#8217;d take a moment to share some of the podcasts I enjoy listening to the most.</p>
