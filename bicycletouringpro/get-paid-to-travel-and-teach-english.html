<h1>Get Paid To Travel And Teach English</h1>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7728 alignleft" title="teach english" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/08/teachenglish-588x379.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="425" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Did you know that people from all walks of life and countries all over the world take part in English language teaching programs and actually get paid to live in a foreign country, teach English to the locals, and experience a foreign land? It&#8217;s true!  <a title="Teaching English overseas" href="http://www.1shoppingcart.com/app/?Clk=3932964" target="_blank">Teaching English overseas</a> is not only a great learning experience for the people you teach English to, but it&#8217;s a great experience for you as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of my good college roommates went to Japan after graduating from college and spent a year there teaching English at a small school in the countryside. He had just a handful of students that he worked with, so he only worked about three or four hours every day. When his work was over, he&#8217;d ride his bicycle to a nearby beach and make friends with the locals. Then, at night, he&#8217;d return to his private three-bedroom home  &#8211; a home that was totally paid for by the school he was working at. And at the end of the month he took home thousands of dollars &#8211; money he was able to save up and use to go on a bunch of other world travels once his teaching job in Japan was finished.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Do you know what the best part is?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The best part is that my old college roommate is not a professional teacher, does not have a teaching degree, and didn&#8217;t speak a word of Japanese when he got the teaching job in Japan.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To me, that&#8217;s pretty darn incredible&#8230; and living a relaxed life like that for a whole year in a country like Japan seems like once incredible experience few people will ever get to have.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The problem with <a title="English teaching how to" href="http://www.1shoppingcart.com/app/?Clk=3932964" target="_blank">teaching English overseas</a>, however, is that learning how to get these sorts of jobs can be difficult. You could probably spend a couple weeks searching around on the Internet and find the information you need, but who wants to spend two whole weeks doing that? Not me, that&#8217;s for sure!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That&#8217;s why I want to tell you about Nomadic Matt and his <em>How To Teach English Overseas </em>eBook.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nomadic Matt is a guy I&#8217;ve spoken about before on <em>BicycleTouringPro.com</em>. For the past few years Matt has been traveling around the world and making a full-time living from his website and his various part-time jobs (such as teaching English in foreign countries).If you haven&#8217;t already checked out his website, I encourage you to do so now: <a title="Nomadic Matt" href="http://www.1shoppingcart.com/app/?af=1240113" target="_blank">www.nomadicmatt.com</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But what&#8217;s so great about Nomadic Matt is that because he has so much experience teaching English in foreign countries, he&#8217;s compiled all of the hard-to-find information about the subject into a short, easy to read guide that will take you by the hand and teach you everything you need to know about how to get a job as an English teacher in a foreign country like Argentina, Belgium, China, Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Ukraine, Dubai, Japan, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, or Guatemala.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If teaching English and getting paid to live in a foreign country sounds like something you might be interested in, head on over to Matt&#8217;s website right away and pick up a copy of his book, <em><a title="How To Teach English Overseas" href="http://www.1shoppingcart.com/app/?Clk=3932964" target="_blank">How To Teach English Overseas</a>. </em></p>
