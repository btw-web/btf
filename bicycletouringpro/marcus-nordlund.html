<p>Marcus Nordlund is a resident of Sundbyberg, Sweden who recently completed a bicycle tour from Skopje, Macedonia to Thessaloniki, Greece. Here&#8217;s what he had to say about his adventure:</p>
<p><strong>Why did you become interested in bicycle touring? And where exactly did you go during your bicycle tour?</strong></p>
<p>I decided I wanted to get out of my comfort zone, so during the fall of 2012 I decided to try bicycle touring, much thanks to <a title="Kate Harris bicycle traveler" href="http://kateharris.ca/" target="_blank">Kate Harris</a> and <a title="Darren Alff" href="http://www.darrenalff.com" target="_blank">Darren Alff</a> for being big fountains of inspiration.</p>
<p>The countries in question are Macedonia, Albania and Greece, from Skopje in Macedonia to Thessaloniki in Greece.</p>
<p><strong>What was your biggest fear when planning or preparing for your trip by bike? And how exactly did you overcome that fear?</strong></p>
<p>I was really scared that I was gonna get robbed or have things stolen from me. I&#8217;ve had issues about expensive stuff that I&#8217;ve owned for as long as I can remember, my head tells me I need to wear silk gloves when repairing the bike for example. So I was very worried about loosing stuff and actually never thought much about the things that turned out to be real issues, dangers while bicycling and my fitness condition.</p>
<p>I overcame my fears mostly because of fatigue, when I reached whatever destination I was going for I was forced to trust people. I had to trust that the bike would be safe, I had to leave the bicycle out of sight for minutes here and there and in the end of the trip I really think I had made major progress in regards to these issues even if I weren&#8217;t &#8220;cured&#8221; yet.</p>
<p><strong>What was the thing you liked most about your bicycle touring experience?</strong></p>
<p>What I loved about my trip was that it reinforced my belief in people, that they are kind at heart. I also was spoiled silly by all the panoramic views and beauty that surrounded me in countless parts of the trip. Lastly, I enjoyed being in the moment. I had ideas at the beginning of my tour that I would sort out my life and contemplate on issues from my everyday life, but I didn&#8217;t. It turned out I was very &#8220;right now&#8221; in my mindset while out there and rarely ventured off into thoughts about the past or the future when I was out there.</p>
<p><strong>What was the thing you liked LEAST about your bicycle touring experience&#8230; and how did you think that aspect of your travels could be improved upon in the future?</strong></p>
<p>I really disliked the dogs. No, I hated the dogs! I am a dog person but I&#8217;m thinking of changing religion to cat worshiper!</p>
<p>On a serious note, the amount of loose dogs on the trip really took away quite a big chunk of the bicycling experience when they come running like possessed whilst barking. At times I just wanted to scream out loud in fury. I found out that if you actually slow down, almost to a halt, they are less likely to actually do anything besides barking. I don&#8217;t wanna start looking for stones or sticks nor having like spray with me if I can leave it. However, I guess it depends on the situation.</p>
<p>I also had more problems with hills than expected. I had to walk with the bike for quite extended amounts of time during the steeper climbs mostly because I was so unfit. But another big reason I had to walk my bike was due to how much the bicycle weighed and the road conditions &#8211; especially in Macedonia and Albania.</p>
<p><strong>What one piece of information from the website at www.bicycletouringpro.com helped you the most in planning, preparing for, or executing your bicycle tour?</strong></p>
<p>I had big help from the parts about <a title="Stretching for cyclists" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/stretching-for-cyclists/">stretching</a> and thinking about your riding position when it comes to your seat and handlebars.</p>
<p><strong>Name three things you learned from your bicycle tour:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I learned that I am more capable to manage situations of all kinds than I expected.</li>
<li>I learned that Albania is a poor, weird, beautiful and friendly country.</li>
<li>I learned that a positive view on things and people is important.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do you think you&#8217;ll conduct more bicycle tours in the future? If so, where do you want to go? And why do you want to go there?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I would love to continue from Thessaloniki down through Turkey along the coast and western Europe as well as USA are also goals I would like to try out at some point.</p>
<p><strong>What one piece of advice would you give to someone who is planning their first bicycle touring adventure?</strong></p>
<p>Think about how you wanna travel and remember that you have to get all your gear up and down stairs, hills and whatnot, so packing less is always a good choice.</p>
