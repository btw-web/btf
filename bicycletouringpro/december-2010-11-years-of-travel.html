<h1>December 2010: Traveling For 11 Years Straight</h1>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9048" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;" title="Atlanta Airport" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/11/waiting-for-the-plane-at-th.jpg" alt="Waiting for the plane at the airport" width="267" height="194" />I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been 11 years since I went off on my first long-distance travel adventure. I was 17-years-old at the time; had never spent a single day away from my friends, family and home; and I had no cycling or travel experience whatsoever. But things sure have changed over the years. Since my first bike trip in the year 2001, I&#8217;ve cycled across North America 6 different times, traveled to dozens of countries around the world, and learned a whole lot about myself, other people and the world in which we live.</p>
<p>2011 will be my 11th consecutive year of long-distance travel&#8230; and unlike my previous adventures, I&#8217;m going to South America this time around.</p>
<p>In fact, I&#8217;m on the airplane right now. I&#8217;m not flying to South America straight away, however. I&#8217;m flying to California to visit my friends and family for a couple days, and after that I&#8217;ll make my way south towards Lima, Peru for the start of my adventure. I&#8217;m super excited about this trip&#8230; and I&#8217;m even more excited to share my travels with you.</p>
<p>Over the next several months you are going to see the content here at <em>BicycleTouringPro.com </em>change ever so slightly. I will continue to post product reviews, how-to articles and photo essays, but I also plan to post a number of updates from my travels in South America as well. These updates will be posted as they happen and will include: video featurettes, photo essays, stories from the road, interviews with people I meet on my travels, and a whole lot more!</p>
<p>The next time you hear from me I&#8217;ll be in Peru. In the meantime, tide yourself over by catching up on some of the latest articles and more from <em>BicycleTouringPro.com</em>:</p>

<h3>My Apartment In Tivat, Montenegro</h3>
<p>Last year I spent 9 months traveling with my bicycle through 16 European countries. One of those countries was the tiny coastal national of Montenegro. While the country eventually grew on me, Monentegro was one of the most difficult places for me to adapt to. If you are interested in learning about my travels in Montenegro and how I went about renting an apartment here, <a title="Travels in montenegro" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/my-apartment-in-tivat-montenegro/">be sure to check out this article</a>.</p>
<h3>Get Paid To Travel And Teach English</h3>
<p>I get emails all the time from people who want to travel and experience new places, but they don&#8217;t know how to make the money necessary to fund their travel adventures. As I share in <a title="Travel and teach english" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/get-paid-to-travel-and-teach-english/">this brief article</a>, one of the ways to afford International travel is to teach English in a foreign country. One of my college roommates taught English for two years in Japan, absolutely loved it, and make a lot of money in the process. It&#8217;s something just about anyone can do. <a title="teach english and make money" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/get-paid-to-travel-and-teach-english/">Even you!</a></p>
<h3>16 Photos Of Split, Croatia</h3>
<p>The city of Split is the second largest city in all of Croatia (with Zagreb being the largest). The city lies on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea and serves as both a popular tourist destination and a port to many of the nearby Adriatic islands that surround the area. I traveled to Split in April of 2009 before jumping on a ferry boat and traveling to the island of Korcula. Click here to see <a title="Split croatia travel photos" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/16-photos-of-split-croatia/">some of the photos I took while I was in Split</a>.</p>
<h3>3 Reasons You Should Carry Business Cards On Your Travels</h3>
<p>If you plan to travel for an extended period of time, you might consider making yourself some business cards that you can pass out to the people you meet on your journey. Having a stack of customized business cards will not only make it easier for you to pass your information off to the people you’ve met while on your travels, but having your own business cards may also open you up to opportunities you may have not otherwise received. <a title="travel business card ideas" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/3-reasons-travelers-should-carry-business-cards/">Here are three reasons you should be carrying business cards</a> of some type with you on your travels.</p>
<h3>The Lost Cyclist: Video Book Review</h3>
<p>“The Lost Cyclist” is a true story about a young American cyclist by the name of Frank Lenz who, in the late 1800?s, sets off on a mission to cycle around the world and secure his place in the record books. Unfortunately, Frank never made it home. He successfully navigated his way 3/4 of the way around the globe and then went missing somewhere in the middle of Turkey. “The Lost Cyclist” is a book about Frank Lenz, the world-wide bicycle scene at this point in history, and a detailed account of just how much the world has changed since this incredible point in time over 100 years ago. To hear my thoughts on the book, <a title="The Lost Cyclist video review" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/the-lost-cyclist-video-book-review/">click here to watch my video review</a>.</p>
