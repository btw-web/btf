<p>2014 is going to be an incredible year for bicycle touring.</p>
<p>Do you know how I know that?</p>
<p>I know that 2014 is going to be an incredible year for bicycle touring because every year I get thousands of emails from people all around the world telling me about the incredible cycling adventures they have planned for the days, weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p>With 2014 now officially here, I&#8217;ve already received hundreds of emails from people just like you, writing to say that they have some big bicycle tour planned for later in the year.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right! <strong>There are thousands of people just like you planning to participate in a bicycle tour this year. </strong></p>
<p>But what about you? Have you made plans to go bicycle touring yet?</p>
<p>If not, now is the time to start working toward that goal. <strong>2014 is the year you need to finally go bicycle touring!</strong></p>
<p>There are so many wonderful benefits to traveling the world by bike (whether you ride locally or somewhere on the other side of the planet).</p>
<p>For example, bicycle touring is a great way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do something new</li>
<li>See places you&#8217;ve never seen before</li>
<li>Learn about new places/countries</li>
<li>Try new foods</li>
<li>Meet new people</li>
<li>Make new friends</li>
<li>Spend time alone (spend time thinking)</li>
<li>Challenge your way of thinking</li>
<li>Find out new ways of doing things, seeing the world, approaching life.</li>
<li>Get into nature</li>
<li>Connect on a deeper level with your traveling partner(s) &#8211; share a unique experience</li>
<li>Accomplish something physically and mentally challenging (push yourself beyond your limits)</li>
<li>Get physically fit, lose weight, tone muscles, train for a larger bike ride or race.</li>
<li>Recoup and rethink your life</li>
<li>Plus, a whole lot more!</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to bicycle touring, people always ask me, <strong>&#8220;What is the hardest part about traveling by bike?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The answer might surprise you.</p>
<p>The truth is, the hardest part about bicycle touring and the thing that holds most people back from conducting the bicycle tour of their dreams is simply the fact that they never make the decision to try.</p>
<p><strong>I hope that this year you will finally commit to making that bicycle tour of your dreams come true.</strong> Whether you have never gone bicycle touring before or are an experienced bicycle tourist, I hope that 2014 will be the year that bicycle touring changes your life forever!</p>
<p>But how exactly do you get started?</p>
<p>Well, if you&#8217;ve never been on a bicycle tour before, you might consider conducting a <a href="http://www.gobicycletouring.com" target="_blank">guided or self-guided bicycle tour</a> before trying to travel by bike entirely on your own.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/types-of-bicycle-tours/" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about the 3 main types of bicycle tours</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Guided and self-guided bicycle tours are a great way to experience the joys and benefits of bicycle touring, without all the hassle of having to plan out a safe route, find places to sleep each night, cook your own meals, etc. And guided/self-guided bicycle tours are a great way to meet other people who have similar interests as you.</p>
<p>To find a guided or self-guided bicycle tour to participate in this year, first spend some time thinking about your ideal bicycle touring destination.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to go bicycle touring close to home?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Or do you want to travel to a foreign country and explore the area in one of the best ways possible? &#8211; on a bike!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>After you&#8217;ve decided where your ideal bicycle tour would be located, visit the website at <a href="http://www.gobicycletouring.com/tours/" target="_blank">www.gobicycletouring.com</a> and search for bicycle tours in that part of the world.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be participating in a few guided and self-guided bicycle tours this year myself. I&#8217;ve already got three self-guided bicycle tours planned for 2014 in Austria, Latvia/Estonia and Finland.</p>
<p>In fact, I&#8217;ll be sharing more about these bicycle tours over the next couple weeks and inviting you to join me on these tours if you like. So keep an eye out for my next update, because in that article I&#8217;ll be explaining how you can ride your bike this year with the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> himself (&lt;&#8211; that&#8217;s me!).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-22611" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/12/IMG_2656-588x392.jpg" alt="guided mountain bike tour in africa" width="588" height="392" /></p>
<p>If, however, guided bicycle touring is not your thing, and you&#8217;d prefer to carry all your own gear, cook your own meals, plan your own route and find your own places to sleep each night, then you should start planning your very own self-supported bicycle tour.</p>
<p>Self-supported bicycle touring is one of the more difficult means of traveling by bike, but it is also very popular.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written more than 1,000 free articles about self-supported bicycle touring on my website at <a href="https://www.bicycletouringpro.com" target="_blank">www.bicycletouringpro.com</a> and created one of <a title="Bicycle Touring Guidebook" href="https://www.bicycletouringbook.com">the most popular bicycle touring guidebooks ever written</a> on the subject &#8211; a book that has helped thousands of people from all around the world plan, prepare for, and execute their very own bicycle touring adventures.</p>

<p>Finally, stay tuned to Bicycle Touring Pro over the next 12 months because there is a lot going on&#8230; and you are going to want to pay attention.</p>
<p>As the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em>, I will be conducting 10 solid months of bicycle touring in 2014, and I&#8217;ll be cycling across more than 14 different countries in North America, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be inviting you to go bicycle touring with me on my travels in Austria, Latvia/Estonia and Finland. Stay tuned for more details!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be launching a private 6-week bicycle touring coaching course for people who need a little extra help planning, preparing for and executing their own self-supported bicycle tours.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll be sharing the travels of both myself and hundreds of other bicycle tourists online here at <em>www.</em>BicycleTouringPro.com and on the following social media websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/bicycletouring" target="_blank">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bicycletouringpro" target="_blank">YouTube</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.pinterest.com/darrenalff/bicycle-touring-pro-photos-from-the-road/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, 2014 is going to be a great year for bicycle touring. I&#8217;m super excited about getting back out on the road myself&#8230; and about helping so many others conduct the bicycle tour of their dreams.</p>
<p>I hope that this year you make the commitment to finally go bicycle touring.</p>
<p>Happy New Year. I hope you make it a great one!</p>
