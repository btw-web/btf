<h1>Trading Your Skills For Free Hotel Rooms &#038; Apartments</h1>
<p>This article is about how I obtained 3-weeks of free accommodations while traveling by myself in the country of Peru&#8230; and it&#8217;s about how YOU can do the same thing anywhere in the world by using the simple trick I am about to tell you about.</p>
<p>But before I tell you how to go about <a title="how to get free hotel rooms" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/traveling-cyclists-guide-to-free-hotels-campgrounds/">receiving free hotel rooms</a>, apartments, condos, camping sites and more using this &#8220;not-so-secret&#8221; strategy, let me tell you how I was able to recently use this technique for myself and save hundreds of dollars by securing a totally free apartment in the city of Arequipa, Peru.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9189" title="free arequipa apartment" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2011/01/free-arequipa-apartment-588x417.jpg" alt="the apartment I got for free in arequipa peru" width="659" height="467" /></p>
<h3>This Is How I Did It:</h3>
<p>After a 10 hour bus ride, I pulled into the city of Arequipa, Peru &#8211; the second largest city in the country. Once in Arequipa, I set out to find a place to stay for the next few weeks. You see, I&#8217;m traveling and working at the same time, so my plan was to find an apartment in Arequipa where I could simply plug in my computer and get some serious work done before heading off to my next location within the country.</p>
<p>So, just a few minutes after arriving in the city, I happened to run across a guy who owns one of the hostels here in town. 1) We got to talking and I told him about my desire to find a place to stay for the next few weeks. 2) He then told me he was leaving town for the next three weeks and that he was in need of a new website for his business. 3) I soon thereafter explained to the man that I design websites for a living!</p>
<p>As you can probably guess, this was when the magic happened.</p>
<p>After exchanging all of this information, a deal was quickly formed. I agreed to make the hostel owner a new website for his business&#8230; and in return he would let me stay in his apartment in downtown Arequipa while he was out of the country.</p>
<p><strong>In other words:</strong> In less than 5 minutes I had met a complete stranger off the street and exchanged my web design skills for his apartment in the city center.</p>
<p>In the end, I&#8217;ll spend just a few hours designing this man his new website&#8230; and I&#8217;ll save hundreds of dollars because I&#8217;m not paying a single cent for my lodging over the next three weeks.</p>
<p>Pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>But now I&#8217;m guessing you want to know how you can use this same strategy to obtain free hotel rooms and apartments for yourself.</p>
<h3>This Is How YOU Do It:</h3>
<p>The secret to obtaining free accommodations in this case is to simply trade one of your skills or services with a lodging owner. In other words, you simply trade a valuable skill that you possess for accommodations with another individual.</p>
<p>Now, you might not be a web designer who can create websites and work from anywhere in the world as long as there is an Internet connection. But maybe you are a massage therapist who could massage an entire hotel staff in exchange for a week-long stay in Honolulu, Hawaii.</p>
<p>Or maybe you are a plumber who could go in and repair a bed and breakfast&#8217;s leaky old basement pipe in exchange for a free night&#8217;s stay in Prague, Czech Republic?</p>
<p>Or maybe you are an accountant who could trade your bookkeeping services for an entire month&#8217;s stay in a high-rise hotel in Tokyo, Japan?</p>
<p>The possibilities here are endless. The trick is for your to simply determine whether or not you have any skills that you might be able to trade for free accommodations.</p>
<h3>The Advantage Of Trading Your Skills For Free Lodging:</h3>
<p>Whether you know it or not, this is just one of the strategies I talk about inside my <a title="free lodging guide" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/traveling-cyclists-guide-to-free-hotels-campgrounds/">guide to free lodging</a>, and it&#8217;s a powerful one that many people overlook.</p>
<p>If you paid close attention to everything written above, you will have noticed that I traded my skills as a web designer for a free 3-weeks stay in the city of Arequipa, Peru.</p>
<p>What you may have not really thought about, however, is just how much money I saved by doing this. And more importantly, you may have not realized just how much money YOU CAN SAVE  by taking this same approach while on your travels or in your every-day life.</p>
<p><strong>Consider this:</strong> I spend (on average) about $1,000 USD per month for my lodging expenses. With 30 days in a month, this breaks down to about $33 dollars per night.</p>
<p>With my free 3-weeks stay in Arequipa, that essentially knocks off 21 days within the 30-day month where I do not have to pay for a place to sleep.</p>
<p>So, if I multiply $33 dollars per night x 21 free nights in Arequipa, the end result is that <strong>I saved myself approximately $693 USD.</strong></p>
<p>To some people, that may not be a whole lot of money, but I bet that most of you reading this now would agree that you could do a lot with an extra $693 in your bank account.</p>
<p>This is the power of free lodging, and it&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so obsessed with <a title="free lodging tips and tricks" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/traveling-cyclists-guide-to-free-hotels-campgrounds/">getting free places to stay</a> whenever I possibly can.</p>
<p>For most people in the world, lodging is their #1 monthly expense. And for many people (myself included), their monthly lodging costs make up as much as 66% or more of their monthly expenditures.</p>
<p>Now, imagine using this technique that I&#8217;ve shared with you today to drastically reduce or even eliminate your lodging costs.</p>
<p>What would you do with all that extra money? Would you travel to a far off place? Extend your family vacation? Buy a new gadget or toy of some kind? Take a class you&#8217;ve always dreamt of taking? The options here are endless.</p>
<h3>Now Here&#8217;s My Challenge To You:</h3>
<p>Get creative, think outside the box, and determine which skills or services you possess that you could possibly trade for free (or deeply discounted) accommodations. Then, once you&#8217;ve determined the skills or services you can trade for free hotel rooms, campsites, apartments or whatever, go out and find a lodging owner willing to give you a free night&#8217;s stay in exchange for your unique skills or services.</p>
<p>Start by trading your skills or services for just a single night and then work your way up from there.</p>
<p>Give it a try&#8230; and let me know what kind of results you receive.</p>
