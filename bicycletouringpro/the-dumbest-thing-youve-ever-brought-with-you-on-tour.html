<h1>The Dumbest Thing You&#8217;ve Ever Brought With You On A Bike Tour</h1>
<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve done a lot of experimenting on my bike trips. Every trip has been different and I&#8217;ve brought different items with me on each of my tours.</p>
<p>After nearly eight years of bicycle touring, I&#8217;ve learned what I need to bring with me and what I should leave at home. And even though I&#8217;ve learned a lot over the years about some of the unnecessary items you might be temped to take with you on a bike tour, I&#8217;ll likely bring some more stupid things with me in the future.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I brought with me on tour, that I really did not need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A soft-case ice chest.</li>
<li>Tupperware</li>
<li>A full size tripod for my camera</li>
<li>A full 3-piece cook-set</li>
<li>A solar panel in Europe (The sun hardly ever came out and there was<br />
simply no need for a solar panel)</li>
<li>Aerobars</li>
<li>My cell phone when I went to Europe (It didn&#8217;t work at all and I had<br />
to carry it around the whole time)</li>
<li>Pepper spray (I&#8217;ve carried it on numerous tours and never used it.<br />
I won&#8217;t be carrying it anymore.)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are likely a lot of other stupid things I&#8217;ve brought with me, but I can&#8217;t think of them at the moment. I&#8217;ll think of them as time goes by and update you on my stupidity by posting in the comments section below.</p>
<p>One of my favorite stupid things I ever saw someone carrying with them on a bike tour was a stuffed jackalope. This rider was obviously carrying the stuffed animal as a joke, but this is quite possibly the stupidest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen strapped onto the back of a traveling cyclists bike.</p>
<p>Another favorite of mine is the Coconut Head that Ted Schredd carried with him on his tour around the United States.
