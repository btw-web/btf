<p>Want to make a positive change in your life? Then you need to do something catastrophically different and break the pattern!</p>
<p>Think about it? I bet there’s been a moment in your life when you decided, for one reason or another, to stop doing what you were doing, and do something differently. Maybe it was quitting your job, moving to a new city, making new friends, building a new relationship, changing your eating habits, or whatever. Or maybe you’ve never made a major change in your life, but you look back on things now and wish that you had.</p>
<p>My name is Darren Alff and I am the <a href="https://www.bicycletouringpro.com"><em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em></a>. For the last 17 years I have been riding my bicycle all around the world… and for the last ten years, I have been helping people from across the globe learn to conduct their own amazing bicycle touring adventures.</p>
<p>Bicycle touring has taught me a lot over the years, but I know that for me, some of the best things I’ve ever done in my life occurred when I decided I was going to break away from what I was doing… and start doing things differently.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong> At the age of 17, shortly after graduating from high school, I went away from home for the first time in my life and rode my bike with three of my best friends down the California coastline &#8211; from Oregon to Mexico. Turns out, that month-long bike tour would be just the first of more than 17 years of bicycle touring adventures all around the world.</p>
<p>Then, at the age of 22, just one year after graduating from college, I quit my job as a sound mixer in Hollywood and I bought a house in the state of Utah and moved there with no job, no friends, no family and no plan. But it was that move from California to Utah that gave me the time and perspective I needed to create <a href="https://www.bicycletouringpro.com"><em>www.BicycleTouringPro.com</em></a> &#8211; a project I’m extremely passionate about, and something that I believe, is making the world a better place.</p>
<p>Finally, after years of putting it off, I decided to sit down and write my book, “<a href="https://www.bicycletouringbook.com">The Bicycle Touring Blueprint</a>,” which I didn’t think anyone would be interested in at first, but which has now sold thousands and thousands of copies all around the world, and has helped thousands of people conduct the bicycle tour of their dreams.</p>
<p>So, that’s one of my big secrets for you: <strong>If you want your life to change, you’ve got to stop doing what you’re doing right now and do something catastrophically different.</strong></p>
<p>For many of the people I talk to and consult with on a daily basis, that potentially life-altering thing that they want to do is a bicycle tour. A <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/types-of-bicycle-tours/">self-supported bicycle tour</a> where they carry everything you need to survive on their bicycle for several days, weeks, months or years. It’s an exciting idea… and it’s something that appeals to a lot of people because it’s ultimately something that almost anyone can do &#8211; whether you’re young or old, rich or poor, and no matter where you happen to live in the world.</p>
<p><strong>There are a lot of good reasons to go bicycle touring!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do something new</li>
<li>Experience new places</li>
<li>Make new friends</li>
<li>Try new foods</li>
<li>Get into nature</li>
<li>Get away from the world</li>
<li>Daydream</li>
<li>Share a unique experience (with a loved one)</li>
<li>Challenge yourself</li>
<li>Get into shape.</li>
<li>Whatever you want!</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you’ve already considered the various reasons a bike tour might be an enjoyable and rewarding experience. And maybe you’ve even half-way considered making that catastrophic change in your life so that you can go off and conduct that once-in-a-lifetime bicycle tour you’ve been dreaming about? But if you’re like most people, you also have something, somewhere in the back of your head, that is preventing you from taking the leap and moving forward with your dream?</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether it’s money.</li>
<li>Work.</li>
<li>Pressure from friends or family.</li>
<li>Personal obligations.</li>
<li>Health issues.</li>
<li>Fear.</li>
<li>Or anything else.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re like most people, you have something that is preventing you from making the leap and actually taking the steps necessary to live the dream you’ve held in the back of your mind for so long.</p>
<p>A big part of what I do at <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> has to do with teaching people about <a href="http://www.touringbicyclebook.com">what kind of bike to ride</a>, what kind of gear to use, how to map out a safe and enjoyable cycling route, and things of that nature. But an even bigger, more important part of my job, is helping people overcome the various mental and personal obstacles that they have that are preventing them from conducting the bike tour of their dreams.</p>
<p>So, in my next video, I’m going to give you some of my best pieces of advice, that you can use right away, to overcome any objections you, your friends, family or loved ones might have about conducting the bike tour you’ve been dreaming about. I’m going to tell you how to raise the money for your bike tour, how to get the time off work, how to temporarily or permanently release yourself from any obligations you might have that are holding you back, how to overcome your fears, and how to conduct a bike tour of any length &#8211; regardless of your age, income or health status.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned for that next piece of information &#8211; which will be released in just a couple days (on Tuesday, February 21, 2017).</p>
<p>In the meantime, could you please do me a quick favor?</p>
