<h1>Don&#8217;t Criticize Me For Carrying A Spare</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">While cycling in Aruba recently, I came across a group of young Dutch boys standing in the middle of the road with a confused look upon their faces.</p>
<p>When I approached the group of five, one of the taller boys came towards me and said something in Dutch. I don’t know exactly what he said, but I knew what he wanted.</p>
<p>He and his friends had decided to go out on a bike ride and not a single one of them had thought to bring a pump, patch kit, tire levers, or spare tube. One of the boys had a flat tire and they wanted to know if they could use my tools to try and patch up the deflated tube.</p>
<p>Lucky for them I had come along at just the right time.</p>
<p>I gladly passed over my pump, patch kit, and tire levers. I would have given them a spare tube had I had one that would have fit inside their 26-inch mountain bike tires.</p>
<p>For the next ten to fifteen minutes the boys worked on the flat, trying to repair the damage… but were ultimately unsuccessful. I tried to help them with the patch job, but was confident that these young Dutch cyclists must know a thing or two about patching tubes themselves, so I didn&#8217;t interfere.</p>
<p>In the end, the boys had to use their cell phone to call a friend to come and pick them up in a car. They gave me 10 Aruban Florins for my trouble and snapped photos of me as I rode off on my strange looking folding bike.</p>
<p>The reason I tell this story is because I’ve received some criticism from other bicyclists in the past because I always leave on tour with at least two spare tubes in my possession.</p>
<p>“Why carry so many tubes when you can just patch up the tube you’ve got?” they say.</p>
<p>Well, I’ll tell you!</p>
<p>The reason I always carry at least two spare tubes is because I don’t want to the be the one stranded out in the middle of nowhere with a flat tire and no way of fixing it. On top of that, I simply hate trying to patch up a bicycle tube. I&#8217;d much rather grab a brand new tube and throw it in my tire and be down with it. Patch jobs make me nervous&#8230; and the last think I want to be when out on my bicycle is nervous!</p>
<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve come to the rescue of many cyclists who left home without a spare tube and found themselves with a flat tire and no way of fixing the flat or replacing it with a spare. Lucky for them, I always carry a couple spare tubes, so I was happy to help when I could.</p>
<p>The point I&#8217;m trying to make is that with something as important as your tires, you don&#8217;t want to chance being stuck out in the middle of nowhere with no other option but begging for someone to help you.</p>
<p>An important part of bicycle touring is that you do everything in your power to be as self-sufficient as possible. To me, being self-sufficient means having a backup plan. And a good backup plan on any bicycle tour involves carrying at least 2 spare tubes.</p>
<p>At least that&#8217;s what I think anyway&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
