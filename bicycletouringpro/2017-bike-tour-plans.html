<h1>My 2017 Bike Tour In Sweden, Norway &#038; Finland</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s time to announce the plans for <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/cycling-north-cape-nordkapp-norway/">my 2017 bike tour in Sweden, Norway and Finland</a>!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-36349" src="https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sweden-campsite-660x440.jpeg" alt="Sweden bike tour with tent and campfire" width="660" height="440" /></p>
<p>This summer I will be participating in a three-month long cycling adventure in some of Europe&#8217;s most northerly places &#8211; many of which are high above the Arctic Circle, where the sun never sets during the summer months and caribou, wolves, wolverine and bear run wild in a vast wilderness area known as <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/finland/lapland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lapland</a>.</p>
<p>My 2017 bike tour in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Norway and Finland is going to be an amazing adventure&#8230; and I can&#8217;t wait to share the experience with you here on the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> website and in the videos I plan to publish on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bicycletouringpro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my popular <em>YouTube</em> channel</a>.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here are the details for my 2017 summertime bike tour in Sweden, Norway and Finland:</p>
<h2>Fly to <span class="st">Umeå</span>, Sweden</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-36354" src="https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Umea-1-3-660x383.jpg" alt="Umea Sweden river and city center" width="660" height="383" /></p>
<p>On May 25th, 2017, I will fly from Los Angeles, California (in the United States) to <span class="st">Umeå</span>, Sweden (in northern Europe) for the start of my next big bicycle touring adventure. This will be my 17th consecutive year of bicycle touring all around the world&#8230; and I&#8217;ll be returning to a part of the world that I&#8217;ve both been to several times before and absolutely love.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve finished two previous long-distance bike tours in <span class="st">Umeå</span>, Sweden (in <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/biking-across-norway-sweden/">2015</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/wQlTKwxaeAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2016</a>)&#8230; but this year <span class="st">Umeå</span> will act as the home-base for my 2017 bike tour in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Norway and Finland.</p>
<p>I plan to spend just two nights in <span class="st">Umeå</span> at the start of my trip this year (to rest and recover from jetlag, while at the same time prepping my new <a href="http://co-motion.com/bikes/siskiyou" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Co-Motion Cycles Siskiyou</em> touring bicycle</a> for its maiden voyage.) After my bike is assembled and I&#8217;m all rested up from the long flight to Europe, the real bike tour will begin!</p>
<h2>Cycle from <span class="st">Umeå</span>, Sweden to Nordkapp, Norway</h2>
<p>After a couple days of rest and recovery in <span class="st">Umeå</span>, Sweden, I&#8217;ll begin <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/cycling-north-cape-nordkapp-norway/">cycling to the North Cape in Nordkapp, Norway</a> &#8211; mainland Europe&#8217;s most northerly point. Over the course of the following 25 days, I will cycle approximately 2,250 kilometers (1,400 miles) while sleeping in my tent in the middle of the forest on almost every single night of the trip. I&#8217;ll bathe in lakes and rivers and occasionally stop at small, local libraries to check my email and upload photos from the ride to the <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bicycletouring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Facebook</em></a> and <em><a href="http://www.instagram.com/bicycletouringpro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a></em> accounts.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-36350" src="https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-sweden-norway-finland-bike-tour-map-660x443.jpg" alt="Sweden to Norway bike tour map" width="660" height="443" /></p>
<p>The map above shows the approximate route I plan to take on my bike tour this year. I&#8217;ll begin by traveling north from <span class="st">Umeå</span>, Sweden and hooking up with the <a href="http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EuroVelo Sun Route</a>, which weaves a westerly path to Nordkapp, Norway. Once in Europe&#8217;s northern-most place, I&#8217;ll turn around and begin cycling south on the <a href="http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EuroVelo East Europe Route</a>, which winds its way through northern Finland and then back down to <span class="st">Umeå</span>, where my bike tour originally began.</p>
<p>In essence, I&#8217;m going in a big circle &#8211; from <span class="st">Umeå</span>, Sweden up to Nordkapp, Norway and then back to <span class="st">Umeå</span>, Sweden.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The map above is a custom map that I created for <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/cycling-north-cape-nordkapp-norway/">my 2017 bike tour in Sweden, Norway and Finland</a> using <em>Google MyMaps</em>. The yellow, blue and red/purple markers on the map indicate the location of libraries, supermarkets and various points of interest along my route.</p>

<h2>Work for 1.5 Months in <span class="st">Umeå</span>, Sweden</h2>
<p>After I finish the 25-day bike tour to Nordkapp, Norway, I&#8217;ve rented an apartment in the center of <span class="st">Umeå</span>, Sweden and I plan to stay there for approximately 45 days. During this time, I will be editing the photos and videos I shot during my 25-day bike ride to the north; I&#8217;ll be working to update &#8220;<a href="http://www.touringbicyclebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Essential Guide To Touring Bicycles</a>&#8221; so that the information in that book is the best it can possibly be; and I&#8217;ll be shooting a series of new videos to be included with the <a href="https://www.bicycletouringpro.com/coaching"><em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> video coaching program</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-36357" src="https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Apartment-in-Umea-Sweden-011-660x371.jpg" alt="colorful apartment buildings in Umea, Sweden" width="660" height="371" /></p>
<p>Plus, it will be fun just to live and work in such a beautiful part of the world. I have several friends that live and work in <span class="st">Umeå</span>, Sweden, so hopefully some of my time in the city will be spent visiting with these people and building those relationships.</p>
<h2>Bike Tour on the Baltic Sea Cycle Route</h2>
<p>After my 45 days in <span class="st">Umeå</span>, Sweden comes to a close, my friend Rob and a friend of his from work are going to meet me in <span class="st">Umeå</span> and we are going to spend approximately 7-10 days cycling north from <span class="st">Umeå</span> to the nearby city of Oulu, Finland (approximately 500 kilometers/310 miles away). <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2PtHu6hmFiT2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to see a map of the approximate route we plan to cycle</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-36355" src="https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/robs-finland-bike-tour-660x461.jpeg" alt="Roberto LoRusso Bicycle Touring Pro" width="660" height="461" /></p>
<p>This will be the 5th long-distance bike tour that Rob and I have done together over the last several years. We originally met in 2012 when we both participated in the <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/bike-switzerland-challenge-tour/"><em>Bike Switzerland Challenge Tour</em>.</a> Since that time, Rob and I have become good friends and have conducted three other bike tours together in France, Finland and Norway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to riding with Rob again&#8230; and I look forward to sharing the bike touring experience with Rob&#8217;s friend, Doug, who is going to be joining us on this week-long bicycle touring adventure in Nordic Europe.</p>
<h2>Tour The Western United States</h2>
<p>After my 90 days in <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/how-the-schengen-agreement-forced-me-to-change-my-european-travel-plans/">Schengen Europe</a> is up, I&#8217;ll fly back to Los Angeles, California where I will meet with my doctors again (I&#8217;m recovering from a <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/quit-bike-tour/">recent cancer diagnosis</a>) and go through a series of medical tests. Hopefully everything will be fine and I&#8217;ll be given a clean bill of health.</p>
<p>After that is finished, I plan to spend the next three to four months driving around the western United States in my brand new <em>Dodge Caravan</em>. I bought this van with the dream of using it as a sort of stealth bicycle touring camper van. The van is relatively fuel-efficient, big enough to carry two bikes inside and still have enough room to sleep in at night.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-36356" src="https://bicycletouringpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Car-Camping-in-Arizona-0611-660x429.jpg" alt="campervan bike tour wheelie" width="660" height="429" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you detailed tour of my new van at some point in the future, but for now, just know that this autumn I plan to spend three to four months driving around the western United States and stopping in some of the country&#8217;s most interesting and scenic locations. Once I find a place to park the van, I&#8217;ll load up my bicycle and take off on several short 3-10 day bike tours.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m already planning bike tours in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and Arizona. If you have suggestions on where exactly I should go or which routes you think I should cycle in these states, please leave a comment at the end of this article and let me know what you have to say!</p>
<p>The other hope I have for my camper-van/bike tour this autumn is that I will be able to meet up and possibly even ride with some of my <a href="https://www.bicycletouringpro.com"><em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em></a> readers who live in the United States. So, if you live in the western United States and you want to ride with me (or maybe even let me shower at your home), please get in touch!</p>
<h2>My 2017 Bike Tour Travel Plans</h2>
<p>So, there you have it! That&#8217;s a quick summary of what I have planned for the rest of the year. I&#8217;ll be cycling alone across Sweden, Norway and Finland for 25+ days. Then I&#8217;ll spend 45 days working and playing in <span class="st">Umeå</span>, Sweden. Then Rob and Doug and I will spent a week or so cycling across Sweden and Finland together. Then I&#8217;ll fly back to the United States and I&#8217;ll be traveling across the western portion of the country in my new van and stopping at some of the most interesting points along the way and conducting short 3-10 day bike tours in those areas.</p>
