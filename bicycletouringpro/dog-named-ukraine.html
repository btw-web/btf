<h1>A Dog Named Ukraine &#8211; The Story Of A Stray Dog That Followed Me For Two Days In The Eastern European Country Of Ukraine</h1>
<p>I spent the night sleeping in an orchard and woke up that morning in a dense fog. A fog so thick I could see only a few meters in front of me as I pedaled my fully-loaded bicycle down a series of long bumpy roads.</p>
<p>After stopping in my first Ukrainian town to stock up on food, water and a new foreign currency, I jumped back on my bicycle and pedaled north, cycling along a lonely dirt and gravel road near the border of Ukraine and the breakaway territory known as Transnistria.</p>
<p>It was here, no more than a half-kilometer from the border of these two countries, that I realized I was being followed.</p>
<p>But I wasn&#8217;t being followed by the Ukrainian, Moldovan, Russian or Transnistria border officials, police, of military personnel. I was being followed by a small brown dog!</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYn8-tOO7Mk" width="660" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I have no idea where the dog came from or why he started following me. During the two days the dog stayed with me, I never once attempted to give him any food or water (because I knew that doing so would make it even more difficult for the dog to leave me alone after that).</p>
<p>Due to the poor road conditions and the occasional uphill climb, it was extremely difficult for me to ditch the small dog (and trust me, I tried). During my time with Ukraine (which is what I started to call him after a while), I said goodbye to him more than a dozen different times&#8230; and saying goodbye wasn&#8217;t easy. It hurt me just as much as it hurt him. But just when I thought I had finally lost the little guy, he&#8217;d come running up the road in the distance behind me, yapping and crying and doing his best to pretend as though he wasn&#8217;t actually following me.</p>
<p>This continued for several hours on day one, and several more hours on day two.</p>
<p>I tried to find a local to take the dog, but no one I met along the way spoke any English. And when I did attempt to speak to someone about the dog, Ukraine would run off and hide. I&#8217;d point off into the bushes where I knew the dog was hiding, while the locals stared at me with a confused look on their faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand anything this guy is saying,&#8221; I imagined a local farmer saying to his wife. &#8220;And why does he keep pointing at that bush?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was my first night camping with Ukraine, however, that proved especially difficult.</p>
<p>I was nervous that having a dog in my campsite (a <a title="Wild camping and stealth camping" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/50-best-stealth-camping-tips/">wild camp</a>, no-less) would give away my location. But Ukraine was a very good dog. When I was setting up my tent, he kept himself busy by running around in the nearby bushes and (I assume) hunting for  food. He never barked and only occasionally whimpered.</p>
<p>When night fell, Ukraine curled up in a ball and fell asleep in the leaves outside my tent.</p>
<p>When I was woken up to the sound of rainfall a few hours later, I immediately thought of Ukraine. Peeking my head out of the tent into the cold, pitch-black night, I couldn&#8217;t see him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he ran away?&#8221; I thought to myself.</p>
<p>But when I got out of my tent a few minutes later (to relieve myself behind a nearby tree), I saw the poor little dog curled up in a ball underneath my bicycle&#8230; and he was absolutely drenched! Shaking wildly, crying and seemingly near death, I tried to pick the little dog up and carry him over to my tent. But Ukraine wouldn&#8217;t have it. He was still afraid of me and wouldn&#8217;t allow me to get near him.</p>
<p>The cold, however, seemed to have slowed him down, because it only took me a few seconds to chase him through the woods, grab him in my arms and carry him over to my campsite.</p>
<p>Once I had him inside the rain-fly, he ran off one or two more times before he finally took a seat and settled in for the night. He made no attempt to dry himself off or get warm. He left that to me. I tried to dry him as best I could before I eventually went to sleep with the little brown dog laying just a few inches away from me in the dry protected area underneath my tent&#8217;s rain-fly.</p>
<p>In the morning, Ukraine was still there. He was dry, but freezing &#8211; as was I. With temperatures well below zero degrees Celsius, I slowly packed up camp and hit the road again. As you might expect, Ukraine kept with me.</p>
<p>I knew that this couldn&#8217;t continue forever. I liked having company for once (I really did), but I was planning to ride my bicycle all the way to Germany &#8211; more than 1,700 kilometers away. And along the way I would be staying in hotels, renting apartments, cycling through the snow, crossing international borders and a whole lot more. There was no way I could bring a dog with me &#8211; even if I wanted to. I knew that at some point, I needed to say goodbye to the poor little puppy dog and go back to being on my own.</p>
<p>Over the next several hours I tried to leave Ukraine time and time again, but he just kept catching up with me. It was a terribly emotional time for both me and the dog.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, I hit a flat smooth road and Ukraine and I parted ways.</p>
<p>Ukraine had traveled with me for more than 50 kilometers and I wondered where he would go next. Would he lay in the bushes and rest for a while? Would he simply start following the next person to come along? Or would he follow my scent and come running up behind me hours, maybe even days later?</p>
<p>In the hours after leaving Ukraine behind, I kept looking back and half-way expecting that little brown dog to be running up the road far off in the distance. But I never saw Ukraine again. I continued cycling north&#8230; and I hope (I really do) that my little brown travel companion is somewhere safe, dry and warm.</p>
