<h1>In Search Of Cantaloupe &#8211; A Cycling Story</h1>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8281" title="cantelope" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/09/cantelope-588x384.jpg" alt="cut cantelope" width="588" height="384" /></p>
<p>7:30 a.m. A day out of Bar Harbor on a bicycle trip to Illinois. I pedaled over to a produce stand and asked if they had any cantaloupe.</p>
<p>“Why, this is a produce stand, son.”</p>
<p>“I can sell you a pepper&#8230;”</p>
<p>“I can sell you a head o&#8217; lettuce&#8230;”</p>
<p>“I can sell you beans.”</p>
<p>“I can&#8217;t sell you no&#8230;”</p>
<p>“cantaloupe.”</p>
<p>“You need a fruit stand if you want a&#8230;”</p>
<p>“cantaloupe.”</p>
<p>It was John and Jr. who taught me that fruit and produce don&#8217;t go together.</p>
<p>“They&#8217;re too different to sell together.”</p>
<p>“If we sold fruit, we&#8217;d be a fruit stand&#8230;”</p>
<p>“and if you sell fruit and produce&#8230;”</p>
<p>“why, then you&#8217;re a market&#8230;”</p>
<p>“and we don&#8217;t want to expand.”</p>
<p>“Uncontrolled growth is trouble.”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re simple people.”</p>
<p>John and Jr. were father and son. Side by side, finishing each other&#8217;s thoughts. Overalls over flannel shirts and bandanas in their pockets. Heavy workboots well taken care of. The hands of produce-men.</p>
<p>“Would you like some water for your bottles?”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s well water.”</p>
<p>“We have the best well in Maine.”</p>
<p>“The coldest, too.”</p>
<p>“Some people buy those&#8230;”</p>
<p>“water purification machines.”</p>
<p>“But we don&#8217;t.”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t need it.”</p>
<p>“We have the best well in Maine.”</p>
<p>“The coldest, too.”</p>
<p>Jr. took the bottles into the house to fill them.</p>
<p>“Sure is a fancy bicycle you have there. Why, we never had anything like that when I was younger. Had a big balloon-tired bicycle. One speed. I used it to court Jr.&#8217;s mother. Yep, I used to ride that bicycle all over these hills. When Jr. got old enough he&#8217;d sit on my shoulders and we&#8217;d ride for hours. I never got tired, not then.Course, we don&#8217;t do that much anymore.”</p>
<p>John was about 85 and Jr. some twenty years younger; the hills were much older than either of them and about as steep as the angle of John&#8217;s nose, which seemed to be getting longer with every new word.</p>
<p>Jr. came back with the filled bottles.</p>
<p>“Is that bicycle still in the barn, Jr.? We haven&#8217;t been on a ride in a while  It&#8217;s about time we pumped those tires up and went for a ride. Haven&#8217;t been to Camden in a while now, we could ride there. Whatdya think, Jr.?”</p>
<p>By this time, the twinkle in John&#8217;s eye had gone supernova.</p>
<p>“Sounds like fun, Dad, but if you think I&#8217;m going to push you up those hills like I used to&#8230; Why I&#8217;d just as soon stay home and mind the stand.”</p>
<p>They were talking to each other but looking at me.</p>
<p>“Besides, I want my own bicycle. It&#8217;s none too comfortable on your shoulders. Produce is good we can afford another bike. It&#8217;s about time I learned to ride on my own.”</p>
<p>“Why have two bicycles when we can get by just fine on one? If you want to pedal so much, I&#8217;ll ride on your shoulders.”</p>
<p>“If you think I&#8217;m riding around town with you on my shoulders, you&#8217;re a bit touched. What would Mother have thought if you had come courting with Granddad on your shoulders? No sir, I&#8217;ll ride my own bicycle, thank you very much.”</p>
<p>For another twenty minutes, seemed like five, John and Jr. discussed their many rides together on that single bicycle. And then it was time to go.</p>
<p>I asked if they knew where I could find a fruit stand.</p>
<p>There weren&#8217;t any around, they said none of any merit, anyway. But how would I like a tomato?</p>
<p>“Tomatoes are really a fruit, you know.”</p>
<p>They carried tomatoes, a concession to the expansionists.</p>
<p>Armed with a tomato “Have a squash on the house.”</p>
<p>“Did I mention how squash is the most versatile type of produce?”</p>
<p>&#8230;and a squash</p>
<p>&#8230;and the best well water in Maine</p>
<p>&#8230;the coldest, too!</p>
<p>I pedaled off in search of cantaloupe.</p>
