<h1>&#8220;Been There, Done That&#8221; &#8211; What These Four Words Really Mean &#038; Why You Should Consider Never Saying Them Ever Again</h1>
<p>I absolutely hate it when I hear people say, &#8220;Been there, done that.&#8221; There are so many things to dislike about the expression&#8230; and here&#8217;s why I suggest you remove it from your vocabulary:</p>
<p>While the phrase, &#8220;Been there, done that&#8221; is an expression used to signal that one has been in a similar situation before, it is (more frequently than not) used to say that whatever the other person is saying or experiencing is nothing new to you. In other words, it&#8217;s kind of a back-handed way of saying that you don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-26084" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2014/09/doh-idiot-expression.jpg" alt="man hitting himself in the head" width="660" height="495" /></p>
<p>As a travel writer, I hear this all the time. I&#8217;ll post a photo or a story from my travels in some location around the world (or I&#8217;ll share something that one of my friends or students has accomplished) and some <del>idiot</del> person will come along and say, &#8220;Been there, done that.&#8221;</p>
<p>This person, I realize, is just trying to make themselves feel better&#8230; or boast about their own accomplishments. But when someone shares something with you and you say, &#8220;Been there, done that&#8221; you are basically telling the person that &#8220;This isn&#8217;t interesting or important to me. I don&#8217;t care. Let&#8217;s skip this topic.&#8221; Or &#8220;I already know this.&#8221; It&#8217;s just a rude way of ending the conversation.</p>
<p>Blowing someone off with a &#8220;Been there, done that&#8221; statement isn&#8217;t just downright rude, it&#8217;s a statement that says a lot about you. If, for example, I post a photo from my travels and you respond by saying, &#8220;Been there, done that,&#8221; you&#8217;re actually telling me a number of different things about who you are and how you think about the world:</p>
<ol>
<li>You&#8217;ve been to the same place I have. <em>Fantastic!</em></li>
<li>Instead of asking me about my experience, you talk about yourself. You don&#8217;t care enough about me to express interest in something I am obviously interested in, passionate about, or involved with.</li>
<li>You&#8217;re telling me you think that just because you&#8217;ve been in a similar situation, that you somehow know it all; that my experiences are exactly like your own; and that there is nothing more to learn or add to the conversation.</li>
<li>When you say, &#8220;Been there, done that&#8221; (especially in a travel context), it demonstrates that you think of life (and travel) as some kind of one-dimensional checklist that simply gets marked off as you go along.</li>
</ol>
<p>While I do think it&#8217;s impolite to say, &#8220;Been there, done that&#8221; in almost any situation (because it&#8217;s a terribly rude conversation ender), I think it&#8217;s even more foolish to say such a thing because it tells the world in four short words that you think you know it all, when obviously, <em>you do not!</em></p>
<p><strong>What do you think? Am I right about this? Or wrong? How do you feel when you hear someone say, &#8220;Been there. Done that.&#8221; Is there ever a time when it&#8217;s appropriate to say such a thing? Leave a comment below and let me know what you have to say.</strong></p>
