<p>If you've ever gone on a trip and come home with a camera full of terrible, uninspiring photographs... then please keep reading. I wrote this article just for you!</p>
<p>Over the next several minutes I am going to teach you about a simple photo-taking concept called "The Rule Of Thirds" that, if you put it to use, will dramatically improve your <a title="how to take better travel photos" href="http://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=741287&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=39781&amp;cl=93818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel photos</a> and ensure that you come home from you next travel adventure with a camera full of captivating images.</p>
<p>To start, let me explain something: For the past several months I have been traveling through Peru by myself. I have a camera with me (of course)... but because I'm alone, I have no one else to take my picture as I slowly travel about. Because of this, I'm forced to ask strangers to take my photo - strangers who have no idea what The Rule Of Thirds is or how to properly frame a photograph.</p>
<p><strong>HERE'S PROOF: Just look at the following 3 photos that strangers on my travels have taken of me:</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-9281" title="terribe travel photo" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2011/02/1-588x390.jpg" alt="terrible travel photo in lima peru" width="660" height="438" /></p>

<p>Pretty terrible photos, right?</p>
<p>I've pretty much come to terms with the fact that after this trip is over, I'll have very few good photos of myself in Peru.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that my eyes are obviously closed in the third image and the picture is slightly out of focus, these three photos do a good job of summarizing the terrible photos I get in return when I ask other people to take my picture. And I'm sick of it!</p>
<p>That's why I decided to write this post - To teach people about The Rule Of Thirds and the simple art of framing a photograph.</p>
<p>I'll explain more about The Rule Of Thirds in just a moment. But before I do that, take a look at these photos I've taken during my travels in Peru... and note the difference between these photos here and he ones pictures above.</p>

<p>Now, I'm not the best photographer in the world (I'll be quick to admit that), but I'm pretty sure the photos I've taken are a whole lot better than the ones other people on my travels have taken of me.</p>
<p>Do you see the difference between the first 3 photos I shared with you and the 7 travel photos pictured above?</p>
<p>If not, let me explain!</p>
<p>The main difference between the crappy photos at the top of this article and the images I just shared with you is that the images I shot were shot using a concept known as "The Rule Of Thirds."</p>
<p>In order to best explain this concept, let's take another look at that first crappy photo I shared with you.</p>
