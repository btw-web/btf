<p><strong>Agustin, where exactly did you go during your bicycle tour and how many days you were on the road for?</strong></p>
<p>It started as a one month trip that extended into five. I began cycling in Zagreb, Croatia and ended up in Capadoccia, Turkey. That was the first part of the trip. I needed to return to Madrid to catch my flight to Mexico afterward and since I wanted to visit some friends I flew from Istanbul to Brussels, Belgium and cycled my way down to Madrid after that. I visited, in this order, the following countries: Croatia, Serbia Bulgaria, Turkey, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, France and Spain.</p>
<p><strong>What was your biggest fear when planning your trip by bike? And how exactly did you overcome that fear?</strong></p>
<p>Where to sleep, what to eat, safety on the road, solitude&#8230; I was afraid of everything! I read extensively about bike touring. Your Bicycle Touring Pro website helped me decide I could do it. Then, once on the field, three great friends I met through <a title="Warm Showers" href="http://www.warmshower.org" target="_blank">WarmShowers.org</a> taught me all they knew over three fantastic days and helped me gain confidence and trust myself.</p>
<p><strong>What was the thing you liked most about your bicycle touring experience?</strong></p>
<p>Accomplishing the goal of a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>What one piece of information inside &#8220;The Bicycle Traveler&#8217;s Blueprint&#8221; helped you the most in planning, preparing for, or executing your bicycle tour?</strong></p>
<p>The information packing and equilibrium among the panniers was specially useful. That helped me a lot!</p>
<p><strong>Do you think you&#8217;ll conduct more bicycle tours in the future? If so, where do you want to go?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe. I&#8217;d like to cycle from home in Mexico to the tip of Argentina.</p>
<p><strong>What one piece of advice would you give to someone who is planning their first bicycle touring adventure?</strong></p>
<p>Always procure to sleep somewhere you feel safe. If something doesn&#8217;t feel quite right, just go a bit further. It&#8217;ll be worth it.</p>
