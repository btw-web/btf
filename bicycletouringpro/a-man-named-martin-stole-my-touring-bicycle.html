<p>Just moments before entering the Black Sea beach town of Tsarevo, Bulgaria, I saw a mountain biker coming up the road in my direction. As we drew closer to one another, the man approached and asked if I knew where he might be able to find some dirt trails to ride on. I wasn&#8217;t sure how to answer the man, because I didn&#8217;t know the area myself, but I told him that he we sure to find some dirt roads in the area I had just come from. So that was it. We went in different directions and I never expected to see the man again.</p>
<p>But a little further down the road I looked back and saw that the same man on his mountain bike had turned around and was now following me. He approached and asked where I was going. I told him I was headed north toward Varna&#8230; and he then asked if he could ride with me for a while.</p>
<p>Ready for company, but also ready for a short lunch break, I said &#8220;yes,&#8221; but also let the man know that I hadn&#8217;t eaten yet and that I was very hungry. So my new friend (his name was Martin) and I rode to the next town up the road (Lorents) where we found a small street-side cafe where I ordered a cheesy vegetable lasagne-like meal.</p>
<p>After eating, Martin still wanted to continue riding with me&#8230; and he didn&#8217;t want to just ride with me, but he wanted to ride my touring bicycle as well!</p>
<p>I am super hesitant about letting anyone touch my bicycle, let alone ride it. But Martin seemed incredibly trustworthy and I was surprisingly laid back about letting him ride my fully-loaded touring bicycle for a few kilometers. Plus, as part of the deal, I got to ride Martin&#8217;s lightweight mountain bike in exchange. Boy did his bicycle seem light after riding my heavy rig all the way from Istanbul!</p>
<p>Martin ended up riding with me for the rest of the day. He didn&#8217;t actually steal my touring bicycle. We just switched bikes for a few hours. He rode on my touring bicycle and I rode on his mountain bike. We passed through several Black Sea beach towns and he even helped me find a place to stay that night in the charming little town of Primorsco. When Martin finally said goodbye and began his bike ride back to Tsarevo that evening, I was sure it would be the last time I would ever see him. But there&#8217;s more to this story. So stay tuned for my next update from the road.</p>
