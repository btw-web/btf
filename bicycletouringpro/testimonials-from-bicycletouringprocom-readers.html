<p style="text-align: justify;">I would just like to thank you for all the help you have given on your site over the last couple of months. I live in London and am planning a round the world bike ride leaving Britain in September. It will be a 2-year trip of a lifetime. I have had so much information from your site. You have helped with tent selection, pannier packing and just general information that has been amazing. Thank you once again. You have helped to make a dream come true. Great site Darren. Please add more! Thank you for all your help and advice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would say <em>BicycleTouringPro.com</em> has been a huge help for me &#8211; a beginning wannabe tourer. The information I have received has been invaluable, not only in preparation, but in building my confidence to a level where I know I can complete a tour with confidence. Darren&#8217;s willingness to personally respond to my questions has led me to view this site as one of my most important bicycle related resources. Also, Darren&#8217;s advice on handlebar bags and helpfulness when I purchased my <em><a title="Lone Peak Alta 100 Handlebar Bag" href="https://www.bicycletouringpro.com/store/products/handlebarbags/index.php">Lone Peak Alta</a></em> through his site was great&#8211;and that bag is the best thing I&#8217;ve added to my bike to date!</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that I have actually had an opportunity to put your wisdom to use on the road with a tour I did with my son, I can say that all the information you have given on your website is useful. In particular the video of how and what to pack in the panniers was extremely helpful. My tour with my son was very fun and successful thanks to your helpful information! In fact, I was just mentioning your site to a friend of mine who just bought a touring bike. I told her she should check it out because your information is very good and practical. Us newbies need people like you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a wealth of information on your website. I am grateful that you put the time and effort into sharing it. I have learned a great deal.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m training for a cross country ride in honor of my 60th birthday and I found your website while looking around the web for all the good advice I can get. Your site looks great! Thanks!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks for your wonderful website. I am planning a bike trip from Scarsdale, NY to Canada and around Vermont. I enjoy reading material on your site because it is immensely practical. It gives me a sense of what is possible and has built up my confidence to take longer trips. Keep up the good work!</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you Darren. I&#8217;m new to touring so I can learn a lot from you! I&#8217;ve just finished building my new touring bike and I&#8217;m hopeing to take it around Ireland this summer. Thanks for all your help through your website. The video section is great and it gives a much clearer insight on how to do things right. Thanks for a great site!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Darren, I just wanted to say that I&#8217;ve been traveling by bike for a number of years&#8230; but I love the way you give a more age-appropriate approach to traveling by bike. I&#8217;m looking forward to what you have planned for the site in the future. Good work!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Hey Darren, I am a big fan of your website. It has been so helpful for the planning of my first trip this summer. My friends and family are starting to check out your website. The more they know the more they feel better. I decided to go all out on my first trip. I want to go coast to coast in Canada. It is a big and long trip, but I have the time and determination. Your website has made me so excited to start my trip&#8230; thanks!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hey Darren: I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate your taking the time to sit down and go over what actually goes into the all the touring bags and how to pack them. Your commentary on placing all the bags in the same place both on the bike and off (in the tent) as well as putting everything inside the same bag every time has helped me a lot!! Please keep up the good work. I am anxious to see what you will do next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am continuing to enjoy your site/blog. I have viewed many if not all of your videos on touring and packing panniers, etc. for bike touring. You have definitely succeeded in getting me excited about this touring season. Thanks for all of the work that you do to video your trips and the excellent web site that you have. It is truly one of the best that is out there.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">(Before) Hey Darren, I just wanted to tell you how helpful your site has been. I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of research in preparation for my first ever bike tour (TransAmerica) and your site has been one of the best resources out there. Thanks for everything you do!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(After) I just arrived home from my bike trip today after a 3 day train ride home undoing all the cycling I did over the last two months. It was my first tour, from San Francisco to D.C., and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next one. Thanks again for your help! Your advice proved invaluable on my tour and I hope you continue to inspire future generations of touring cyclists.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally there is a fantastic website on Bicycle Touring. Before I left on my first tour &#8211; I had absolutely no idea what to bring or what to expect. If only this website was around I wouldn&#8217;t have had so many &#8216;issues&#8217;. Darren is truly passionate about touring and that shows through on his site. If you are into Bike Touring &#8211; bookmark this site now so that you can get the items and support that you need.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I really do want to thank you for all your great information. You&#8217;ve mentioned a lot of good stuff on your site. I found a great deal of information on how to pack my panniers. I will use this information on my rides. It&#8217;s kind of funny because I always thought I knew how to pack everything, but you showed me the proper way. I always enjoy going to your site. If I have any questions about touring and If I can&#8217;t find something I can e-mail you and get a very quick response. Thanks so much and keep up the great work!</p>
