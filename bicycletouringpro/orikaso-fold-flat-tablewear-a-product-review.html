<h1>Orikaso Fold Flat Tablewear: A Product Review</h1>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-4011 alignright" title="orikaso-flat-fold-cookwear" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2009/12/orikaso-flat-fold-cookwear.jpg" alt="orikaso-flat-fold-cookwear" width="334" height="315" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a title="Orikaso Foldware" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EDKJT4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bicycletouringpro-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001EDKJT4">Orikaso flat fold tablewear</a> is one unique product! Likely a play on the word &#8220;origami,&#8221; which is the art of folding paper into a variety of decorative forms, Orikaso is a product made of flat colored plastic that can be folded into an entire table set &#8211; plate, cup and bowl.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s a great idea for people who spend large amounts of time in the outdoors. Bowls and cups, especially, are known to take up large amounts of space inside a loaded backpack or set of panniers, so the ability to have these items fold flat while in transport and then pop out during meal time is certainly appealing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately, as extraordinary as this colorful cook-set might appear, it has a number of flaws that, for me at least, rules it out as any kind of viable tableware.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My biggest complaint about the <a title="Orikaso camping set" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EDKJT4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bicycletouringpro-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001EDKJT4">Orikaso flatware set</a> is that even when folded flat, the set takes up just as much (if not more) space as my normal pot and cup. When pressed flat, the set measures nearly 10.5 inches x 10.5 inches. It&#8217;s weight is also nearly equal to that of the pot I use on most of my camping and bicycle touring expeditions. If the set could be folded down to such a size that it fit inside my wallet, then we might have something here. But at the current moment, I see little to no space or weight savings with the Orikaso tablewear set.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Additionally, I find the folding process somewhat difficult. Even after you get used to folding and unfolding the set, the process is somewhat frustrating. The cup, with it&#8217;s complex handle, is especially difficult to assemble. After a long day of hiking and/or biking, the last thing I want to do is struggle over the assembly of my plates, cups and bowls. I just want to eat!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lastly, I have to make note of the fact I&#8217;ve never used a separate plate, cup or bowl on any of my outdoor adventures. I usually carry water in a bottle and drink straight out of the bottle&#8230; and I cook in a single pot, which I use as my eating bowl, plate, and cup. I understand that not everyone will take this same approach to outdoor eating, but I doubt that few serious outdoorsmen worry about eating off a plate at the end of a long day of exploration.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In summary, I think the <a title="flat folding camping cups and bowls" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EDKJT4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bicycletouringpro-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001EDKJT4">Orikaso flatware</a> idea is a good one, but it simply needs to be refined. If the product were lighter and could be folded down to fit inside the palm of my hand, there might really be something here. Otherwise, I see this product as something one buys, uses once, and then never uses again. Either that, or it is the perfect gift for that outdoorsy person in your family who seems to have everything.</p>
