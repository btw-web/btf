<h1>GU Energy Gels: Have You Ever Used Them?</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7700" title="gu energy gels" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/08/gugells.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="358" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you ever seen those energy gel packets at the supermarket or in your local bike shop?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had seen them in the past, but I had never actually tried any of them for myself. That is, until I was recently sent a sampler packet for the entire line of GU energy products.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inside the sampler pack were 2 GU Electrolyte Brews, 1 GU Recovery Brew, 2 GU Chomps, 9 different GU Energy Gels, and 3 Roctane Ultra Endurance Enery Gel packets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The company sent this to me in hopes that I would write a review on my website and share my findings with you, but the truth is, I don&#8217;t really know how to review a product like this. I just don&#8217;t know that much about the products and I feel a little uncomfortable reviewing food products as a whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, here&#8217;s the deal: I want to know what you think of these things.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Have you ever used GU energy products for yourself?</li>
<li>Do  you use them now? If so, what do you think?</li>
<li>Have they given you more energy?</li>
<li>Do you think they increase your athletic abilities?</li>
<li>Do you like or dislike how they taste?</li>
<li>Do you think they are healthy and safe?</li>
<li>What do you think of the products overall?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve tried a few of the products thus far and I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about them. I was raised with a doctor father who told me that I shouldn&#8217;t eat something unless I can recognize all the ingredients in it. And while that is getting harder and harder to do in today&#8217;s world of processed foods, there are a few ingredients in these GU products that I am certainly unfamiliar with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The texture of the gels is another thing I feel a bit torn about. When I opened my first packet of GU Energy Gel, I expected it to have a texture very much like that of yogurt, but the gel was a whole lot thicker than that (more like glue)&#8230; and a whole lot sweeter. The gels I have tried thus far have all tasted pretty good (my favorite is the Strawberry Banana energy gel), but the texture is strange. It might just be one of those things that you have to get used to. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, since I don&#8217;t feel comfortable reviewing a product such as this, I&#8217;d like to hear what you think. Leave a comment below and let me know if you&#8217;ve used these products in the past, what you think of them, and tell me whether or not products such as these are something you would recommend for others. I look forward to hearing what you have to say!</p>
