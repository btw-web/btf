<h1>Why I&#8217;ve Gone Bicycle Touring Every Single Year For The Past 14 Years In A Row</h1>
<p>That&#8217;s right! Every single year, for the last fourteen years in a row, I&#8217;ve packed up my bicycle, left the safety and comfort of my home, and gone off on a bicycle touring adventure of some kind. I&#8217;ve pedaled thousands of miles, cycled across dozens of countries all around the world, spent countless nights sleeping in a tent, and have made hundreds of friends all across the planet.</p>
<p>I started bicycle touring at the age of 17. At the time I had never even heard of anyone riding a bicycle over extremely long distances. I didn&#8217;t know what <a title="what is bicycle touring?" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/what-exactly-is-bicycle-touring/">bicycle touring</a> was, nor did I know about all the special gear made for long-distance cycling. I was a total newbie, but I had this wild idea that I was going to ride my father&#8217;s old mountain bike from Oregon to Mexico down the California coastline. It would be the first time in my life I had ever been away from home for more than a day or two, and it would be the first time I ever did something truly on my own. Just the thought of it was frightening and exhilarating all at the same time.</p>
<p>But you know what? I completed that first bicycle tour with ease. It took me only 30 days to pedal my rusty old bike to the Mexican-American border&#8230; and by the time I got there, I was hooked!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/05/sierraschwinntouringbike.jpg" alt="Darren Alff's first bicycle tour in 2001" width="660" height="494" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This is a photo of me on my first long-distance bicycle tour &#8211; </em><br />
<em>cycling from Oregon to Mexico down the California coastline. </em></p>
<p>At the start of that first bicycle tour, I never imagined that long-distance bicycle touring was something I would soon be making a regular part of my life. But the open road called to me each summer during my time in University. When my friends were working low-paying jobs during their short summer breaks, I was off riding my bicycle in some corner of North America. And when my college career came to an end, I started cycling overseas. Year after year my bicycle touring adventures continued.</p>
<p>For the first few years, I kept telling myself that I would only do one more bicycle tour and then that would be the end of it. But year after year, the open road kept calling my name.</p>
<p>It has been fourteen years now since I started my bicycle touring adventures and I&#8217;m just as excited by the idea of cycling through an unknown part of the world as when I first started cycling in my teens.</p>
<p>The truth is, however, I do get a little tired of cycling sometimes. On my latest long-distance bicycle tour, I was away from home for more than 14 months &#8211; during which time I cycled through 24 different countries on three different continents. I spent six months of that time sleeping on the ground in my tent; I was alone for the great majority of that trip (about a year); and every decision made (about where I was going to sleep, what roads I was going to take, which foods I was going to eat, etc) was entirely up to me. It was wonderful and lonely and tiring all at once.</p>
<p>By the time I finished <a title="bicycle touring in swaziland" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/photos-swaziland/">my bicycle tour in southern Africa</a>, I was exhausted. The idea of simply going home, taking off my shoes, and not moving for a good month or two sounded superb. So that&#8217;s exactly what I did!</p>
<p>In early July, 2013, I made my way home and settled into my condo in the mountains of Park City, Utah: a 1-bedroom, 1-bath condominium I bought for myself when I was just 22-years old.</p>
<p>It felt good to be back &#8220;home.&#8221; But the weird thing about traveling so much is that home doesn&#8217;t always feel like home when the road has been your home for so very long.</p>
<p>I settled in to my normal, sedentary life. I shopped for food at the local market, went to the bank and the post office, ate at all the restaurants I was so familiar with, and tried to get re-involved in the local community (I played on a curling team, joined a table-tennis club, and went hiking with some of the friends I had left behind more than a year ago). For the first month or two, it felt great to be back home!</p>
<p>But somewhere around month three or four, I began to fall into the trap I imagine many people fall into. The days started to go by more quickly, I lost track of time, I wasn&#8217;t accomplishing as much as I would have liked to, and I realized I wasn&#8217;t as happy at home as I thought I would be.</p>
<p>When I was out on the road, I occasionally dreamed of being at home &#8211; walking around barefoot, sitting by the fire, and taking a warm shower every single day (a luxury I rarely get when I am bicycle touring in many parts of the world). But now that I was home and had all those things that I had been missing on my travels, now all I wanted to do was get back out on the road &#8211; spend all day thinking, pushing myself up massive hills, meeting strangers and turning them into friends, and sleeping in my tent each night.</p>
<p>When I returned to my Utah home in July of 2013, my plan was to stay there until May, 2014, and then go on another big bicycle tour at that time. But I was getting anxious and the weather was turning. It was December now and the weather was getting cold. Snow had fallen and the local ski season had begun. But I hadn&#8217;t purchased a ski pass, so I was stuck indoors and wishing I was back on my bike, traveling the world, and having another big adventure.</p>
<p>It seems strange to say this now, but that&#8217;s when I saw the trailer for the new movie, <em>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</em>. If you haven&#8217;t seen the trailer yet, I encourage you to watch it now.</p>
<p><object width="660" height="660" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6, 0, 40, 0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="//www.youtube.com/v/ZGLEuukSFDo?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;showinfo=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="660" height="660" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="//www.youtube.com/v/ZGLEuukSFDo?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;showinfo=0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" /></object></p>
<p>The trailer shows a middle-age man stuck in a boring desk job, who dreams of escaping and going off on a wild adventure. At the point in the trailer where Sean Penn waves Benn Stiller&#8217;s character over to him, I knew what I was going to do. I was sitting at home, watching a trailer for the latest Hollywood blockbuster, but it was that one moment that would change my winter plans entirely.</p>
<p>The very next day I listed my condo for rent and two days after that had found a renter. I signed a contract and my condo was gone. I rented it out for an entire year &#8211; thus freeing me up to hit the road once more and live out my bicycle touring dreams!</p>
<p>I just announced <a title="my bicycle touring plans for 2014" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/my-plans-for-2014/">my bicycle touring travel plans for 2014</a>, so if you haven&#8217;t already read that article, I encourage you to give it a quick glance right now.</p>
<p>This year I will be cycling through at least 14 different countries (and maybe even more than that). I will be traveling alone at times, but I&#8217;m making an effort to find others to join me for certain parts of my journey. I&#8217;m sad to leave my home in Utah behind, but excited about the adventures that lay ahead. 2014 is going to be an incredible year!</p>
<p>But why do I keep doing this to myself?</p>
<p>Why do I continue to go bicycle touring year after year, even when it occasionally wears me out and is frequently such a lonely endeavor.</p>
<p>The truth is, <strong>I return to bicycle touring year after year because it is so incredible memorable.</strong></p>
<p>When I look back over the last fourteen years, there isn&#8217;t a whole lot that I remember. I mean, I can remember where I went on my bicycle tours, but I don&#8217;t remember much else.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know where I was for the holidays in 2002; I don&#8217;t know what TV shows I watched in 2005; and I don&#8217;t remember what new clothes I bought in 2007.</p>
<p>But you know what I do remember?</p>
<p>I remember every single bicycle tour I&#8217;ve ever been on&#8230; and I remember hundreds of magical moments from those bicycle adventures!</p>
<p>If you were to ask me what I did in 2005, I would be able to quickly tell you about my bicycle tour through Canada, Washington and Oregon states, but I wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell you much else. It&#8217;s only after mentioning my bicycle tour that I would remember that 2005 was the year I graduated from University. But the fact that I graduated from college would come second to my bicycle tour! In other words, I remember my travels by bike far more than I remember anything else.</p>
<p>In fact, my bicycle tours are how I remember just about everything. Name a year and I can tell you where I was that year because of my bicycle tours. My travels by bike are a clear picture in my mind, whereas everything else is more of a haze.</p>
<p>So when I sit down and think about the reason I&#8217;ve gone bicycle touring every single year for the last fourteen years in a row, that&#8217;s the first thing that comes to mind: <strong>I go bicycle touring year after year because it is so incredibly memorable&#8230; and I want to do as many memorable things in life as I possibly can.</strong></p>
