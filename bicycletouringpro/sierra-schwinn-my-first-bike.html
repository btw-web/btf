<h1>The Sierra Schwinn &#8211; My First Bike</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6075" title="sierraschwinntouringbike" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/05/sierraschwinntouringbike.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="494" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What do you remember about your first bicycle?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My first bike was a silver BMX bike that I rode to school when I was in fifth and sixth grade. My next door neighbor and best friend, Matt Bockal, had a matching bike and we thought we were pretty darn cool because we could jump off six inch street curbs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I entered my teens, my parents bought me a Giant mountain bicycle, but it never really grew on me. The bike felt  funny and I never really liked to ride it. It just didn&#8217;t feel like me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, in 2001, when I began making plans for my first long-distance bike tour down the California coastline, I started thinking about the bike I would ride on my journey down the coast. The obvious answer would have been to ride my Giant, as it was really the only bike I had&#8230; and it was in near perfect condition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But I didn&#8217;t end up using the Giant on my bike tour. Instead, I rode my fathers old mountain bike instead &#8211; a Sierra Schwinn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For years my father had had this old black bicycle in the garage and I rarely ever saw him ride it. It has been just sitting their, collecting cobwebs for years and years, so I decided to fix up the old clunker and use it for my trip down the Pacific Coast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bike was a 1980&#8217;s Sierra Schwinn. I&#8217;m not exactly sure what year it is, but if you happen to know, please get in contact with me. I&#8217;d love to know what year this bike is actually from.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, to make a long story short, I fixed the old thing up, stuck a couple racks on it, and successfully pedaled the beast from Oregon to Mexico.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6074" title="schwinnlighthouse" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/05/schwinnlighthouse.jpg" alt="" width="658" height="216" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6073" title="borderpatrolbike" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2010/05/borderpatrolbike.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="307" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the last day of that trip, upon reaching the Mexican border, I loaded the bike onto the front rack of my aunt&#8217;s VW camper-van and took off back to her home in Coronado. But when my aunt sped through a large dip in a major intersection, the front wheel of my bike was pushed into the pavement, ripped off of my aunt&#8217;s van, and immediately run over! Once my aunt had made it though the intersection, she stopped the van and I jumped out, practically in tears. The bike that I had just spent the last 30 days riding down the coast had been run-over by a two-ton vehicle and parts of it were now scattered about in a large San Diego intersection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I jumped out of my aunt&#8217;s van and ran around the intersection for a few minutes, dodging cars and picking up the few pieces of my bike that I could find in the road. A day or two later, I made it back home with my twisted wreck of a bike. It wasn&#8217;t how I imagined returning home after my successful trip down the California Coastline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In college now, I started to think about how I would spend my upcoming summer. My bike trip down the California coastline had been so great that I wanted to do it again&#8230; and this time I set my sights on riding over the Rocky Mountains &#8211; from Kansas to Wyoming. Now without a bike however, and still without much funds in my bank account, I decided it would be cheaper to simply repair my old Sierra Schwinn than to buy a new bicycle. So what did I do? I hammered out the frame of the Sierra Schwinn as best as I could, bought two new wheels, installed a new rear derailleur and off I went!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the summer of 2002 I spent a month riding my Sierra Schwinn over the Rock Mountains. It squeaked and strained the entire time&#8230; and riding it made me extremely sore and uncomfortable. When I reached Rawlins, Wyoming, I knew I could go no further with the bike. It had reached it&#8217;s last leg&#8230; and so had I. I wanted to keep going, but my bike and my body were done. We had had enough. It was time to go home. So I boxed up the bike, boarded a Greyhound bus and rode for the next day or so with a tribe of Native American firefighters back to my home in Southern California.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The next year I bought a new bike for my touring exploits (a Fuji Touring Bike), but I kept the Schwinn around and have continued to ride it over the years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, the Sierra Schwinn is my main commuter bike. I use it on a near daily basis to run errands, pick up groceries, take items that need to be mailed to the post office&#8230; and sometimes I even ride it to the <a title="carrying skis on a bicycle" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/how-to-carry-skis-on-a-bicycle/">ski resort with my skis in tow</a>. I&#8217;ve fixed the bike up so many times, I now call it the &#8220;Resurrection 9000&#8221; because that&#8217;s how many times I&#8217;ve brought it back to life. The bike today is still incredibly hard to ride,  only a few of the gears work and you can&#8217;t put any pressure on the pedals when you are riding or the chain will fall off. The bike may be a piece of junk today, but it just keeps going&#8230; and I can&#8217;t stop riding it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sierra Schwinn my father gave me ten years ago may not be the best bike in the world, and even though it may not technically be the first bike I ever owned, I will forever think of it as my first bike.</p>
