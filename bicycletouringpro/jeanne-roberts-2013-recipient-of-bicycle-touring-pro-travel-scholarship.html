<h1>Jeanne Roberts &#8211; 2013 Recipient of Bicycle Touring Pro Travel Scholarship</h1>
<p>Congratulations go out to Jeanne Roberts who is this year&#8217;s recipient of the Bicycle Touring Pro Travel Scholarship!  The travel scholarship started in 2010 as a financial boost to young bicycle travelers setting out on their first big journey; this year Jeanne will be receiving $500USD in funding to go towards her cross-country USA bike tour.</p>
<p><a href="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/04/Jeanne-Roberts1.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20171" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2013/04/Jeanne-Roberts1.png" alt="Jeanne Roberts1" width="314" height="189" /></a>Every year bicycle touring gains momentum around the world and the physical and mental challenges of long-distance bicycle travel are gaining popularity among young people as well. This year we received so many exceptional applications from all over the globe &#8211; for a review of this year&#8217;s finalists check out <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/the-bicycle-touring-pro-travel-scholarship-2013-finalists/" target="_blank">http://bicycletouringpro.com/the-bicycle-touring-pro-travel-scholarship-2013-finalists/ </a></p>
<p>Jeanne Roberts was able to clearly and passionately express her plans of biking across the USA this summer.  After a nearly fatal accident last summer in which a surfing board slashed a main artery in her leg, Jeanne has been recovering and regaining mobility and is celebrating a full recovery by cycling across her country.  Supported by her boyfriend and best friend she is setting out on a journey centred on enjoying great health and life; her trip&#8217;s headline really says it all &#8220;Cruisin &#8216;USA &#8211; a celebratory ride across the United States&#8221; &#8211; you can check out her website and follow her progress too: <a href="http://cruisinusawebsite.blogspot.ca/?view=magazine" target="_blank">http://cruisinusawebsite.blogspot.ca/?view=magazine</a></p>
<p>The trip will span neary 4,000 miles, starting in Georgetown D.C. and finishing in Seaside, OR.  After gear and other one-time expenses, Jeanne is budgeting $10/day for her trip &#8211; there is plenty of free camping and <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org" target="_blank">CouchSurfing</a> planned to keep the expenses low.</p>
<p>The willingness to portray her accident, recovery process and her drive to get better has been captured in a short, creative video which Jeanne also sent in with her application.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you are looking for people who are passionate about travel (which I am (I’m only 25 and I&#8217;ve lived in five different countries and I&#8217;ve traveled to over 15 different countries)) and enthusiastic about bike touring, which I&#8217;ve got to admit, I’m totally excited yet nervous to do this summer. But, for me, this trip is mostly a personal journey. Miraculously, I have already overcome the odds, and I now I want to exceed them; I want to prove that I’m whole again. I want to inspire everyone and encourage people to overcome the obstacles that have been placed in front of them. Basically, I want to give people hope. After all, that’s what kept me going. It would be an honor to receive this scholarship.&#8221; (excerpt from Jeanne&#8217;s scholarship application)</p>
<p>As the recipient of this year&#8217;s travel scholarship, I hope that Jeanne will be able to inspire others to overcome challenges and pursue their dreams.  Not everyone is able to turn a serious accident into a catalyst for pursuing challenges and new adventures; I admire Jeanne&#8217;s drive to constantly push her own limits!</p>
<p>Also, I hope that the prestige from winning this scholarship will help Jeanne gain the press coverage that she needs to further fund her trip which includes local TV news (WHSV) and a press release with her local newspaper (DNR).  Already, we here at <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> are looking forward to following Jeanne&#8217;s journey, along with her crew and road companions; their GoPro camera and creative abilities will let us be a part of the ride too.  There&#8217;s even been mention of collaborating with musicians and song-writers during the trip&#8230; we are intrigued!</p>
<p>Sincere thanks go out to everyone involved in this year&#8217;s travel scholarship &#8211; to all the applicants, supporters, donators and everyone here at <em>Bicycle Touring Pro</em> &#8211; thank you for helping us support young bicycle travellers and their inspirational tours!</p>

<p>Congratulations Jeanne! We are looking forward to learning about your journey this summer from Georgetown D.C. to Seaside, OR.  We agree that there&#8217;s no better way to celebrate a full recovery than on a bicycle!</p>
