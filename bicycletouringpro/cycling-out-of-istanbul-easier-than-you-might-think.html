<p>To be honest, I was a little nervous about cycling out of Istanbul. I mean, the city is seriously big! The drivers are aggressive! And there are no real bicycle paths to speak of. I was sure that it would take several hours for me to exit Europe&#8217;s largest city on my bicycle.</p>
<p>The truth, however, was that it was really rather simple and it only took me one hour and twenty minutes to cycle from my rented apartment in Istanbul&#8217;s European district to the park on the eastern end of the city where the traffic essentially comes to an end.</p>
<p>I was going to take a ferry boat from Be??kta? to Sariyer for the super low price of just three Turkish Lira, but I missed the boat (twice! doh!), so I finally just jumped on my bike and started riding. To my surprise, getting out of Istanbul was not nearly as difficult as I had thought it would be and frankly, I wish I had spent more time cycling around Istanbul while I was there.</p>
