They feature a sporty, aerodynamic design &#8211; like what you might find on a professional road cycling shoe. But  Sidi mountain bikes shoes, unlike their road shoe counterparts, are designed specifically for off-road riding.</p>
<p>The fact that Sidi mountain bike shoes are designed to be ridden off road, in rocky, dirty and difficult terrain, means that the shoes feature certain characteristics not found on road shoes of a similar style and design. For example, Sidi mountain bike shoes do have the same breathable, tightly strapped down outer fabric design of their road shoe brothers and sisters, but these shoes have a larger, hiking shoe-style sole, allowing them to be worn both on and off the bicycle. If you reach a part of your off-road track where you can&#8217;t simply ride any longer, you need to have a shoe that can be worn comfortably in the dirt and rocks, without sacrificing your position on the trail. No slipping and sliding&#8230; please! But don&#8217;t worry, you won&#8217;t slip and fall in these high-quality mountain bike shoes by SIDI. These MTB shoes are designed to make you look good, pedal strong, and fast, and get you where you&#8217;re going &#8211; whether it be in the saddle and on the bike, or on your feet and up the trail.</p>

<p>What do you get when you combine the newest Sidi mountain bike shoe technology with a shoe that&#8217;s won multiple World Cups? Simple, the Drako SRS Shoes. The Drako (Latin for dragon) makes use of the new Techno 3 buckle system, a sleek, breathable design, and the new Drako SRS Carbon Soles. Altogether, Sidi has slashed 100 grams from the Dragon 3 while making the comfort and efficiency of the Drako design leaps and bounds ahead of any other mountain shoe on the market. Basically, the Drako plays by another set of rules, and accordingly, the game won&#8217;t ever be the same. While the Dragon 3 utilizes three different closure systems, the Drako is based around a single system &#8212; the new Tecno 3 buckle, yet another great innovation from Sidi.</p>
