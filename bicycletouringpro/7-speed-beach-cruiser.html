<h1>Cruise The Boulevard In Style With The Firmstrong Urban Lady 7-Speed Beach Cruiser</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.beachbikes.net/collections/womens-bikes/products/firmstrong-urban-lady-7-speed-womens-26-beach-cruiser-bike?variant=1068639641" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29889" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2016/01/Estonia-Bicycle-Touring-Pro-9170-660x440.jpg" alt="beach cruiser bicycle" width="660" height="440" /></a></p>
<p>My mom wanted to get a good looking, comfortable, multi-gear bicycle that she could use to ride around town and get some exercise. So, I went to <a href="http://www.beachbikes.net/" target="_blank">www.beachbikes.net</a> and ordered her a <a href="http://www.beachbikes.net/collections/womens-bikes/products/firmstrong-urban-lady-7-speed-womens-26-beach-cruiser-bike?variant=1068639641" target="_blank">Firmstrong Urban Lady 7-Speed Beach Cruiser</a> and had it shipped to my parents&#8217; house.</p>
<p>The bike was cheap (only $239.99 USD) and cost only $15 more for shipping.</p>
<p>Of all the beach cruisers available on the website, I picked this one because it had 7 speeds and was available in a multitude of colors (purple, pink, vanilla, red, mint green and baby blue). I chose the vanilla model because I thought it was a color that anyone would like.</p>
<p>When the bike arrived just two days after I ordered it, I was able to quickly remove the beach cruiser from its packaging and get it assembled in no time. <em>Beachbikes.net</em> sent me an email containing a link to a video that would walk me through the set up process of my new bicycle, but I&#8217;ve assembled a few bikes in my time, so I made quick work of the assembly process &#8211; putting the bike together in less than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>During the bicycle&#8217;s assembly, I was impressed with the overall quality of the bike. For only $240, the bike had some nice components &#8211; a dual spring seat, <em>Shimano</em> gearing, <em>Kenda</em> tires, a kickstand, and (of course) an inexpensive steel frame that was &#8220;Made in China.&#8221; The bike is far from top-of-the-line, but it&#8217;s the perfect vehicle for riding around town or cruising up and down on the boardwalk. After all, it is a &#8220;beach cruiser!&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as the bike was assembled, I gifted the new 7-speed beach cruiser to my mother and she couldn&#8217;t wait to take it out for a test ride in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Watch the video below to see how the bicycle is shipped to your home and needs to be assembled before you can ride it. Then, be sure to watch until the very end to see my mom riding the bicycle on our local bike path here in Southern California.</p>

<p>After a long ride across town, my mother was smiling from ear to ear. This 7-speed beach cruiser turned out to be the perfect bicycle for her needs. It&#8217;s comfortable, allows you to ride in an up-right position, it has 7 gears (which makes going up small hills a total breeze), and it&#8217;s a joy to ride.</p>
