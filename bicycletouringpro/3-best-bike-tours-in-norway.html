<h1>The 3 Best Bike Tours in Norway</h1>
<p>Norway is an incredible place for a bicycle tour of any kind. The land is beautiful, the accommodations are lush, the locals speak English, and the food is to die for. Plus, this Scanvinavian country isn&#8217;t nearly as expensive as everyone says it is &#8211; especially when you book a bike tour package with a local tour company.</p>
<p>With so many wonderful <a href="http://www.gobicycletouring.com/search-result/?s_name=&amp;s_country=norway&amp;s_difficulty=all&amp;post_date=&amp;s_price=0%3B5000&amp;s_distance=0%3B100&amp;s_tour_distance=0%3B3000&amp;s_tour_length=0%3B90&amp;submit=Search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cycling holidays in Norway</a> to choose from, I&#8217;ve decided to feature three of the country&#8217;s best self-guided bicycle tours.</p>
<h3>Biking Hardangerfjord Bike Tour</h3>
<p><a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/hardangerfjord-norway-in-a-nutshell-bike-tour/"><img class="alignnone" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2015/07/IMG_2160-660x450.jpg" alt="Biking Hardangerfjord Norway Bike Tour - best bike tours in Norway" width="660" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>This self-guided bicycle tour starts and begins just outside of Norway&#8217;s second-largest city and most popular tourist attraction &#8211; the city of Bergen. From there, you&#8217;ll take a short train ride to the start of the tour, cycle past dozens of high-mountain waterfalls, cruise past small lakes, and spin your legs along the edge of Norway&#8217;s most famous fjord &#8211; the Hardangerfjord. While on the tour, you&#8217;ll stay in high-end hotels, eat delicious breakfast/dinner buffets, and enjoy scrumptious packed lunches that you carry with you on your bicycle as you ride. <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/hardangerfjord-norway-in-a-nutshell-bike-tour/">This 6-day self-guided bike tour</a> costs approximately 8,950 NOK per person and is the tour you want to participate in if you&#8217;re interested in experiencing classic fjord Norway.</p>
<h3>Fjord Cycling Route Bike Tour</h3>
<p><a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/norway-fjord-cycling-route-bike-tour/"><img class="alignnone" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2015/08/IMG_5075-660x441.jpg" alt="Couple participating in the best bike tours in Norway" width="660" height="441" /></a></p>
<p>If you want to see Norway on a budget and are interested in seeing the more remote fjord regions around the city of Bergen, the <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/norway-fjord-cycling-route-bike-tour/">Fjord Cycling Route Bike Tour</a> with the tour company, Berg Fritid, is your best bet. This bike tour starts and ends in the tiny town of Matre, Norway (a 2-hour bus ride north from Bergen) and takes you in a 5-day loop around the Sognefjord region. During the tour you&#8217;ll have the option of mountain biking above a giant lake, cycling along the edge of Norway&#8217;s largest and deepest fjord (the Sognefjord), watching for whales and eagles and deer all around the route, and staying in some of the most charming accommodations anywhere in Norway. At only 6,660 NOK, this 6-day self-guided bike tour is a real steal.</p>
<h3>Around Sunnhordland By Boat &amp; Bike Tour</h3>
<p><a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/sunnhordland-biking-and-boating-across-the-fjords-and-islands-of-norway/"><img class="alignnone" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2015/07/IMG_3242-660x440.jpg" alt="Rosendal Norway best bike tour in Norway" width="660" height="440" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, the <a href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/sunnhordland-biking-and-boating-across-the-fjords-and-islands-of-norway/">Around Sunhordland by Boat &amp; Bike tour</a> is another self-guided bicycle tour operated by the Active-Norway tour company. This unique cycling holiday begins in the picturesque town of Rosendal and then stretches south and west to the coastal villages of Skånevik, Leirvik and Bekkjarvik. During this romantic bike tour, you&#8217;ll be spending much of your time cycling along the water&#8217;s edge as you zip along the edge of Hardangerfjord, take several small ferry boats across the water, and marvel at dozens of small, idyllic islands. As with each of the tours listed here, the accommodations are first class, the food and drinks are superb, and the tour is completely arranged for you. Just book the dates you want to travel and the tour company will do the rest for you. Your bags will even be transported for you, from one hotel to the next, so you don&#8217;t have to carry your things with you on your bicycle as you ride. This 5-day self-guided bike tour in Sunnhordland Norway costs 8,150 NOK per person and is the bike tour you should select if you love the idea of cycling across several small islands in Scandinavian Norway.</p>
<h3>The Best Bike Tours in Norway &#8211; My Conclusion</h3>
