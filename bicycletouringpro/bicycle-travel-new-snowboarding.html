<h1>Could Bicycle Travel Be The New Snowboarding?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">Years ago, snowboarding was completely unknown to most people in the world. Origionally banned from ski resorts and looked down upon by traditional skiers, snowboarders pressed on and fought hard to get their sport accepted by those within the snow industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Today, snowboarding is more popular amongst young powderhounds than skiing and the snowboard industry has carved out a niche for itself that is bigger, more profitable and has made more of an impact on youth culture than any of its original founders could ever have imagined possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The question then is this: Could such a thing ever happen in the bicycle touring world? Could young riders reinvent the sport, build a lifestyle behind bicycle travel, and turn bicycle touring into an activity that is bigger and better than any of us can currently imagine?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1455" style="border: black 1px solid;" title="snowbaording-young-riders" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2009/03/snowbaording-1.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="448" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What&#8217;s important to note is that:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><strong>1)</strong> Snowboarding was origionally done by just a few people (typically of a younger generation).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><strong>2)</strong> Traditional skiers looked down on snowboarding and frowned upon the presence of snowboards at their resorts (some resorts still restrict snowboard access).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><strong>3)</strong> The media played an important and influential role in propelling the sport of snowboarding to new heights.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A Time For Change Has Come</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">So how does all of this relate to bicycle touring? And why exactly should you care?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It relates to bicycle touring because, as both myself and countless <em>BicycleTouringPro.com</em> readers have pointed out, bicycle touring is an activity that has failed to evolve since its peak in the 1970&#8217;s. While other sports and activities have continued to grow, expand, and evolve, bicycle touring has become an activity of the past &#8211; a sport that is largely conducted by people over the age of 50.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For years I&#8217;ve been hearing those in the bicycle touring world talk about the need to bring bicycle touring to a new generation of riders.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Being a younger rider myself, I was at first inspired by the talk of newer, younger riders joining the bicycle touring revolution. But as time went on, I began to believe that the traditional bicycle touring world (while they have good intentions) are not only failing to attract new riders at an acceptable rate, but are actually repelling new riders by holding on to the traditional bicycle touring ways of the past.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now this isn&#8217;t meant as a diss against the established bicycle touring organizations, people over the age of 50, or anyone who wants to keep bicycle touring the way it is&#8230; but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I believe that bicycle touring not only deserves an update, but desperately demands one!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are at a point in history where entire industries (take the newspaper and auto industries for example) are being wiped out and asked to reinvent themselves to accommodate to the needs and demands of our ever changing world. The people, organizations, and businesses who are succeeding right now are the ones who are willing to change and adapt to their market, while those who are struggling and dying are the ones who are fighting to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While some people in the bicycle touring world seem to be fighting to maintain the ways of the past&#8230; and while bicycle touring may likely never become as big, as profitable or as popular as snowboarding has become, I don&#8217;t think there is anything wrong with reinventing what we currently do and turning the act of bicycle travel into an activity that appeals to a younger generation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Could Bicycle Touring Be The New Snowboarding?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">As many readers pointed out in my latest article on <a title="reinventing a sport" href="https://bicycletouringpro.com/how-land-rover-could-forever-change-the-way-bicyclist-tourists-are-perceived/"><em>Land Rover</em> and the need for an overhaul in the image of bicycle travelers</a>, there are many in the bicycle touring world that do not want bicycle travel to become the big, popular giant that snowboarding has become. I too will admit that if bicycle touring were ever as popular as snowboarding, it probably wouldn&#8217;t be an activity that would appeal to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That being said, I do feel that bicycle touring could use a makeover and that a little bolstering to the image of bicycle travelers could really go a long way.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In order for change to happen though, I think we&#8217;ve got to start with a little self-reflection. We current bicycle travelers have to look in the mirror, pay attention to the way we are perceived by those around us, decide for ourselves how we want to be perceived in the future, and then begin working to make this new vision for the future a reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1458" style="border: black 1px solid;" title="snowbaording-2" src="https://bikepackingpro.com/btp-photos/uploads/2009/03/snowbaording-2.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="448" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Advancing The Sport Of Bicycle Travel</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">For just a minute I want you to imagine that you desperately want to bring bicycle touring to a new generation of riders. Forgetting what everyone has done in the past, what do you think could be done in the future to:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><strong>1)</strong> Bring bicycle touring to a newer, younger generation?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><strong>2)</strong> Get traditional bicycle tourists to realize that change is a good thing and that maintaining the status quo is preventing the sport from evolving into something bigger and better?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><strong>3)</strong> And finally, get the media so excited about bicycle travel that they help to spread the word about our exciting and life-altering sport?</p>
