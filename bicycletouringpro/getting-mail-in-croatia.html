<h1>Getting Mail In Croatia</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">This morning I was awoken by a knock at my apartment door.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Hello?” I called.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The handle on the door turned and I called again. “Hello?!”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The handle creaked and the door slid open.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“What the heck!?” I thought to myself as I jumped from the bed, still in my sleeping bag.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The blond haired woman who helps out around the apartment building came into my room and behind her quickly followed the mail man. My hair was a mess, I had drool plastered to the side of my face, and I barely knew where I was. I tried to cover my face with my hands, but it wasn&#8217;t doing much good.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I felt like I was in a war movie. The mail man came rushing in, as though he were a police officer about to make an arrest and shoved a package in my face.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“You ist Dareb Elif? He asked.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Yes, I&#8217;m Darren Alff.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He shoved a paper in front of me and told me to sign.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I wriggled my hand free from my sleeping bag and jotted my name down on the paper. He handed me a bulky envelope, which contained a book sent to me from a publisher in the UK. I was expecting the package, because the envelope contained a book which I&#8217;ve been asked to read and review here on BicycleTouringPro.com.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then the postman said, “You have other box. At tourist office. You must get it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Okay?” I mumbled&#8230; and the postman and his blond haired accomplice ran from the room.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Crap” I thought. “That was embarrassing! What the heck! Did I leave the door open? Or do they have another key?”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I got out of bed after that. I was practically shaking from the incident. It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve been woken up like that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I got out of bed, took a shower, dressed and then headed out in the rain to walk one mile down to the tourist office where the man told me to pick up my other package.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By now it was just after 10 AM and it was absolutely pouring rain. The mile-long walk along the coast of the ocean meant I wasn&#8217;t just getting hit from rain falling from up above, but also from water blowing in sideways off the sea. By the time I reached the tourist office I was completely soaked. Water was dripping from every part of me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I stepped inside the office and found the woman behind the desk talking in Croatian with an old man sitting in a chair in front of her. Was he a tourist? Or was he just in there, hanging out with the woman as she pretended to do her work? Neither of them acknowledged me as I entered.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After a minute or two, I sat down in one of the nearby chairs and only then did the woman look up at me and nod her head – silently asking “What do you want?”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Hi!” I said smiling. “The mail man told me to come down here and pick up a package?”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I handed her the form the mail man had given me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She looked at it for a second and said, “This is not post office!” and handed the paper back to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She pointed outside and to the left, directing me where to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Thank you” I said.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I thought it was strange that the postman would leave a package for me in the tourist office, but this is a small town and I&#8217;ve encountered stranger things on my travels.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So I left the tourist office and walked about a hundred meters down the coast to the small, one room post office located just across from the harbor.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Inside, there were three women behind the counter, but only one of them was with a customer. The other two just sat there, talking idly back and forth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I stepped up to one of the empty counters, expecting the woman behind the glass to turn and help me, but she didn&#8217;t even budge and continued her conversation with the other woman.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I looked around to see if there was a sign telling me that this was some special line just for people needing a passport or stamps or other such thing, but there was no such sign. So I just waited until the one woman who was actually working finished with the female customer in front of me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the woman left a minute or two later, I stepped up to the counter, slipped the gal behind the glass my paperwork and didn&#8217;t say a word.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She motioned for my identification and I passed her my wet passport, which I had been carrying in my jacket pocket.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the passport met her approval, she ran into an adjacent closet and brought out a small brown box, carrying it as thought it weighed a hundred pounds, and plopped it down in front of me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Thank you” I said, as I picked up the box (which was not nearly as heavy as she made it out to be) and walked out the door, back into the rain.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By now it was dumping. Near hurricane type weather. Waves were crashing on the shore and the water was falling from the sky at a 45% angle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I ran as quickly as I could back to my apartment on the other side of town. The box was getting drenched as I ran, and by the time I arrived, the cardboard was starting to break apart and fall to the ground. But I did eventually make it&#8230; and the box remained intact!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The package was from my friend, Leslie.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Leslie had come to visit me earlier this year when I was in Switzerland and we had spent a good ten days or so traveling around the country on the train and by foot.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Inside the package, Leslie had packaged some of my favorite treats. Cliff bars, cookies, peanut butter, beans and tortillas, and even some magazines and a book.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was completely drenched, still a bit shocked after my startling morning wake up, and slightly saddened by this turn in weather, but boy was I glad to have this little taste of home.</p>
