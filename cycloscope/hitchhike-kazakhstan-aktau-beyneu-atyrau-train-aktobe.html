<title>Hitchhiking Kazakhstan&#8217;s Steppe and a Sleeping on a Train Baggage shelf</title>
<meta name="description" content="With only 15 days to cycle more than 4.000km through the desert, we have no other choice but to hitchhike. Fortunately here in the steppe of Kazakhstan, it&#8217;s as easy as taking a bus in London. Just wait for the first truck, wave your hand and it will stop if the driver has the tiniest room for you. And than the fun begins."/>

<h2>Hitchiking the Kazakhstan steppe from Aktau to Beyneu and on a Soviet-era train from Atyrau to Aktobe. A different style of bicycle touring in Kazakhstan.</h2>



<p>Having been <a href="https://cycloscope.net/things-do-baku-uzbek-visa">denied the visa for Uzbekistan</a>, we&#8217;re forced to cross around 4,000 miles of desert in 15 days. The length of our free visa in Kazakhstan. We must get to Kyrgyzstan, the only visa-free country which borders Kazakhstan.</p>



<p>Apparently there seem to be no train tickets to anywhere so we&#8217;re forced to hitchhike, let&#8217;s see how it goes.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">From Aktau to Shetpe (160km) &#8211; the Mangistau district</h2>



<p>And so we&#8217;ll be Lorry-scope for a little while. We get out of the unnoteworthy city of Aktau, a settlement in the middle of the desert, placed there by the Soviets to exploit the Caspian Sea oil, and begin hitchhiking.</p>



<p>After ten minutes, a jeep with two brothers stops by, and they speak English (they will remain almost the only English speakers we&#8217;ll ever meet in Kazakhstan). We load the bikes on the roof and we&#8217;re off.</p>



<p>They are going to the funeral of a relative, about 80 km from there. Not many, but better than nothing. They stop at the lookout point, we are in <strong>the&nbsp;great depression of Karagiye</strong>,&nbsp;about 140&nbsp;meters below&nbsp;sea level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The landscape is beautiful&nbsp;from here, there are not yet bare&nbsp;steppe, it&#8217;s hilly around the depression, but not a single tree anyway.</p>



<p>The guy is quite proud of their region, the Mangistau <em>Oblast</em> (district), where we&#8217;re now. They say it&#8217;s a pity we&#8217;re in such a rush, there are apparently a lot of interesting things to see here.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fafee751_lorry-scope-hitch-biking-kazakhstans-steppe.jpg" alt="the Karagiye depression things to do Aktau" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fafee751_lorry-scope-hitch-biking-kazakhstans-steppe.jpg" alt="the Karagiye depression things to do Aktau" title=""></noscript><figcaption>the Karagiye Depression</figcaption></figure>



<p>They&nbsp;want us to taste&nbsp;the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kazakh national drink, called <em>Chal</em> or <em>Shubat</em></a>, fermented&nbsp;camel milk. But in the&nbsp;&#8220;bar&#8221;&nbsp;where we stop&nbsp;they&nbsp;don&#8217;t have it,&nbsp;and I think,&nbsp;&#8220;luckily&#8221;&#8230; I&#8217;m afraid&nbsp;that&nbsp;my gut&nbsp;can react&nbsp;badly.</p>



<p>These&nbsp;two guys&nbsp;are fantastic, they&nbsp;buy&nbsp;water, beer,&nbsp;and&nbsp;also&nbsp;a Kazakh&nbsp;sim&nbsp;card, (very easy and cheap to get)!&nbsp;And last,&nbsp;but&nbsp;not least, they&nbsp;start&nbsp;asking&nbsp;around for somebody to carry us to <strong>Shetpe</strong>, another&nbsp;hundred kilometers.</p>



<p>Our new&nbsp;driver is&nbsp;a&nbsp;Kazakh&nbsp;trucker&nbsp;with&nbsp;blue eyes, maybe around 50 years old.&nbsp;The truck is one of those small ones for construction works, really&nbsp;shaky&nbsp;and dirty, poor bikes.</p>



<p>At about 8:30 pm we arrive in Shetpe, it&#8217;s almost&nbsp;dark,&nbsp;not&nbsp;much left to be done&nbsp;for today.&nbsp;We prepare&nbsp;for our first&nbsp;night&nbsp;in the steppes!</p>



<h2>Shetpe &#8211; Beyneu (308km)</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb1573c7_lorry-scope-hitch-biking-kazakhstans-steppe.jpg" alt="camping the Kazakh steppe" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb1573c7_lorry-scope-hitch-biking-kazakhstans-steppe.jpg" alt="camping the Kazakh steppe" title=""></noscript><figcaption>camping in the Kazakh steppe</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Upon waking, a little&nbsp;silted up,&nbsp;we reach the center&nbsp;of&nbsp;Shetpe,&nbsp;ask the station for a train to wherever but even here&nbsp;&#8220;<em>biliet&nbsp;nietu</em>&#8221; (no tickets).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two guys from yesterday told us that it is enough&nbsp;to give&nbsp;500&nbsp;tenge&nbsp;(2&nbsp;euro) to the&nbsp;cashier and&nbsp;the ticket&nbsp;would have appeared, but this girl&nbsp;did not seem&nbsp;corruptible. Better&nbsp;hitch-hiking.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s&nbsp;hot!&nbsp;We stop&nbsp;just outside of town&nbsp;in front of&nbsp;a gas station,&nbsp;not&nbsp;many&nbsp;trucks here,&nbsp;but&nbsp;this&nbsp;is the only road anyway, so&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;has to pass&nbsp;from here.&nbsp;And here comes a big&nbsp;truck&nbsp;with a trailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The driver,&nbsp;a Kazakh&nbsp;named Gary,&nbsp;just goes&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>Beyneu</strong>.&nbsp;Perfect,&nbsp;we load the&nbsp;bike&nbsp;onto the truck, there is&nbsp;space between the&nbsp;tanks he&#8217;s&nbsp;carrying&nbsp;(I think it&#8217;s&nbsp;gas).</p>



<p>The journey is endless, just 300 km but it takes all day! The first part is still interesting, with some nice sany-rock formations. The rest is steppe, steppe, and steppe.</p>



<p><strong>The road from Shetpe to Beineu is not paved&nbsp;for&nbsp;several miles</strong> (but they are building it), and so there are quite long parts of something that&#8217;s nothing more than a sandy dirt track.</p>



<p>The sky is obscured by the dust and we think that it would be very hard to breathe outside. We see several cars and trucks stuck, with smoking engines or dead suspensions.</p>



<p>In addition, our driver stops to get gasoline in a house in the middle of the steppes, who lives there has got contraband petrol (much cheaper than the already cheap official gasoline) and the refill is done &#8220;by hand&#8221;, it takes at least an hour.</p>



<p><strong>The place is quite surreal, there&#8217;s a goat head rotting on the ground, camels roaming, and an infinite nothingness as far as the eye can see</strong>.</p>



<p>We wonder how could people live here, it&#8217;s like 150km from the nearest town and there are just sand and wandering camels in between.</p>



<h2>Almost blew up: a little fire accident</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb27d389_lorry-scope-hitch-biking-kazakhstans-steppe.jpg" alt="hitchhiking kazakhstan bicycle" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb27d389_lorry-scope-hitch-biking-kazakhstans-steppe.jpg" alt="hitchhiking kazakhstan bicycle" title=""></noscript><figcaption>doing gasoline in the Kazakhstan steppe</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, we get to a parking lot for truckers a dozen kilometers from Beyneu, it&#8217;s 9 pm, we put the tent near the truck, always in the steppe of course.</p>



<p>We prepare something to eat but Daniel makes a colossal mistake with the alcohol bottle and I catch fire! Basically he adds a bit of ethyl alcohol on the fire directly from the bottle and of course, the alcohol gets back, and the bottle blows, he throws the bottle and I get fire on my leg. Luckily I extinguish it immediately.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re just&nbsp;behind a truck&nbsp;with&nbsp;tanks&nbsp;of&nbsp;highly flammable&nbsp;stuff, not bad a risk.&nbsp;The driver,&nbsp;who is sitting&nbsp;in the driving seat, asks&nbsp;what happens,&nbsp;we tell him&nbsp;everything is fine, we just saw a scorpion (poker face).</p>



<p>My leg hurts and I have some bladder. Gary calls us for tea, then, of course, comes the vodka, and also some food, something that for me is&nbsp;<em>friggione</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;is eaten with&nbsp;bread.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s going&nbsp;to&nbsp;Atirau&nbsp;but&nbsp;can&#8217;t take us&nbsp;over&nbsp;because&nbsp;his truck&nbsp;is not&nbsp;approved for more than&nbsp;two people&nbsp;and says that<strong>&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a police checkpoint in&nbsp;Beyneu</strong>. Tomorrow&nbsp;we will try to&nbsp;take the train&nbsp;or&nbsp;another&nbsp;truck.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb3dbe6b_lorry-scope-hitch-biking-kazakhstans-steppe.jpg" alt="Immagine" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb3dbe6b_lorry-scope-hitch-biking-kazakhstans-steppe.jpg" alt="Immagine" title=""></noscript><figcaption>Gari, our first truck driver</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Beyneu and an unsuccessful Kazakh registration</h2>



<p>Quiet night, on waking camels are all around,&nbsp;Gari&nbsp;us&nbsp;prepare&nbsp;tea&nbsp;and&nbsp;coffee and biscuits.</p>



<p>We greet him&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>cycle&nbsp;to&nbsp;Beyneu</strong>, which is really&nbsp;a&nbsp;city&nbsp;in&nbsp;the middle of nowhere. It&#8217;s probably some sort of soviet outpost town, built to be a stop station between the <strong>southern Caspian oil wells</strong> and the main motherland Russia, but its history could be more complicated, can&#8217;t find much about it on the web.</p>



<p><em>Mnoga djarka</em>(very hot), indeed&nbsp;more than 50°C!&nbsp;We try again&nbsp;at the train station, some sort of ritual,&nbsp;same old story of course.&nbsp;Today is Monday, so we can try to&nbsp;do the registration at the migration&nbsp;office.</p>



<p>There is a cue&nbsp;of&nbsp;Uzbeks&nbsp;waiting, after more than one hour in the cue they tell us <strong>we&nbsp;can&#8217;t&nbsp;register here</strong>,&nbsp;we have to go&nbsp;to the office in&nbsp;Atirau,&nbsp;just&nbsp;500 km away! We try to insist, we get upset, thinking it could work with post-soviet bureaucracy as it works with Italian, but no way.</p>



<p><strong>We call&nbsp;the Italian Embassy</strong>, and it&#8217;s&nbsp;immediately clear that&nbsp;people&nbsp;are paid&nbsp;to sit in a&nbsp;villa&nbsp;and&nbsp;maybe&nbsp;spend&nbsp;Sundays at the&nbsp;golf&nbsp;club.&nbsp;Really&nbsp;crap, but to&nbsp;insult someone&nbsp;in your own language&nbsp;is a great satisfaction&nbsp;after four&nbsp;months.</p>



<h2>A brief explanation about registration in Kazakhstan:</h2>



<p>Once in the country, <strong>you have five days to get to a migration bureau and get a stupid stamp</strong> on a stupid card they give you at the border.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t, you get fined an unspecified amount of money (maybe up to the officer there), we saw people fined <strong>100$ for each day</strong> late.</p>



<p>Since we arrived around 11:45 pm on Friday we lost one entire day for 15 minutes (lucky guys) and then Saturday and Sunday the office where closed&#8230; so we have to run, tomorrow is the last day to register!</p>



<h2>Beyneu &#8211; Atyrau (437km)</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb60a92b_lorry-scope-hitch-biking-kazakhstans-steppe.jpg" alt="bicycle touring Kazakh steppe Aktau Benyeu Atyrau" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb60a92b_lorry-scope-hitch-biking-kazakhstans-steppe.jpg" alt="bicycle touring Kazakh steppe Aktau Benyeu Atyrau" title=""></noscript><figcaption>The empty nothingness of Kazakhstan steppe</figcaption></figure>



<p>Immediately after the city, we stop thumbs out and, as always, after less than five minutes we get on a truck.</p>



<p>The driver&nbsp;is&nbsp;Turkish&nbsp;but lives in&nbsp;Bishkek,&nbsp;where he bought&nbsp;the truck. He&#8217;s going&nbsp;to&nbsp;Uralsk&nbsp;and the truck&nbsp;is empty, perfect!</p>



<p>His name is Methin and he smokes like a real Turkish, one cigarette after another. We communicate speaking five languages together, he knows a few words in a lot of languages and mixes them all.</p>



<p>But we communicate, and we can even talk about politics. Luckily, because this stretch has the most boring landscape we&#8217;ve ever seen so far!</p>



<p>We stop at&nbsp;80 kilometers from&nbsp;Atyrau,&nbsp;we take a&nbsp;bath&nbsp;in&nbsp;a dusty parking lot for truckers. There&#8217;s a bath where water is warmed with live fire from the guy outside, old style.</p>



<p>We try to pay the bath for Methin but he gets really upset, <strong>never try to pull out your wallet in front of a truck driver</strong>!</p>



<p>We sleep&nbsp;in the truck, not&nbsp;so&nbsp;comfortable, very hot, we regret not using the tent tonight.&nbsp;Methin&nbsp;will take us&nbsp;to&nbsp;Atyrau tomorrow,&nbsp;and&nbsp;wait for us&nbsp;as we go&nbsp;to&nbsp;do this damned registration,&nbsp;so we can&nbsp;continue&nbsp;with him&nbsp;until&nbsp;Uralk.&nbsp;We love truck drivers.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left paragraph">Kazakh registration in Atyrau and losing Methin</h2>



<p>We arrive in Atyrau around 11 AM. It&#8217;s again another oil factory town, with the biggest oil field discovered in the last 40 years just nearby, and with actors from all over the world came here to exploit this resources, with the Italian Eni in the front line (if you want to know more we recommend this article: <a href="http://www.mo.be/en/article/giant-oil-field-kazakhstan-ticking-time-bomb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant oil field in Kazakhstan it&#8217;s a tickin time bomb</a>).</p>



<p>We stop in a parking lot, leave all the stuff on the truck and take a cab, looking for the migration bureau, no one knows where it is. On the third attempt, we find it, fortunately, the driver is Chechen, and perhaps for this reason he knows where to go.</p>



<p>Outside the building, there is no sign, not even a flag. So here are the coordinates of this elusive office, if they didn&#8217;t change location in the meanwhile.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Atyrau Migration Bureau coordinates:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>N 47 06&#8217;15.9&#8243; E 051 55&#8217;34.9&#8243;</strong></p>



<p>There we meet&nbsp;four Romanian&nbsp;motorcyclists,&nbsp;they&nbsp;also had&nbsp;their problems&nbsp;with registration&nbsp;and&nbsp;are&nbsp;two days late. They had to&nbsp;pay a hundred&nbsp;dollars each for&nbsp;fine&nbsp;and&nbsp;have been waiting&nbsp;since yesterday&nbsp;for the registration.</p>



<p>Moreover, the office closes for lunch, and it&#8217;s not clear when they&#8217;ll re-open.</p>



<p>We jump on a taxi back to the truck, take bikes and stuff, and greet our wonderful driver. We don&#8217;t know how long we must wait for the stamp, so we cannot let Methin sit there and wait all day.</p>



<p>Back&nbsp;to the office,&nbsp;we&nbsp;wait for&nbsp;the reopening&nbsp;after the lunch break. At 3 PM we get our&nbsp;stupid&nbsp;stamp!</p>



<h2>Atyrau &#8211; Aktobe by train (about 550km)</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb7e08c4_lorry-scope-hitch-biking-kazakhstans-steppe.jpg" alt="Kazakhstan Atyrau Aktobe train" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb7e08c4_lorry-scope-hitch-biking-kazakhstans-steppe.jpg" alt="Kazakhstan Atyrau Aktobe train" title=""></noscript><figcaption>our &#8220;cabin&#8221; on the Atyrau &#8211; Aktobe train</figcaption></figure>



<p>Stuck in a sort of repetitive ritual, we try&nbsp;the train station&nbsp;again, no tickets of course. But this time&nbsp;Daniele&nbsp;goes&nbsp;straight to&nbsp;the conductor on the platform and starts arguing.</p>



<p>At the end, we can board the train, but we<strong> have to pay a bribe which is two times the price of the ticket</strong>, and after long bargaining (it started with ten times the price).</p>



<p>Loading the bike is a massive undertaking. Mine is stuck in a closet and Daniele&#8217;s is over our heads, in a one square meter local with a sink and a lot of buttons.</p>



<p>This will be our cabin for a while, but they promise a place to sleep and shower as well, later. Outside the window only steppe and steppe and steppe. Seem endless.</p>



<p>We end up sleeping (trying to) on top of the beds, on the baggage shelf, less than 1.5 meters long, and with no more than 40cm of air from the roof.</p>



<p>Very comfortable! And they seem to have forgotten about the shower. But at least in the morning, we&#8217;re in Aktobe.</p>



<p>We get off the train one station&nbsp;before&nbsp;Aktobe&nbsp;(because&nbsp;there&nbsp;we&nbsp;may&nbsp;be asked&nbsp;a ticket we don&#8217;t have) at 8 AM,&nbsp;we ride&nbsp;to the city station,&nbsp;but no tickets again and the bike fee remains an&nbsp;enigma.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t want to bargain with another conductor and sleep another night on the baggage shelf, so we go look for a truck.</p>
