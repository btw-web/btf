<h2 class="has-text-align-center">A road trip itinerary of Panay Island<br>Iloilo, Antique, Malalison Island, Caticlan and more things to do</h2>



<p>Panay is mainly known as the gate to Boracay island, the most famous tourist destination in the Philippines and one of the most visited in South East Asia.</p>



<p>But to our eyes, most famous and most visited usually means most crowded and expansive. So, since we are more the &#8220;off the beaten path&#8221; kind of travelers we decided to explore Panay instead, and here is our itinerary.</p>



<p>Panay is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sixth-largest island in the Philippines</a>, inhabited by around 4 million people, is located in the Western Visayas province. Our tour started in the busy capital Iloilo, coming by RoRo ferry from <strong><a href="https://cycloscope.net/guimaras-itinerary-cycling-philippines" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guimaras</a></strong>, to end in the North-Western tip of the island in <strong>Caticlan</strong>, around 300km in seven days.</p>



<p>Ours was a bicycle touring trip, but the information listed below should be valuable for everyone who wishes to visit this beautiful island.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><a href="https://cycloscope.net/a-rough-guide-to-adventure-travel-philippines-on-a-budget-by-bicycle-or-not" rel="noopener noreferrer">This article is part of our guide to adventure travel to the Philippines on a budget.</a><br></strong><strong><a href="https://cycloscope.net/visayas-philippines-best-islands-itineraries-bicycle-touring">Check here our 4 itineraries for 4 incredible islands in the Visayas</a></strong></p>



<h2>Panay Island Suggested Itinerary Breakdown</h2>



<p>Since we were cycling this itinerary took us 7 relaxing days to be completed. If you&#8217;re traveling by any other means of transportation you can have a good experience of Panay Islands in just 5 days.</p>



<ul><li>1 Night in Iloilo, visiting the Churches and local markets</li><li>1 Night in Nogas Island, visiting Miagao on the way</li><li>3 Nights in Antique, visiting Malalison and Batbatan, hiking the BatungBatu falls</li></ul>



<h3>The bicycle route</h3>



<p>Down below is the <strong>detailed map of our itinerary in Panay Island</strong>, with elevation profile. It&#8217;s the GPX track recorded by our GPS during the whole journey.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left wsite-content-title">Iloilo City</h2>



<p><a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Iloilo_(city)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Iloilo</strong></a> is a not so pleasant and chaotic 400.000 people city, with a good range of cheap but ugly accommodation and some &#8220;resorts&#8221; along the coast heading west. The sea here is quite dirty and not inviting, we suggest to just pass through.</p>



<p>If you have one night to spend in Iloilo you can visit the local markets, and have a look at some of the colonial heritage left by the Spanish colonist here, like the&nbsp;<strong>Jaro Cathedral, Lizares Mansion, Casa Mariquit, Molo Church, and Bahay Camiña Nga Bato.</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left wsite-content-title">Panay south coast and Miagao</h2>



<p>Proceeding east the situation doesn&#8217;t improve so much, the road is a little busy with not <strong>a lot</strong> to see but plenty of <strong>fighting-cocks breeding farms</strong> and the usual arena for the fights.</p>



<p>About 40km east of Iloilo is the town of <strong>Miagao</strong> which is beautiful and very interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miagao_Church" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sto. Tomas de Villanueva Parish Church</em></a>, also known as the <strong>Fortress Church</strong>,&nbsp;designed to have thick walls to serve as protection from invaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The façade of Miagao church is very unique, ornately decorated bas-relief featuring a coconut tree depicted as the&nbsp;<i>tree of life,</i> St. Christopher dressed in local traditional clothing carrying the Child Jesus on his back, the daily life of Panay people, native flora and fauna &#8211; all this in the middle of two huge watchtower belfries on each side.</p>



<p>Riding this road it&#8217;s easy to notice that Panay looks more wealthy then the average of the Philippines, the houses are mostly brick and concrete and you will see some big villas.</p>



<h2>The Southwest and Nogas Island</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/p1280021-01_orig.jpeg" alt="Sto.

Tomas de Villanueva Parish Church Fortress Church. Miagao, Panay" title=""></noscript><figcaption>Sto. Tomas de Villanueva Parish Church, also known as the Fortress Church. In Miagao, Panay.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some 15km further there&#8217;s the town of St. Joaquin, the road here is a constant up and down, Past St. Joaquim you have the option to cut through the PC Barracks Road, but we advise to stick to the coast.</p>



<p>The scenery in this small peninsula is among the best on Panay&#8217;s coast, up and down through lush green forest with great views of the half-rocky/half-sandy shore. There is accommodation here but mostly overpriced. There is also a hot spring resort if you really want to get boiled.</p>



<p>Just off the coast the beautiful <strong><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g3602078-d7123184-Reviews-Nogas_Island-Anini_y_Antique_Province_Panay_Island_Visayas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">island of </a></strong><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g3602078-d7123184-Reviews-Nogas_Island-Anini_y_Antique_Province_Panay_Island_Visayas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Nogas</strong></a>, an underrated and unspoiled small islet reach in corals andwith beautiful white sand beaches.</p>



<h2>Panay west coast &#8211; Antique and Malalison Island</h2>



<p>Back on the main road, you will reach the municipality of Saint Jose de Buenavista, the capital of the <strong>Antique province</strong>. Some nice beach around here but nothing spectacular. Then 70 more kilometers to reach Tibiao.</p>



<p>In Tibiao we advise looking for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kasarayainn/?pnref=lhc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasa Raja Inn and AdvenTours,</a> a guest house owned by the super-nice Alex, an artist and an interesting person to talk with.</p>



<p>He can organize trips to the nearby beautiful islands, we went with him to <strong>Malalison island</strong>, just off the coast from Tibiao, the beach has nothing to envy to <a href="https://cycloscope.net/things-to-know-boracay" title="Things to know before going to Boracay">Boracay</a> (besides the nightlife, if that&#8217;s your thing), white coral sand and crystal clear water, with the advantage (at least for our tastes) to be the only tourist on the island.</p>



<p>There is a fishermen village with a basic homestay if you want to spend the night there. Just a few hours a day of electricity, perfect for a real break.</p>



<p>A short (30 minutes) but very scenic hike brings you up the small hills to the west side of the island, where a colorful pebble beach, a tiny islet, and a very small (two houses) fisherman community will enhance the sensation of magic.</p>



<p>There are two more islands in Antique province, the&nbsp;infamous but stunning <strong>Batbatan</strong>, and the remote <strong>Maniguin. </strong>Batbatan is known for its population kin to piracy acts, but you will be safe if going on a tour.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left paragraph">Hiking in Tibiao, Antique &#8211; Batung Batu Falls</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/p1280224-01_orig.jpeg" alt="hike Panay island itinerary" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/p1280224-01_orig.jpeg" alt="hike Panay island itinerary" title=""></noscript><figcaption>The hike through rice terraces to Bugtung Batu Falls</figcaption></figure>



<p>The same day we went also to the <strong>Bugtung Batu Falls</strong>, a series of seven waterfalls close to the <em>barangay</em> of Tuno (A <em>barangay</em>, often abbreviated to “Brgy.”, is the smallest administrative division in the Philippines, sort of a village) around 15km from Tibiao, along the Tibiao River. They might not be as popular as <a href="https://www.lavidaviva.com/Kawasan-Falls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Kawasan Falls</a> but they are not less stunning.</p>



<p>In Tuno you will pay a small fee of 100P and&nbsp;be asked to hire a local guide, not really needed but it&#8217;s cheap and the guides are people of the village, so you will support the local community.</p>



<p>Of the seven waterfalls, you can visit only three but those are beautiful and have nice natural pools to bathe in.</p>



<p>To get to the third waterfall you must climb a rope on a slippery rocky surface, adventurous but really worth it. The hike itself is a short but beautiful walk through lush rice terraces.</p>



<p>Going further is apparently impossible on a day trip, you must set an overnight expedition, again Alex from Kasa Raja can help you with that.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left paragraph">More things to do in Panay</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/p1280209-01_orig.jpeg" alt="tourist spots Panay waterfall" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/p1280209-01_orig.jpeg" alt="tourist spots Panay waterfall" title=""></noscript><figcaption>Climbing the rope to reach the 3rd of the Bagtung Batu falls</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some more attraction in this area are:</p>



<ul><li>the <strong><em>Kawa</em> hot baths.</strong> Huge pans where water and leaves are put, then the water is heated by a wood fire and you can bath in like you are being cooked by some cannibals.</li><li>Kayaking down the Tibiao River. That cannot be done during the dry season</li><li>the 1km long (two ways) <em>zip line</em>. For 300P you can fly, harnessed to a cable, over the river, and the rice terraces.</li></ul>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Bicycle touring Panay northwest</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dsc07864-01_orig.jpeg" alt="adventure itinerary panay island" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dsc07864-01_orig.jpeg" alt="adventure itinerary panay island" title=""></noscript><figcaption>The 1km long zipline in Tibiao</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The remaining 93km is<span style="font-size: 16px;"> just nice until you hit the </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Panay_Peninsula_Natural_Park" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, apparently a special permit is needed to visit the park but just riding along it offers some of the best views on the island. Going towards Caticlan there&#8217;s one</span>&nbsp;last<span style="font-size: 16px;"> climb, also with great views, and some very nice beaches along the road.</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">In <strong>Caticlan</strong> there is a wide range of accommodation and the big harbor, from where you could reach many destinations, yes, even Boracay&#8230; but once you&#8217;ll be there and see the crowd of families and groups all going there&#8230; maybe you will reconsider.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Our plan was to go from here to Mindoro, but the island was still under a strong typhoon, so we took a 12h RoRo ferry to <a href="https://cycloscope.net/things-to-consider-for-your-manila-bike-tour" title="Things to Consider for Your Manila Bike Tour">Manila</a>, very funny, especially when all the crew began to dance(?). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADNgEHFDYzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It&#8217;s more fun in the Philippines</a>.</p>
