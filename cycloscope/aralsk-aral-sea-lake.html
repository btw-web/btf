<h2>What used to be the major port on the Aral Lake is now a creepy town in the middle of a deadly desert. We had to hitchhike our way here. Our road trip</h2>



<p>We keep on rushing our way through the steppe of Kazakhstan. Due to the <a href="https://cycloscope.net/things-do-baku-uzbek-visa">Uzbek visa denied by the drunk consul in Azerbaijan</a>, <strong>our bicycle trip in Central Asia recently <a href="https://cycloscope.net/hitchhike-kazakhstan-aktau-beyneu-atyrau-train-aktobe"> became a hitchhiking race</a>. </strong>The <a href="https://cycloscope.net/caspian-ferry-baku-aktau-kazakhstan-azerbaijan">ferry from Azerbaijan</a> dropped us in the middle of nowhere, in the city of Aktau, and from there we only have 15 days to reach Kyrgyzstan.<br>We had great plans about <a href="https://cycloscope.net/category/regions/central_asia/kazakhstan"><strong>bicycle touring in Kazakhstan</strong></a>, before we started this bicycle trip. But now everything is upside down and we have to cope with it.</p>



<p>At least though, we want to visit the town of <strong>Aralsk, once the biggest port on the shores of the Aral Lake</strong> (or Aral Sea).<br>If you don&#8217;t know the actual<a href="https://cycloscope.net/farewell-aral-sea"> disaster occurring since at least 5 decades in the area of Aralsk, read this short article we wrote about this</a>.</p>



<h2>Getting to Aralask</h2>



<p>52 Celsius. We&#8217;re in Aktobe, the nicest of the Kazakh cities we saw so far. Some colorful wooden houses and even some trees along the roads. Just there anyway, outside the landscape is just the same: bare, yellowish, dry steppe.</p>



<p>We get out of the city and put our thumbs out. As usual,&nbsp;almost immediately&nbsp;we find&nbsp;a lift,<strong> hitchhiking in Kazakhstan is like taking the bus now</strong>.</p>



<p>A Russian-Kazakh&nbsp;guy&nbsp;who is going right to&nbsp;Aralsk&nbsp;(did you notice all the cities in Kazakhstan begin with&nbsp;A?).</p>



<p>We stop for lunch&nbsp;and he, as usual, pays for us,&nbsp;then starts to&nbsp;make phone calls&nbsp;and we understand he speaks about us.&nbsp;We grab from his Russian that he will take us&nbsp;to sleep&nbsp;in&nbsp;some&nbsp;motel, okay,&nbsp;if&nbsp;it doesn&#8217;t cost an eye a&nbsp;shower&nbsp;would not be&nbsp;too&nbsp;bad.<br>When it&#8217;s dark, we arrive&nbsp;at a place he doesn&#8217;t seem to know either,&nbsp;someone on the phone&nbsp;must have told him&nbsp;to go there.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a prefab&nbsp;with some rooms, it&#8217;s <strong>the sleeping quarter for workers</strong> building&nbsp;the road.</p>



<h3>Dining and drinking with the local workers, next to the Aral Sea</h3>



<p>They welcome us and&nbsp;lead in&nbsp;a room&nbsp;with a double bed. We ask&nbsp;how much it costs, but they seem&nbsp;offended and&nbsp;tell us they do not want&nbsp;anything!&nbsp;Long live&nbsp;the Kazakhs!&nbsp;We are told that&nbsp;there is a shower but there&#8217;s no light, so tomorrow&nbsp;morning.</p>



<p>They lead us to&nbsp;another room,&nbsp;where <strong>they have prepared&nbsp;the&nbsp;dinner</strong>. The driver&nbsp;must have told them I&#8217;m a vegetarian, because&nbsp;they knew it&nbsp;and get a lot of&nbsp;hard-boiled eggs!&nbsp;All, of course, accompanied by&nbsp;vodka, liters of vodka. These truck drivers, they don&#8217;t drink a single sip of beer when they&#8217;re working, but <strong>once the truck is parked for the night the party always begins</strong>. We go to sleep&nbsp;happy, and completely drunk. Sometimes&nbsp;humanity is not&nbsp;so bad!&nbsp;At least&nbsp;the humanity of the&nbsp;truckers&#8230;</p>



<h2>Aralsk: what&#8217;s left of the biggest port on the Aral Lake</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb2f0527_aralsk-whats-left-of-a-sea.jpg" alt="Aral sea from Arask" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb2f0527_aralsk-whats-left-of-a-sea.jpg" alt="Aral sea from Arask" title=""></noscript><figcaption>this was the Aral Sea</figcaption></figure>



<p>We wake up late, huge hangover, we should learn how to say no to the 20th glass of vodka&#8230; <span id="result_box" class="" lang="en" tabindex="-1"><span class="">We&#8217;re just 15km from Aralsk, so we ride our bicycles into town.</span></span></p>



<p><strong>Aralsk</strong>, which until recently was the most important port city on the Kazakh side of Lake Aral, now is a gloomy and sad settlement in the desert. <a href="https://cycloscope.net/farewell-aral-sea">What remains of the lake</a> is now more than 70km far from the city, from which is separated by a roadless expanse of sand.</p>



<h2>Why Aral sea dried out</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In the 1940s, the Soviet government decided to divert Aral Sea’s main tributary rivers, <strong>Amu Darya </strong>and <strong>Syr Darya,</strong> in order to irrigate the desert region surrounding it, in an attempt to grow rice, cereals and cotton.</p><p>Many of the canals were poorly built, allowing water to leak or evaporate. From the&nbsp;<a title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qaraqum_Canal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Qaraqum Canal</strong></a>, the largest in Central Asia, perhaps 30 to 75% of the water went to waste. Today, only 12% of Uzbekistan’s irrigation canal length is waterproofed (Wikipedia)</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>By 1960, between 20 and 60 cubic kilometres of water were going each year to the land instead that into the Aral. With most of its water supply gone, the Aral Sea began to shrink.</p><p>From 1961 to 1970, the Aral’s sea level fell at an average of 20 cm a year; in the 1970s, the average rate nearly tripled to 50–60 centimetres per year, and by the 1980s it continued to drop, now with a mean of 80–90 centimetres each year.</p><p><strong>By 2007, the Aral </strong>sea<strong> had declined to 10% of its original size.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h3>The port of Aralsk and the shipwrecks</h3>



<p>In front of the entrance of the old harbor, <strong>Nazarbayev&#8217;s photo</strong> (the president/dictator of Kazakhstan)<strong> with a huge fish in his arms</strong>. Promoting a p<span class="">roject of &#8220;reconstruction&#8221; of Lake Aral, should we trust that something will happen.</span> Besides, there is not much to see in the city. Many houses look abandoned, how to blame the poeple for leaving <strong>one of the cities with the highest throat cancer rates in the world</strong>? Indeed the toxic waste, dumped into the sea when it was still here, now became dust and fly freely with the steppe winds.</p>



<p>None of the countless associations allegedly dealing with the lake&#8217;s issue answered us, so we do not have a way to know much more. It&#8217;s really a shame. We can&#8217;t make it to the new shore of the Aral Sea, now in the middle of desertic steppe, impossible to reach by bicycle. <strong>To reach the actual shores, you must hire a 4-wheel-drive, </strong>porbably<strong> booking it in advance. We saw that the prices are not cheaper than 300USD per person</strong>.</p>



<p>So we go to see the port of Aralsk. The structures are still there, big cranes and <strong>shipwrecks</strong>. There&#8217;s a shallow pond on the south side, and a wall on the north one, that impede the access to the abandoned buildings. Here above is our video about this experience.</p>



<h2>Travelling the Silk Road on a carovan</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb482120_aralsk-whats-left-of-a-sea.jpg" alt="Aralsk bicycle touring" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58fd9fb482120_aralsk-whats-left-of-a-sea.jpg" alt="Aralsk bicycle touring" title=""></noscript><figcaption>cycling in the sad city of Aralsk</figcaption></figure>



<p>Around 6pm&nbsp;we are&nbsp;hitch-hiking again&nbsp;and at 6:01&nbsp;(seriously)&nbsp;three&nbsp;trucks stop&nbsp;at the same time,&nbsp;they are together.<br>They are&nbsp;Russians going&nbsp;to&nbsp;Uzbeksitan (long journey),&nbsp;the&nbsp;trucks are huge,&nbsp;inside there&nbsp;are&nbsp;two double beds.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re&nbsp;in two&nbsp;different trucks,&nbsp;I&#8217;m in the one&nbsp;in&nbsp;front&nbsp;and Daniele&nbsp;in&nbsp;the middle one.&nbsp;With me&nbsp;the&nbsp;caravan leader,&nbsp;and&nbsp;his son (10 years old),&nbsp;who spends his&nbsp;holidays with&nbsp;his dad.&nbsp;They tell me to&nbsp;sleep&nbsp;and&nbsp;I sleep, nothing to see, they say. Just <em>pustenjie</em> (desert).&nbsp;Maybe they&nbsp;can&nbsp;bring us up to&nbsp;<a href="https://cycloscope.net/turkestan-silk-road-kazakhstan-bicycle-touring"><strong>Turkestan</strong></a>, but they speak&nbsp;very fast&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;so it is not&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;understand.</p>



<p>At some point,&nbsp;we stop&nbsp;for a swim&nbsp;in&nbsp;a pond&nbsp;that looks like a&nbsp;mirage, it&#8217;s the first clear water since we are in Kazakhstan.&nbsp;We have a lot of fun trowing water at each other and we all get&nbsp;back to&nbsp;the&nbsp;truck&nbsp;completely wet.&nbsp;We stop&nbsp;in a parking lot&nbsp;for truckers&nbsp;and get&nbsp;dinner,&nbsp;of course payed, of course&nbsp;fried eggs, apparently&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;national dishes.&nbsp;Today is the birthday&nbsp;of my&nbsp;driver, a&nbsp;vodka&nbsp;and&nbsp;all to bed, of course&nbsp;on the truck.</p>



<p>Next morning, the caravan set off again after breakfast,&nbsp;fried eggs&#8230; the&nbsp;police stops them several times but the procedure is simple, the driver&nbsp;drops, jumps in&nbsp;the&nbsp;cop&#8217;s car, gives 2500&nbsp;tenge&nbsp;and thats fine. <strong>Bribes seem to be the norm in Kazakhstan</strong>. We were&nbsp;stopped three times&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;day, quite an expensive trip for them. We get the last dinner togheter 100 kilometers&nbsp;from&nbsp;Turkestan, then they turn&nbsp;on a road that&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t exist, through the steppes, an unpaved track to Uzbekistan.&nbsp;We greet and&nbsp;we pitch the tent&nbsp;in the nearby&nbsp;desert.</p>
