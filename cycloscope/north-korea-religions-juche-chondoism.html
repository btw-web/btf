<h2>Religions of North Korea: Shamanism, Christianity, Juche, Chondoism, and Buddhism in the most isolated country of the World</h2>



<p>With the exception of war or <strong>pandemic times</strong>, most countries in the World are somehow open to foreigners. </p>



<p>One famous exception is the Democratic Republic of Korea (DPRK), so secluded that many prefer riding their fantasies over <strong>learning something about it</strong>. </p>



<p>Getting a clue on the country is indeed <strong>no easy task</strong>.</p>



<p>When it comes to religion, we face the fact that North Korea gives <strong>no official data on it</strong>, so all info is based on estimates.</p>



<p>North Korean Constitution states that citizens enjoy <strong>freedom of religion</strong>, as well as &#8220;freedom to oppose religion&#8221;.</p>



<p>In fact, there is evidence of past and present <strong>religious persecutions</strong> and most people are atheists, but the religious palette is surprisingly colorful. </p>



<p>At this point, a reminder is needed: Korea <strong>was a unified country</strong> since the late 14th Century to 1948.</p>



<p>This means Koreans enjoyed a standardized language, homogeneous culture and <strong>similar religious beliefs</strong> for centuries.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the division between a Communist North and a Capitalist South brought <strong>very rapid historical upheavals</strong>.</p>



<p>Two facts will give you an idea about<strong> how fast were such changes</strong>: </p>



<p>1. Before 1940s, around 25–30% of Pyongyang population was Christian, earning it the nickname &#8220;<strong>Jerusalem of the East</strong>&#8220;.</p>



<p>2. Even Kim Il Sung&#8217;s mother (✝&nbsp;1932) was a <strong>Presbyterian deaconess</strong> and his father was a devout Christian too.</p>

<h2>SHAMANISM: Ancient Way of the Spirits</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://illuminatipropaganda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/shamanism-1024x685.jpg" alt="Shamanism North Korea" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load wp-image-1101" title=""><noscript><img src="https://illuminatipropaganda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/shamanism-1024x685.jpg" alt="Shamanism North Korea" class="wp-image-1101" title=""></noscript><figcaption>Masks are an important feature of Korean Shamanic Rituals</figcaption></figure>



<p>Korean Shamanism(신교, 神教) is based on the belief in Gods, Ancestors and Spirits and the <strong>power of the Shamans</strong> to communicate with them.</p>



<p>It has been around since prehistory and despite being persecuted for centuries, it&#8217;s <strong>still alive in the country</strong>.</p>



<p>Some estimates even consider Shamanism the single <strong>most popular religion in North Korea</strong>.</p>



<p>However, Shamanism has no centralized structure or formal membership, so it is <strong>almost impossible to confirm</strong> this.</p>



<p>Yet we do know that most North Korean shamans are <em>kangshinmu</em> (not hereditary) and that <strong>many fled to the South</strong> to avoid persecution.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/02/north-korea-is-religion-allowed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some affirm</a> that shamanism in North Korea is <strong>ineradicable</strong> and that  people (including <strong>top elites</strong>) consult Shamans before making important decisions.</p>



<p>Shamanism is <strong>not even mentioned</strong> in the official page of DPR Korea, so I guess the only way to get more info is to go there and get it yourself.</p>

<h2>CHONDOISM: A Religion Made Party</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://illuminatipropaganda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Statue_of_Choi_Su-un-1024x768.jpg" alt="Religions North Korea Chondoism" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load wp-image-1169" title=""><noscript><img src="https://illuminatipropaganda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Statue_of_Choi_Su-un-1024x768.jpg" alt="Religions North Korea Chondoism" class="wp-image-1169" title=""></noscript><figcaption>Statue of Choe Je-u, Image by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Cheondoism#/media/File:Statue_of_Choi_Su-un.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElleDeeEsse</a> &#8211; CC BY-SA 4.0</figcaption></figure>



<p>Chondoism (천도교, 天道教) is a quintessentially Korean religion with roots in Shamanism and Confucianism. </p>



<p>Donghak (&#8220;Eastern Learning&#8221;), the seminal <strong>anti-Western peasant movement</strong> of late 19th Century, was its cradle.</p>



<p>It all begun in May 1860, when the religious leader Choe Je-u met God and <strong>received the mystical talisman</strong> <em>Yeongju.</em></p>



<p>His successor Son Byong-hi made his teachings it into a religion proper, with the name <em>Chondogyo</em>, <strong>School of the Way of Heaven</strong>.</p>



<p>Its idea of God, called <em>Haneullim</em>, is the same as Korean Shamanism, but integrated with the Confucian self-cultivation of the <strong>Heaven within your mind</strong>. </p>



<p>In 1946, the political Party based on this religion was founded and it became one of the three parties to<strong> join the Popular Front</strong>. </p>



<p>This participation, along with its peasant origin and its proto anti-imperialist stances is why <strong>the atheist North has an eye for it</strong>.</p>



<p>And this is why, after the division, most northern Chondoists choose to stay home and <strong>didn&#8217;t flee to the South</strong>.</p>



<p>14% of DPR Koreans are religious Chondoists and Chondoist Party is the <strong>third in the country</strong>, with 22 Assembly seats.</p>

<h2>CHRISTIANITY: Ups and Downs of a Foreign Cult</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://illuminatipropaganda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chilgol_Church_15545529301-1024x575.jpg" alt="Christianity in North Korea" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load wp-image-1103" title=""><noscript><img src="https://illuminatipropaganda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chilgol_Church_15545529301-1024x575.jpg" alt="Christianity in North Korea" class="wp-image-1103" title=""></noscript><figcaption>Chilgol Church, dedicated to Kim Il Sung&#8217;s mother, Image by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chilgol_Church_(15545529301).jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uri Tours</a> &#8211; CC 2.0</figcaption></figure>



<p>The teachings of Jesus reached Korea in the 18th Century and, since then, were <strong>met with mixed reactions</strong>.</p>



<p>Yet despite its detractors, Christianity seized an active role in society and became <strong>especially popular in the North</strong>, where Confucianism was weaker.</p>



<p>In early 20th Century, many new churches popped up in Pyongyang and dozens of <strong>american Presbyterian missionaries</strong> thrived in the city.</p>



<p>Later on, Christians promoted Korean Independence from Japan, but after the division they were <strong>identified with the USA and persecuted</strong>.</p>



<p>Most of them fled to the South, contributing to make Christianity <strong>the biggest religion over there</strong>.</p>



<p>The ones who survived and stayed north of the 38th parallel are now represented by the <strong>Korean Christian Federation</strong>, a State Body.</p>



<p>This institution is known to promote meetings between northern and southern Christians in order to foster <strong>Pyongyang&#8217;s reunification agenda</strong>.</p>



<p>Since the 1980s on, the government opened up a bit, but the <strong>heydays of Jerusalem of the Est are gone</strong>: only 1.7% of DPRK citizens are Christians. </p>

<h2>BUDDHISM: Minor Religion with a Glorious Past</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://illuminatipropaganda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10390584455_b38de80857_k-1024x680.jpg" alt="Buddhism in North Korea" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load wp-image-1104" title=""><noscript><img src="https://illuminatipropaganda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10390584455_b38de80857_k-1024x680.jpg" alt="Buddhism in North Korea" class="wp-image-1104" title=""></noscript><figcaption>Buddhist monks in Pohyun Temple, Image by <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pohyun_Temple_Myohyang_Mountain_-_North_Korea_(10390584455).jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uri Tours</a> &#8211; CC 2.0</figcaption></figure>



<p>Buddhism has a very, very, very long History in Korea, but the number of its followers is<strong> surprisingly low</strong>.  </p>



<p>In DPRK it&#8217;s 4.5% of the population and only 60 temples, many of wich are kept <strong>more as museums</strong> than places of worship.</p>



<p>Buddhism in North Korea is regulated by <strong>Korea Buddhist Federation</strong> (KBF), a state organ also responsible for monks&#8217; wages.</p>



<p>To become a Buddhist monk in DPR Korea, you have to study for 8 years at <strong>Kim Il Sung University&#8217;s</strong> <strong>Religious Department</strong>.</p>



<p>After years of persecution, the government is now known to give some support, like <strong>publishing ancient books</strong> and restoring temples (Singyesa). </p>



<p>In conclusion, it is not as despised as Christianity, because (through KBF) it supported the establishment of DPRKorea, and is <strong>seen as traditional Korean culture</strong>.</p>

<h2>JUCHE: Civic Religion or something more?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://illuminatipropaganda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Juche-1024x681.jpg" alt="Juche Religion North Korea" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load wp-image-1105" title=""><noscript><img src="https://illuminatipropaganda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Juche-1024x681.jpg" alt="Juche Religion North Korea" class="wp-image-1105" title=""></noscript><figcaption>Arirang Mass Games in Pyongyang, Image by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:North_Korea_%E2%80%94_Pyongyang,_Arirang_(Mass_Games)_(1027131711).jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(stephan)</a> &#8211; CC 2.0 </figcaption></figure>



<p>While we approach the end of this article, we <strong>can&#8217;t avoid mentioning Juche</strong>. </p>



<p>The <strong>official ideology of North Korea</strong> is a Kim Il Sung original elaboration of Marxism-Leninism keen on Personality Cult. </p>



<p>It is propagated through education and media, permeating <strong>every aspect of the life in the country</strong>.</p>



<p>Although atheist in nature, <strong>there&#8217;s some magic in it</strong>, eg the claim that the Kims can do <em>Chukjibeop</em>&nbsp;(축지법), a <strong>distance-shrinking charm</strong>.</p>



<p>This, along with its emphasis on a <em>Sacred</em> Leader-Father and <strong>mass rituals</strong> (like the Arirang games) led some scholars to <strong>consider it</strong><em> </em><strong>a religion.</strong></p>



<p>But this would mean also including <strong>most totalitarisms and the so-called</strong> civic religions in this category.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m ok with that, as long as we finally decide to call Michael Jackson Cult, Maoism, and <a href="https://illuminatipropaganda.com/fun-facts-judaism-false-messiah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump Messianism</a> religions, too.</p>



<p>Before you go, take your time to enjoy the wonderful song<strong> &#8220;The General uses Chukjibeop&#8221;</strong>(장군님 축지법 쓰신다).</p>
