<p>But there&#8217;s one good news, we still can change this if we act now. But action must be immediate and decisive, there&#8217;s no more time for compromise and declarations of good will.</p>

<h2>A brief explanation of why we are involved in this project</h2>
<p>As we are writing this, we are sitting on a terrace facing the beautiful Indian Ocean in Mozambique. As, we hope, most of you know, Mozambique was recently hit by two consecutive cyclons among the strongest of its history: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Idai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Idai</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/cyclone-kenneth-begins-landfall-northern-mozambique-190425182138888.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kenneth</a>. Those two deadly storms affected millions of people, causing thousands of fatalities.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, since we started traveling the world by bicycle in 2014, we often come across extreme meteorological events which are usually &#8220;the most powerful ever recorded&#8221; in a certain area. We are experiencing climate change first-hand, and it&#8217;s not pleasant.</p>
<p>Sea level rising is also an evident truth, in Maputo (the Mozambican capital), the sea is expected to rise by 10 cm by 2030 (low scenario) and, between 20 cm and 100 cm by 2060 (medium scenario) &#8211; <a href="http://urbanresiliencehub.org/city-hazards/maputo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>. Devastation will hit cities, infrastructure, crops, people.</p>
<p>When, a few weeks ago, we were contacted by <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200924013527/http://supportearthscall.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earth&#8217;s Call</a></strong> for a collaboration to spread the word about their event and concrete action we were intrigued. We, of course, did our researches about this foundation and found them to be seriously committed, so we accepted their proposal, agreeing on adding our small voice to the choir of those calling for immediate action.</p>

<h2>Some words on climate change</h2>
<p>Based on a vast scientific literature, we know that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earth’s climate is changing in ways inconsistent with natural variability.</li>
<li>The principal cause is the build-up of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping substances (e.g., methane) emitted mainly by the burning of fossil fuels for electricity production, the increasing use of land in ways that limit its ability to absorb greenhouse gases (pastures and intensive cultivations).</li>
<li>Harmful impacts are already being experienced around the world.</li>
<li>Negative impacts will only increase in intensity until emissions are drastically reduced.</li>
<li>Any scenario for meeting the 2-degree goal means reducing global emissions sharply in the next decade.</li>
<li>The starting point is that a small number of countries are responsible for a very large share of global emissions. The three largest emitters, in order, are China, the United States, and India.</li>
</ul>
<p>China is the world’s largest emitter, but when considering per-capita emission, it&#8217;s clear that richer countries are those that will mostly have to address their living standards. Moreover, while China increasingly understands the dangers of air pollution and climate change, and is moving toward cleaner energy, The United States (the largest emitter historically) yet continues to lack a cohesive national approach to addressing climate change.</p>
<p>India’s emissions are projected to surpass China’s, with 80 percent of projected emissions to come from sources not yet built; this provides an opportunity to make long-term, beneficial decisions now. The <a href="https://cycloscope.net/sites-like-workaway-alternatives" title="The Best Help-Exchange Websites. How to Work for Free Accommodation Worldwide">working</a> theory of change is based on the premise that, if the United States, China, and India exert global leadership on climate change, then other nations will be compelled to act.</p>
<p>Those players so will have to implement policies, actions, and investments in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>decrease the carbon-intensity of their respective economies;</li>
<li>reduce greenhouse gas emissions;</li>
<li>build political will and public demand for climate solutions;</li>
<li>do so by no later than 2025;</li>
</ul>
<p>If these three nations meet their ambitious emissions reductions targets, then other nations will be compelled to act and meet their own targets, which collectively would result in the world abating catastrophic climate change. An urgent situation based on the UN IPCC estimates that only 25- 60 harvests may be left on earth!</p>

<h2>What is Earth&#8217;s Call</h2>
<p>Among the many entities involved in the struggle for a rapid &#8220;U-Turn&#8221; is Earth&#8217;s Call Foundation, a group of people whose common aim is to find real solutions to the climate crisis. By raising funds to implement these solutions, Earth&#8217;s Call Foundation tries to have an effective impact in reversing the disastrous trend we&#8217;re living.</p>
<p>Earth&#8217;s Call is building partnerships with a number of like-minded international organizations that also want to tackle the world&#8217;s most challenging and complex problem: rising global temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>Earth&#8217;s Call is an event that will take place in Aspen (Colorado) on 17th and 18th May 2019</strong>. A series of conferences, talks, concert, and shows that will hopefully help to change people&#8217;s, governments, and companies&#8217; consciousness.</p>
<p>You can find more information about the schedule of the event in the last paragraph of this article.</p>
<hr>
<h2>SDG 17, Partnership Goals</h2>
<p>Earth&#8217;s Call is guided by the principles of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, particularly <a href="https://www.globalgoals.org/17-partnerships-for-the-goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SDG 17, Partnerships</a>; those goals are:</p>
<p><strong>Finance</strong></p>
<p><strong>17.1&nbsp;</strong>Strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax and other revenue collection</p>

<h2>Who are Earth&#8217;s Call Partners</h2>
</div>
<p>Earth&#8217;s Call Foundation is partnering with other committed players in order to achieve those goals effectively.</p>
<h3>Lever for Change</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.macfound.org/programs/lever-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lever for Change</a></strong> is a MacArthur Foundation new affiliate, supporting creative people, effective institutions, and influential networks who share the common mission of building a more just, verdant, and peaceful world. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Macarthur Foundation strongly addresses issues of over-incarceration, global climate change, nuclear risk, while significantly increasing financial capital for the social sector.</p>
<p>MacArthur is one of the largest independent foundations in the US. Organizations supported by the Foundation work in about 40 countries. In addition to Chicago, MacArthur has offices in India, Mexico, and Nigeria.</p>
<h3><strong>Carbon Underground</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://thecarbonunderground.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carbon Underground</a>, as the name suggests, is focused on carbon emissions. There is no solution to climate change that does not include drawing carbon back down from our atmosphere. There is no mechanism with the scale, ability, and immediacy to draw adequate amounts of carbon back down to mitigate climate change other than the restoration of soil.</p>
<p>To help solve this issue The Carbon Underground focuses on five key areas: <strong>Corporate Impact, Education &amp; Training, Policy, Communications, and Adopt-a-Meter</strong>.</p>
<p>We are also building a diverse coalition of companies, organizations, schools, and governments to create global climate stability through the widespread conversion of farms and ranches into regenerative enterprises. You can find more specific project information in <a href="https://thecarbonunderground.org/about-us/what-we-do-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this section of their website</a>.</p>
