<h2 class="has-text-align-center paragraph">Our Reportage from The Artgene Festival, Tbilissi, Georgia<strong><br></strong></h2>



<p>Today begins the Artgene, this stuff <a href="http://www.artgeni.ge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>



<p>Basically, a traditional Georgian music festival that lasts seven days when each day is dedicated to a region of Georgia. The festival takes place at the Ethnographic Museum, an outdoor museum, in a large park near the Turtle lake.</p>



<p>We arrive in perfect timing for the beginning of the festival, the entrance costs 10 lari (about 4 euro), the performances are held in an outdoor amphitheater. Today the weather is not the best, there are some clouds.</p>



<p>At 19, the festival begins, on stage seamlessly performances of children, elders, adults, women and men; musicians, dancers, singers. The whole day is dedicated to the Samegrelo region, the region of Zugdidi. After a couple of hours, a downpour starts and we are forced to flee, there are not many shelters!</p>



<p>We get a bottle of Saperavi (pretty lousy) waiting for the performances to resume. In fact, the shower does not last long but nothing portends that the festival will go on. The stage has been dismantled but at some point, we see people at work on another stage.</p>



<p>Finally, at about 22 something begins, is the concert of Georgian armed forces military band! Watching the show we are no more than twenty persons (including insiders and journalists). I would say that the concert is fairly negligible.</p>



<p>It is a typical fanfare of horns performing a predictable modern band repertoire. We&#8217;ll be back tomorrow hoping that the weather will assist us.</p>

<h2>Artgene Festival &#8211; Regions &amp; Traditional Music</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/58fb737ee15f2_artgene-festival-2014-a-panning-shot-over-georgian-traditional-music.jpg" alt="Immagine" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/58fb737ee15f2_artgene-festival-2014-a-panning-shot-over-georgian-traditional-music.jpg" alt="Immagine" title=""></noscript></figure>



<p>After yet another lunch of khinkali, at 18:30 we&#8217;re back at the <strong>ArtGene</strong>. The day is dedicated to <strong>Abkhazia</strong>&nbsp;and the region&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>Mtskheta-Mtianeti</strong>. When opening&nbsp;an old blind man&nbsp;takes the stage,&nbsp;accompanied&nbsp;by the acclaim of the large audience and by the&nbsp;lovely daughter of no more than&nbsp;four years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The man&nbsp;speaks at length and with intensity, punctuated&nbsp;by the&nbsp;thunderous&nbsp;applause&nbsp;of the auditorium;&nbsp;obviously we do not understand&nbsp;anything and&nbsp;we have no idea&nbsp;who he is,&nbsp;most likely&nbsp;a&nbsp;Georgian&nbsp;Abkhazian, maybe&nbsp;a writer or a&nbsp;poet.</p>



<p>After the speech, the music begins: once again all ages are represented, the groups of children are many, quite good (some are really young). And then the numerous formations of dancers, with men who perform acrobatics full of energy and vigor and women who have interesting choreographies in beautiful traditional costumes.</p>



<p>The types of music are basically three: the&nbsp;<strong>polyphonic choirs</strong>,&nbsp;based&nbsp;on subtle&nbsp;dissonances&nbsp;between the voices; t<strong>he&nbsp;song form</strong>,&nbsp;accompanied by&nbsp;<strong>Panduri</strong>&nbsp;(small&nbsp;three-stringed lute),&nbsp;<strong>Chunguri</strong>&nbsp;(larger lute,&nbsp;four-stringed),&nbsp;<strong>Doli</strong>&nbsp;(twin-side cylindrical&nbsp;drum&nbsp;played with fingers), and sometimes&nbsp;flute&nbsp;(<strong>Salamuri</strong>)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Changi</strong>&nbsp;(a sort of&nbsp;triangular&nbsp;harp&nbsp;);&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>instrumental music</strong>&nbsp;to accompany the&nbsp;<strong>dance</strong>&nbsp;(same instruments but&nbsp;different rhythms).</p>



<p>The most&nbsp;stunning thing is the vitality&nbsp;of this tradition,&nbsp;felt like&nbsp;something up-to-date and experienced&nbsp;in everyday life,&nbsp;and not, as&nbsp;is often the case&nbsp;elsewhere (eg&nbsp;in&nbsp;Italy),&nbsp;with&nbsp;a sort of&nbsp;parodistic or&nbsp;pseudo-philological&nbsp;&#8220;folklorism&#8221;,&nbsp;disconnected from&nbsp;real context&nbsp;of&nbsp;belonging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Georgians&nbsp;sing&nbsp;at the table,&nbsp;or while drinking&nbsp;with friends,&nbsp;listen and&nbsp;know&nbsp;in depth&nbsp;the&nbsp;repertoire&nbsp;of their own region, and often&nbsp;that of the other,&nbsp;there are many&nbsp;radio&nbsp;exclusively dedicated&nbsp;to traditional music.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this&nbsp;attitude, which some&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;connect,&nbsp;perhaps&nbsp;not unreasonably, to the&nbsp;strong sense of Georgian nationalism, the musical heritage&nbsp;of this nation&nbsp;is alive&nbsp;and constantly evolving,&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cultural&nbsp;route&nbsp;that&nbsp;leads&nbsp;from&nbsp;ancestral times&nbsp;to the present day.</p>



<h2>Artegene &#8211; The Performances</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/58fb738036439_artgene-festival-2014-a-panning-shot-over-georgian-traditional-music.jpg" alt="Picture" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/58fb738036439_artgene-festival-2014-a-panning-shot-over-georgian-traditional-music.jpg" alt="Picture" title=""></noscript></figure>



<p>The performances are dozens, some very short so that everyone has the opportunity to present at least one song. The fact that the festival lasts a week gives the idea of how many schools and groups there are in such a small country like Georgia; also the average level is quite high.</p>



<p>We enjoy&nbsp;the&nbsp;show in&nbsp;the front row,&nbsp;armed with&nbsp;camera&nbsp;and&nbsp;recorder, until to the&nbsp;spectacle of a&nbsp;group of &#8220;warriors&#8221;, armed with&nbsp;swords, shields, maces-whip&nbsp;and other amenities, medieval&nbsp;accompanied by music,&nbsp;performing mad fights with sparks coming out at the crossing&nbsp;of the blades.</p>



<p>Among them is&nbsp;a girl, very&nbsp;good,&nbsp;but&nbsp;the main attraction is&nbsp;a big bearded guy,&nbsp;clearly&nbsp;drunk,&nbsp;that&nbsp;during his turn&nbsp;is likely to fall&nbsp;and even break&nbsp;a&nbsp;spotlight.</p>



<p>After this exhilarating display of martial virulence, we go to take the usual bottle of wine, the same Saperavi of yesterday is the cheapest one.<br>Shortly after the concert&nbsp;of the main group begins, again the most disappointing part&nbsp;of the evening.An attempt to&nbsp;mix&nbsp;between&nbsp;traditional music and&nbsp;&#8220;Western&#8221; genres (rock, reggae, funk), unfortunately,&nbsp;very scarce success.</p>



<p>On the way back we take a taxi and the taxi driver shoots a crazy fee (15 lari, about three times the normal rate) we&#8217;re quite pissed off and fucks him off with 6 lari, which is also too much.</p>
