<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Things to do, see, and experience in Baku<br>Some not-fun facts about the dictatorship in Azerbaijan</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan, the core of the dictatorship, the temple of the oligarchs. With a population of 2,374,000, this is the only big city in Azerbaijan, if you really want to feel the mood of the country that&#8217;s where you should be, but be aware (and I&#8217;m sorry to say that), it is not a great mood.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we&#8217;ll describe our experience in the windy city of the Caucasus, I don&#8217;t know if this will help anyone planning a trip here, but if you&#8217;re thinking of visiting Baku you might find it interesting. Check also this list of <a href="https://www.meganstarr.com/visit-baku-azerbaijan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">things to know before visiting Baku</a>.</p>



<h2>How the hell we got here</h2>



<p>After bicycle touring the whole length of Azerbaijan from the southern border with Georgia, <a href="https://cycloscope.net/azerbaijan-bicycle-touring">Elena collapses less than a hundred km from Baku</a>. We just took a bus and arrived here, where a friend of a friend will host us for a few days.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Arrived at Baku&#8217;s bus station we ask a taxi driver how much he wants to take us to the house of the guy who will host and&nbsp;he&nbsp;shoot us a ridiculous amount of money, something like 30 euro. Besides,&nbsp;he&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t even know where the address is.</p>



<p>Some other gentlemen tell us the taxi drivers&nbsp;are crazy and give us directions.<br>Elena is still pale green, but we find out that the place is very close, so we try to cycle.</p>



<p>We immediately find the street, but the house number is a problem. The road is a string of Soviet apartment blocks without house numbers and without bells.</p>



<p>Fortunately, while we wander back and forth, Ismail&nbsp;(fictional name)&nbsp;appears before us. The father was playing chess somewhere and saw us passing, so he warned the son.</p>



<p>He lives on the 9th floor, luckily there&#8217;s an elevator and on a few trips we can bring all our things. We&#8217;ve been together for an hour, then he and his wife go out and Elena goes almost immediately to sleep.</p>



<h2>The Caspian Oil-Pond-Front</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/baku-where-the-stinky-wind-blows.jpg" alt="Picture" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/baku-where-the-stinky-wind-blows.jpg" alt="Picture" title=""></noscript></figure>



<p>The apartment&nbsp;is really&nbsp;nice and&nbsp;big,&nbsp;we have a&nbsp;room&nbsp;all to ourselves.&nbsp;Baku&nbsp;is&nbsp;hot&nbsp;but luckily&nbsp;ventilated&nbsp;and,&nbsp;here&nbsp;on the 9th floor,&nbsp;even more.<br>They say&nbsp;<strong>the meaning of&nbsp;&#8220;Baku&#8221;&nbsp;is &#8220;the city&nbsp;where the wind blows&#8221;.</strong></p>



<p>Our main aim here is to get visas for Uzbekistan and find out how to take the ship<a href="https://cycloscope.net/caspian-ferry-baku-aktau-kazakhstan-azerbaijan"> to cross the Caspian Sea</a>. Today and tomorrow though are holidays (for the end of Ramadan) so port and embassy are closed. We&#8217;ll go on a tour of the city. Around 6 PM we go out together with Ismail, he too must go downtown.</p>



<p>We&nbsp;take the&nbsp;subway,&nbsp;which is quite cheap.&nbsp;<strong>Everything else instead is&nbsp;very expensive</strong>.&nbsp;Especially&nbsp;the supermarkets here are more expensive than&nbsp;in northern Italy (and&nbsp;it is not easy), and salaries&nbsp;are quite&nbsp;low.&nbsp;As far as&nbsp;we understand&nbsp;a&nbsp;teacher&nbsp;earns something like&nbsp;300 euro&nbsp;per month.</p>



<p>Out of the subway, on May 28 street (May 28th is the Republic Day), we find the usual statue of the former president and the usual quote. They are everywhere in Azerbaijan.</p>



<p>After the&nbsp;square,&nbsp;we head&nbsp;towards the Caspian seafront, which we could&nbsp;also call&nbsp;oil-pond-front.&nbsp;The avenue&nbsp;is&nbsp;perfect, everything&nbsp;spotless,&nbsp;manicured&nbsp;gardens,&nbsp;not&nbsp;a cigarette butt&nbsp;on the ground&nbsp;(as befits&nbsp;a&nbsp;regime).</p>



<p>But the Caspian sea is black, literally. That is, it&#8217;s oil, and it smells a lot. To see the fishes swim there eating crumbs and oil is very impressive. Doesn&#8217;t really inspire a fish meal in Baku.</p>



<p>But the people&nbsp;here are sitting and enjoying,&nbsp;looking at the sea&nbsp;as if they are&nbsp;in&nbsp;Sorrento.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>A first-hand account of the political repression in Baku</h2>



<p>Petrol&nbsp;is cheap&nbsp;(60&nbsp;cents per liter),&nbsp;and people are&nbsp;wealthier than in the countryside,&nbsp;or&nbsp;at least&nbsp;so it seems.&nbsp;For sure they are&nbsp;richer&nbsp;than Georgians.&nbsp;And all thanks&nbsp;to the&nbsp;puddle&nbsp;of oil that&nbsp;they face.</p>



<p>They say that<strong>&nbsp;in ten&nbsp;years&nbsp;the&nbsp;oil will be over</strong>, but nobody&nbsp;seems to care&nbsp;much.&nbsp;The oligarchs&nbsp;have already&nbsp;accumulated enough&nbsp;<em>Manat&nbsp;</em>and have&nbsp;another ten&nbsp;years to&nbsp;accumulate&nbsp;even more.</p>



<p>And&nbsp;the common people&nbsp;do not even know&nbsp;about&nbsp;this theory,&nbsp;the information is&nbsp;controlled by the government,&nbsp;those who try to&nbsp;say something different&nbsp;(not just&nbsp;about&nbsp;oil)&nbsp;are arrested on&nbsp;absurd&nbsp;pretexts.</p>



<p>So, for who&nbsp;doesn&#8217;t have&nbsp;access&nbsp;to the internet,&nbsp;or&nbsp;maybe&nbsp;has never been&nbsp;abroad&nbsp;and, above all,&nbsp;only&nbsp;knows&nbsp;the&nbsp;Azeri language,&nbsp;it is not easy&nbsp;to form an opinion.&nbsp;Although,&nbsp;of course, everyone is&nbsp;aware of living&nbsp;in&nbsp;a dictatorship,&nbsp;I guess.</p>



<p>Ismail is part of a group of political dissidents, that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re using a fake name. Because of the upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_European_Games" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>European Olympic Games</strong></a>, there has been a recent crackdown on all the voices of dissent, even worse than usual.</p>



<p>To prevent any kind of action that could draw attention to the lack of democracy, freedom, and the other many political issues of Azerbaijan,<strong> the government arrested everybody they could guess to be connected with independent political groups</strong>.</p>



<p>Among these, there are many friends of Ismail, just today they arrested the lawyer who usually defends political dissidents. The accusations are always ridiculous, such as supporting Armenia; even worst, often the police place drugs in the houses or belongings of the victim, so to charge him/her with drug dealing.</p>



<p>Most of the time, <strong>the convict has two choices: go to jail or enroll in the army</strong>. Needless to say, who choose to enroll will be sent to the most dangerous positions in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nagorno-Karabakh war</a>, where they&#8217;ll be&nbsp;constant victims of hazing.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left paragraph">Baku&#8217;s Old Town</h2>



<p>Going back to our&nbsp;tour, we must say&nbsp;there isn&#8217;t&nbsp;a lot of traffic&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;Tbilisi&nbsp;and drivers&nbsp;do not seem&nbsp;psychopaths. It even happens that&nbsp;they stop&nbsp;to let you&nbsp;cross the street.</p>



<p>After&nbsp;our walk&nbsp;along the shore,&nbsp;we head to <strong>Baku&#8217;s old town</strong>. As far as we understood, until the discovery of oil in the nineteenth century (the first drilling of the world was made here), Baku was a village in the desert, ok, on the sea, but still in the desert, with a few thousand inhabitants; and in fact, this old town is very small.</p>



<p>The wall and the houses are&nbsp;completely&nbsp;restored,&nbsp;they now look&nbsp;&#8220;falsely&nbsp;old&#8221;.&nbsp;In short,&nbsp;the&nbsp;cleaning&nbsp;and rebuilding were a bit too much.</p>



<p>It seems&nbsp;that after the earthquake&nbsp;of the year 2000, <strong>UNESCO&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;remove Baku Old Town from its list</strong>, due to the&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;restructuring,&nbsp;but it has&nbsp;been restored&nbsp;in&nbsp;this barbaric&nbsp;way&nbsp;and&nbsp;UNESCO has&nbsp;readmitted it.&nbsp;Congratulations. Sure,&nbsp;a nice postcard for tourists.</p>



<p>We walk back towards&nbsp;home,&nbsp;passing through&nbsp;more&nbsp;&#8220;peripheral&#8221; streets.&nbsp;There we see a&nbsp;more genuine Baku,&nbsp;even&nbsp;enjoyable.</p>



<p>But the fact remains&nbsp;that it&#8217;s&nbsp;a 2 and a half million inhabitants city,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it&#8217;s dead.&nbsp;In the evening&nbsp;there&#8217;s&nbsp;nobody around and in&nbsp;the center, there are&nbsp;very few pubs or bars.&nbsp;At best,&nbsp;someone&nbsp;playing&nbsp;backgammon&nbsp;in front of&nbsp;a&nbsp;house or&nbsp;in&nbsp;some other place where only tea is served.</p>



<p>No women of course. Indeed, since we entered Azerbaijan we never saw a woman driving. And when in the car they always sit in the back.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-left paragraph">Uzbekistan Visa application in Baku</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/58fd814da4ce9_baku-where-the-stinky-wind-blows.jpg" alt="Baku old town" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/58fd814da4ce9_baku-where-the-stinky-wind-blows.jpg" alt="Baku old town" title=""></noscript><figcaption>Baku old town</figcaption></figure>



<p>The next day&nbsp;we go&nbsp;to the Uzbek embassy,&nbsp;pretty hard to find.&nbsp;The address&nbsp;written&nbsp;on their&nbsp;website is&nbsp;something like &#8220;freeway&nbsp;street, house&nbsp;n °&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;but I doubt&nbsp;that&nbsp;this is the way they call this place&nbsp;in&nbsp;Azeri, and in fact,&nbsp;no one&nbsp;knows.</p>



<p>Fortunately,&nbsp;there&#8217;s a lady&nbsp;on the bus&nbsp;who helps us&nbsp;in the research,&nbsp;goes down the bus with&nbsp;us&nbsp;and ask&nbsp;anyone.&nbsp;In the end, we see a&nbsp;long-haired blond&nbsp;dude,&nbsp;he knows,&nbsp;he comes from there.&nbsp;Just the fact&nbsp;that it exists&nbsp;is&nbsp;a consolation.</p>



<p>The slowness&nbsp;of the employee&nbsp;is&nbsp;incredible, it takes&nbsp;about ten minutes to&nbsp;hand over&nbsp;the sheet&nbsp;to be filled for&nbsp;the&nbsp;application.&nbsp;The man&nbsp;tells us&nbsp;that next week&nbsp;the visa&nbsp;should be ready.&nbsp;He goes out with&nbsp;us&nbsp;to smoke a cigarette, it&#8217;s a&nbsp;weird man,&nbsp;he&nbsp;looks really&nbsp;drunk.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<h2>Ferry to Kazakhstan, inquiring at the port of Baku</h2>



<p>After&nbsp;the embassy&nbsp;we leave for&nbsp;another visit&nbsp;to the port, to check about the&nbsp;<a href="https://cycloscope.net/escape-from-baku-a-ferry-to-the-steppe"><strong>Baku &#8211; Aktau ferry</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The road to the&nbsp;harbor&nbsp;is full&nbsp;of the usual&nbsp;&#8220;fake gardens&#8221;&nbsp;constantly&nbsp;under the sun,&nbsp;but with a&nbsp;perfect lawn&nbsp;and&nbsp;pruned plants.&nbsp;Always&nbsp;deserted.&nbsp;Across the road are the usual&nbsp;reptilian&nbsp;buildings,&nbsp;reptile-egg-shaped, to be specific.</p>



<p>We enter the&nbsp;harbor&nbsp;by&nbsp;a dirt road, no indication. The only&nbsp;clue&nbsp;we have is that&nbsp;<strong>the ticket office&nbsp;is located behind&nbsp;&#8220;gray&nbsp;heavy&nbsp;door&#8221;</strong>, and&nbsp;fortunately&nbsp;we recognize it&nbsp;immediately.</p>



<p>On the door, many stickers were glued by tourists who passed before us. The only problem is that the office is closed and there is no one around. We walk towards the ships to look for someone, we meet a policeman with another guy, apparently the clerk. They speak only Russian.</p>



<p>The clerk tells us&nbsp;<strong>the ticket costs&nbsp;$110</strong>.&nbsp;We understand <strong>it must be done on the day of the departure</strong>.&nbsp;Cash only.&nbsp;Let&#8217;s hope&nbsp;it&#8217;s true.&nbsp;Anyway,&nbsp;we go back&nbsp;home happy&nbsp;to have concluded&nbsp;something.</p>



<p>Here in Baku, there&#8217;s not much to see, so while waiting for the Uzbek visa, we&#8217;ll go visit Ismail cousin, who lives near<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://cycloscope.net/ivanovka-travel-kholkoz-azerbaijan">Ivanovka</a> one of the last <em>kolkhoz</em> of former Soviet Union,</strong> <strong><a href="https://cycloscope.net/lahic-travel-azerbaijan-copper">Lahic</a></strong>, up in the Caucasus, <strong>famous for the copper crafts and the typical houses</strong>, and <a href="https://cycloscope.net/xinaliq-caucasus-azerbaijan"><strong>Khinalug, the highest village in Europe</strong></a>.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left paragraph">How not to get a visa for Uzbekistan in Baku</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone galleryImageBorder wsite-image"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/escape-from-baku-a-ferry-to-the-steppe.jpg" alt="uzbekstan visa baku" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/escape-from-baku-a-ferry-to-the-steppe.jpg" alt="uzbekstan visa baku" title=""></noscript><figcaption>Baku as&nbsp;seen from the port</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left paragraph"><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cycloscope.net/xinaliq-caucasus-azerbaijan">After our adventures in the Caucasus</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">, we&#8217;re back into the Baku&#8217;s pollution. The nose again encrusted.</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left paragraph">We call the Uzbek embassy, guess what? The visa is not ready yet. It is not clear why. Our Azeri visa is expiring, so we go to the embassy to understand what&#8217;s going on.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left paragraph">And here we are at the embassy, in full combat gear. In front of the gate are three other cyclists, a British couple, and another English lady, lonely hitchhiker at the age of 60, cool woman.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left paragraph">We all have made the application on the same day, almost two weeks ago, and no news, for no one. Something must have gone wrong that day.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left paragraph">After more than an hour waiting, we enter the embassy, the console tells us that he didn&#8217;t get any news from Tashkent, that his job is to check every 3 hours on the computer and he can&#8217;t do anything else and blablabla.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left paragraph">Sure enough, when we made the application he was drunk, so it&#8217;s likely that he had just completely forgotten to send the papers to Tashkent.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left paragraph">Then, he says absurd things like &#8220;maybe you should apply from Bishkek because it is closer to Tashkent and so easier to get a visa&#8221; (wtf?!) I was not aware that fax was traveling by pigeons in Central Asia.</p>
