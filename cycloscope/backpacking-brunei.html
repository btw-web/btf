<h2 class="wsite-content-title">Few facts about Brunei</h2>



<p><strong>Brunei</strong> is one of the only two remaining Sultanates in the world, the other being Oman, it <strong>has the 4th GDP per capita in the world</strong> (World Bank source, 2015) and <strong>the Sultan is the 4th richest Royal</strong> (Forbes), indeed crossing into this small state the wealth difference from the not-so-poor Malaysia is astounding.</p>



<p>Although only 5,765 square kilometres big, Brunei still doesn&#8217;t make it in the <a href="https://howdareshe.org/the-smallest-countries-in-the-world-by-size" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top 10 smallest countries in the world</a>, but very small it is indeed, enough to be crossed in only one day on a bicycle.</p>



<p>Brunei is divided into two parts, not connected to each other, both surrounded by Sarawak, we&#8217;ll call them &#8220;Small Brunei&#8221; (27km) and &#8220;Big Brunei&#8221;.<br>Kilometers indications in this article are meant from Beaufort.</p>



<h2 class="wsite-content-title">From Beaufort to Lawas</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/borneo-wm_1_orig.jpg" alt="longboat Lawas river, Sarawak, Borneo" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/borneo-wm_1_orig.jpg" alt="longboat Lawas river, Sarawak, Borneo" title=""></noscript><figcaption>A longboat on the Lawas river, Sarawak, Borneo</figcaption></figure>



<p>From the negligible town of Beaufort the ride is flat, indeed here they appear, on the left and on the right, <strong>endless</strong> <strong>plantations of oil palms</strong>.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a short stretch where the situation improves a bit, next to the Klias Forest Reserve, the landscape reminds us of the Philippines, green rice fields and majestic mountains on the horizon.</p>



<p>After 44 km we cross <strong>Sipitang</strong>, a coastal village with brown sea water, perhaps because of the monsoons or perhaps for the nearby refineries, there&#8217;s a boardwalk with <strong>a lot of restaurants</strong> here, good for a lunch stopover.</p>



<p>We cross <strong>the</strong> <strong>border between Sabah and Sarawak,</strong> they stamp the passports as if we are crossing the border of two different countries. Sarawak and Sabah are the two regions that make up the Malaysian part of Borneo.</p>



<h2 class="wsite-content-title">Palm oil camping</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/p1280763-01_orig.jpeg" alt="free camping in a oil palm plantation Borneo" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/p1280763-01_orig.jpeg" alt="free camping in a oil palm plantation Borneo" title=""></noscript><figcaption>Free camping in a oil palm plantation</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a short while, the oil palms begin again, <strong>we pitch a tent in one of those plantations</strong>, we go look for somebody to ask permission but see nobody around but mice. Near the tent, there is a mysterious source of water.</p>



<p>Deforestation to make room for the palms destroyed rivers and streams, but this odd source is here, forms a pond of two square meters with a lot of fish, looks quite deep and the water is clear, good to get rid of the sweat. We sleep well enough through another rainy night. 65km today, taking it easy.</p>



<p>In the morning, we cross a small hill from where it&#8217;s possible to realize the immensity of the plantations, &#8217;til the horizon. But at least there is something nice to see in this area, the <strong>traditional stilted houses</strong>, beautiful and colorful, mostly made of wood, with manicured gardens and flowers beds.</p>



<p>At km95 there&#8217;s the small river town of <strong>Lawas</strong>, which has plenty of accommodations, some interesting stilted villages out of town and a boat connection o the Tax-Free island of <strong>Labuan</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wsite-content-title">From Lawas to Limbang: across Small Brunei</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/p1280822-01_orig.jpeg" alt="Bicycle Touring Brunei Borneo" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/p1280822-01_orig.jpeg" alt="Bicycle Touring Brunei Borneo" title=""></noscript><figcaption>The road near Lawas</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Around 120km from Beaufort is the first Brunei border</strong>. Entering the Small Brunei, not even a flag or a &#8220;welcome in Brunei&#8221; greets us, so no souvenir photo here. This part of Brunei is easy to cross in less than two hours, <strong>just 27km from border to border</strong>.</p>



<p>There are very few houses and the forest is almost on the road, here they have so much oil they may not need to plant oil palms, their kind of oil is much more valuable. <strong>So the atmosphere is very different from Malaysia, much wilder</strong>. Indeed the Sultanate is very committed in the preservation of its forest and it is also developing forms of <a href="https://timetravelbee.com/places/responsible-tourism-in-brunei" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsible tourism in Brunei</a>.</p>



<p>We see a few large gray monkeys in the trees (macaques), loud sounds of insects never heard before filling the air, or maybe they are birds. One sounds like a dog and another like a firework always about to explode but never doing it. <strong>We like this part of Brunei</strong>.</p>



<p>The only town here is <strong>Bangar</strong>, near the border with Malaysia, very nice and tidy, there are a few small but cute mosques.</p>



<p>Without even noticing we are back in Malaysia. The road to Limbang, the next town, is densely populated, beautiful stilted houses again, there are not many places for the tent, 15km from the border and we get to the town of <strong>Limbang</strong> to find a cheap hotel.</p>



<p>Limbang is not that bad, has a nice riverside, from where to watch the longboat go past, on the other side of the river rudimentary spilings are surrounded by mangroves.</p>



<h2 class="wsite-content-title">Across Big Brunei, to Miri</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/p1280743-01_orig.jpeg" alt="tipical malay house" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/p1280743-01_orig.jpeg" alt="tipical malay house" title=""></noscript><figcaption>A typical Malay house</figcaption></figure>



<p>43 flat kilometers past Limbang, we are in the <strong>&#8220;Big&#8221; Brunei</strong>, the larger part, where the Sultan lives and where the capital is. This is about 60km from part to part.</p>



<p><strong>Very important: there are no money exchange nor ATM until you reach Tutong! Change your money in Limbang!</strong>Not knowing the prices in the <em>Sultanat</em> we eat at a Chinese restaurant just before the border.</p>



<p>Past the checkpoint (<strong>30 days visa free for most nationalities</strong>) we immediately notice the difference in wealth: the houses are big and luxurious, in front of each villa at least 4 or 5 cars are parked; cars are very cheap here, no taxes.</p>



<p>This part of Brunei is more urbanized, the first 45 km have a few unremarkable hills, a supermarket and not much else, we have no money and no water, luckily an Indian guy buys us some liquids.</p>



<h2 class="wsite-content-title">Oily ways</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/p1280861-01_orig.jpeg" alt="Seria, Brunei" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/p1280861-01_orig.jpeg" alt="Seria, Brunei" title=""></noscript><figcaption>The &#8220;skyline&#8221; of Seria, Brunei</figcaption></figure>



<p>We arrive in <strong>Tutong</strong>, the small town where we can finally withdraw some cash. We plan to sleep on a platform along the riverwalk but the sign <strong>&#8220;danger crocodiles&#8221;</strong> makes us change our mind.</p>



<p>We ask for <strong>hotels</strong> in town, there&#8217;s only one apparently, about <strong>60USD per night</strong>! We get on a little hill above a football field and assemble the tent, where we take refuge quickly, it is full of mosquitoes. Urban stealth camping.</p>



<p>The next morning we have breakfast in a bakery shop in the center of the town and leave again, from here the road is not very nice, a busy highway until <strong>Seria</strong>, where most of the refineries are. Seria is a town full of expats working for <strong>oil companies</strong>, it&#8217;s not a nice place but an aspect of Brunei that is interesting to experience.</p>



<p>Everywhere are <strong>chimneys on fire</strong>, some small roads lead to the sea, water is green/brownish and many extraction platform line the horizon. The only pleasant thing is the restaurant where we have lunch, more expensive compared to Malaysia, but really delicious, fried breaded mussels for me and a tofu soup for Elena, the menu is endless.</p>



<h2 class="wsite-content-title">Astounding close encounters of the 3rd kind</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/p1280862-01_orig.jpeg" alt="Kampung Pandan Mosque Kuala Belai.

Brunei" title=""></noscript><figcaption>Kampung Pandan Mosque in Kuala Belai. Brunei</figcaption></figure>



<p>Leaving Seria, things get nicer and we have the most unexpected encounter. For this last 20 km Brunei gets really narrow, we are surrounded by nature, the road is quite and the only noises are bird and insects.</p>



<p>Then it happens, <strong>two hornbills, in the middle of the road!</strong> I try to approach quietly, they fly to a nearby tree, I still can see them. Hornbills are large-beaked birds, very rare and on the verge of extinction, the one we see are <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros_hornbill" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rhinoceros Hornbills</a></strong>, the symbol of Sarawak, recognizable from the banana-shaped yellow casque. <strong>There are just a few left</strong>, it&#8217;s very hard to see one in the wild, lucky strike!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;&#8230;s<em>ome <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayak_people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dayak people</a>, especially the Ibanic groups, believe it to be the chief of worldly birds or the supreme worldly bird, and its statue is used to welcome the god of the augural birds, Sengalang Burong, to the feasts and celebrations of humankind</em>&#8220;(Wikipedia).</p></blockquote>



<p>The road is flat and pleasant, forest on our side and many monkeys. One of them apparently wants to kill us and threatens not to get close to the tree where he lives.</p>



<h2 class="wsite-content-title">Strip-tease of the no-man&#8217;s-land</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=&#039;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#039;%20viewBox=&#039;0%200%20370%20247&#039;%3E%3C/svg%3E" class="zeen-lazy-load-base zeen-lazy-load" data-lazy-src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/p1280901-01_orig.jpeg" alt="Rhinoceros Hornbill Brunei Borneo" title=""><noscript><img src="https://cycloscope.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/p1280901-01_orig.jpeg" alt="Rhinoceros Hornbill Brunei Borneo" title=""></noscript><figcaption>A Rhinoceros Hornbill, spotted in Brunei. Sorry for the low quality pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p>We greet Brunei and return to Malaysia, in a couple of days we have collected <strong>ten stamps in the passport</strong>. It &#8216;s almost dark, in the <strong>no-mans-land</strong> between Brunei and Malaysia, there is <strong>a hotel</strong> <strong>with adjoining</strong> <strong>strip club</strong> runt by Chinese people. It seems a funny place and we decide to overnight here. The room is clean, has air-conditioner, hot shower but no windows&#8230;</p>



<p>Many from neighboring Brunei come to spend the evening in this place where there is everything that is forbidden in their home country, especially <strong>beer and all sort of alcohol</strong>, but not less important, <strong>half-naked girls</strong>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a surreal situation, there are Chinese strippers, a Chinese long-haired cook covered in tattoos, a nerd maid and her grandmother who is at the counter doing origami, and counting money. Long live to the Chinese. Welcome back Malaysia.</p>
