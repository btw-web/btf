<h1>Bicycle Touring Tents: Everything You Need To Know</h1>
<p>Tents are my home away from home. They are my space to take a well-deserved break and relax after a long day in the saddle.</p>
<p>Having spent hundreds, if not thousands of nights under sheets of expensive, lightweight, waterproof nylon &#8211; this is what I know about bicycle touring tents.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25035421@N04/11418884934/in/set-72157638760853186" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img  loading="lazy"  id="blogsy-1388630929378.4585"  class="aligncenter pk-lazyload"  src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII="  alt="bicycle touring tents"  width="1000"  height="665"  data-pk-sizes="auto"  data-pk-src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3717/11418884934_981930e7a8_z.jpg" ></a></div>
<h4 id="tent-classification">Tent Classification</h4>
<p><em>In this article I will reference three different types of tent:</em></p>
<figure style="width: 618px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.cyclingabout.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wpid-Photo-31-Dec-2013-1200-pm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img  loading="lazy"  id="blogsy-1388630929364.3862"  src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII="  alt="bicycle touring tents"  width="618"  height="344"  class=" pk-lazyload"  data-pk-sizes="auto"  data-pk-src="https://www.cyclingabout.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wpid-Photo-31-Dec-2013-1200-pm.jpg" ></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Easton Kilo 2P weighs just 997g and will fit two people.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Ultralight:</strong> This type of tent favours weight over all other factors. Ultralight tents are great for short trips in good conditions &#8211; so don&#8217;t expect them to last a long time or be brilliant in wet and windy conditions. A typical problem with ultralight tents is broken poles, so always carry a splint. <em>Typical weight: 800-2000g.</em></p>
<figure style="width: 618px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.cyclingabout.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wpid-Photo-31-Dec-2013-1143-am.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img  loading="lazy"  id="blogsy-1388630929400.5957"  src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII="  alt="bicycle touring tents"  width="618"  height="366"  class=" pk-lazyload"  data-pk-sizes="auto"  data-pk-src="https://www.cyclingabout.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wpid-Photo-31-Dec-2013-1143-am.jpg" ></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The MSR Hubba NX tents are a popular choice as a backpacking tent.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Backpacking:</strong> These mid-weight tents pick up some of the key durability features of 4-season tents and place them in a lighter weight and better ventilating package. Backpacking tents are often great for the average bicycle tour, or for longer journeys in warmer climates. <em>Typical weight: 1500-2800g.</em></p>
<figure style="width: 618px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.cyclingabout.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wpid-Photo-31-Dec-2013-1133-am1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img  loading="lazy"  id="blogsy-1388630929337.5938"  src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII="  alt="bicycle touring tents"  width="618"  height="306"  class=" pk-lazyload"  data-pk-sizes="auto"  data-pk-src="https://www.cyclingabout.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wpid-Photo-31-Dec-2013-1133-am1.jpg" ></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Hilleberg Staika is not light, but is durable and able to withstand any weather conditions.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>4-season:</strong> These tents tend to be most suitable for cool-mid climates and adverse weather conditions. If you&#8217;re planning on hitting sub-zero temperatures, snow and strong winds &#8211; this is what will work best. 4-season tents are often great for six-month or longer bicycle trips because of how durable they are. <em>Typical weight: 2500-4000g.</em></p>
<h4 id="horses-for-courses">Horses for Courses</h4>
<p>Ok, so there is no <strong>best</strong> tent; different tents are better in certain situations.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you&#8217;ll need to strike a balance between weight (ultralight tents) and durability (4-season tents). With durability also comes better performance in the wind, tougher, more waterproof floors, and additional insulation properties in cooler climates.</p>
<p>High-quality 4-season tents tend to be expensive, twice the pack weight/size of an ultralight equivalent and perform poorly in warmer climates where heavier fabrics (and reduced mesh) limit the tents ability to ventilate well.</p>
<p>In summary, look for a tent that will suit both the climates you intend to travel through, the types of places you will camp and the number of times you&#8217;ll need to use it.</p>
<h4 id="freestanding-vs-tunnel-tents">Freestanding vs Tunnel Tents</h4>
<p><em>A great way to reduce your options is to decide whether you&#8217;re after a tunnel or freestanding tent.</em></p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25035421@N04/11698965473/in/set-72157639258294015" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img  loading="lazy"  id="blogsy-1388630929417.272"  class="aligncenter pk-lazyload"  src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII="  alt="bicycle touring tents"  width="618"  height="425"  data-pk-sizes="auto"  data-pk-src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3779/11698965473_8a882d1a26_z.jpg" ></a></div>
<p><strong>Why should you buy a tunnel tent?<br />
</strong>&#8211; Tunnel tents are undoubtedly better in the wind at any given weight (eg. a 2kg freestanding tent vs 2kg tunnel tent).<br />
&#8211; The vestibules are often large and great for entertaining/cooking under.<br />
&#8211; They&#8217;re easy to set up (especially in the wind).</p>
<p><strong>Why should you NOT buy a tunnel tent?<br />
</strong>&#8211; Tunnel tents rely on being staked out, limiting where you can set them up.<br />
&#8211; They&#8217;re 20-40% longer in length (bigger footprint) than a dome tent for the same inner size, again limiting where you can set them up.<br />
&#8211; Not as good at supporting snow on their roof.<br />
&#8211; They&#8217;re most of the time single entrance.<br />
&#8211; They have a lower, sloping roof; two people sometimes can&#8217;t sit up at once, or at all.<br />
&#8211; Poorer ventilation than most freestanding tents, especially if your gear is stored in the front and rear.</p>
<p><strong>Why should you buy a freestanding tent?<br />
</strong>&#8211; They stand without staking, allowing you to pitch them anywhere.<br />
&#8211; You can easily pitch just the inner.<br />
&#8211; Two entrances is common.<br />
&#8211; They often have great ventilation.<br />
&#8211; You can pick up the tent, move it, shake it out, clean it etc<br />
&#8211; The roof can often withstand snow.<br />
&#8211; They&#8217;re more spacious internally (eg. headroom).</p>
<p><strong>Why should you NOT buy a freestanding tent?<br />
</strong>&#8211; Not as good in the wind as a tunnel tent &#8211; you&#8217;ll need a comparably heavy freestanding tent to do well in adverse conditions.</p>
<p><strong>My take:</strong> I cannot imagine travelling with a tunnel tent because I sleep on many surfaces which will not allow pegging &#8211; such as a concrete pier or basketball court. Heavy objects can be laid out to hold up a tunnel tent, but I prefer to pop up my freestanding tent anywhere without hassle.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25035421@N04/11419010743/in/set-72157638760853186" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img  loading="lazy"  id="blogsy-1388630929336.5032"  class="aligncenter pk-lazyload"  src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII="  alt="bicycle touring tents"  width="1000"  height="665"  data-pk-sizes="auto"  data-pk-src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3676/11419010743_730a1e0f27_z.jpg" ></a></div>
<h4 id="weight">Weight</h4>
<p>Tents suitable for bike touring can be as lights as 800g or as heavy as 4000g. When comparing similarly priced products, the weight of a tent is often a good indicator as to how durable it will be.</p>
<p>Heavier 4-season tents employ more poles (that are reinforced) and thicker materials for the fly and inner. As a result, you will probably find a 4-season tent that lasts longer than an ultralight.</p>
<h4 id="size-1-2-or-3-person">Size (1, 2 or 3-Person?)</h4>
<p>What size tent is best for bicycle touring? It depends on how long you&#8217;re on the road.</p>
<p>On <strong>shorter tours</strong> (less than six weeks), you&#8217;ll be fine with a tent designed for the number of people you&#8217;re travelling with (eg. a solo traveller in a 1-person tent, or a couple in a 2-person tent).</p>
<p>On <strong>longer tours</strong> (more than six weeks) it&#8217;s worth getting a tent with a bit more space (eg. a couple in a 3-person tent). The space is nice; I can even fit all of my bags inside my 3-person tent inner with another person, giving me quick access to everything I carry.</p>
<h4 id="vestibules">Vestibules</h4>

<p>If you will be camping in adverse weather conditions, you may want to consider a tent with large, usable vestibules (or a gear shed). They are great for entertaining, cooking, cleaning or repairing your bike in the rain.</p>
<p>Most freestanding &#8216;dome&#8217; tent vestibules are actually pretty useless when it comes to their space being usable &#8211; tunnel tents with a gear shed are much better. If all you need is to store your bags, dome tents will of course be fine.</p>
<h4 id="floors">Floors</h4>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25035421@N04/11699297373/in/set-72157639258294015" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img  loading="lazy"  id="blogsy-1388630929349.2727"  class="aligncenter pk-lazyload"  src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII="  alt="bicycle touring tents"  width="1000"  height="638"  data-pk-sizes="auto"  data-pk-src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3769/11699297373_58e6dbdc7e.jpg" ></a></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve found that floors are one of the most important features of a tent in wet weather conditions. This is because the pressure applied from your body weight and bags is enough to force groundwater through the floor of most tents with a 5000mm (or less) Waterhead rating.</p>
<p>This is a common problem when you camp on surfaces that don&#8217;t absorb water well (gravel, clay, rock, concrete), as the water tends to run under your tent floor and permeates inside.</p>
<h4 id="ventilation">Ventilation</h4>
<figure style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25035421@N04/9989868066/in/set-72157635992460216" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img  loading="lazy"  id="blogsy-1388630929351.5244"  src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII="  alt="bicycle touring tents"  width="1000"  height="666"  class=" pk-lazyload"  data-pk-sizes="auto"  data-pk-src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7426/9989868066_d5f1de674c_z.jpg" ></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">My Mountain Hardwear Skyledge DP is mostly meshed and is utterly brilliant at ventilating &#8211; great in warmer climates.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In general, ultralight and backpacking tent inners have more mesh, and 4-season tent inners employ more nylon. As a result, lighter weight tents tend to be better in warmer climates.</p>
<p>Some 4-season tents have nylon panels that zip away to expose large areas of mesh, which increases their ventilation and makes them more versatile. If you&#8217;re planning to use your tent in various climates, look out for this feature.</p>
<h4 id="entrances">Entrances</h4>
<p>Depending on who you&#8217;re travelling with, the number of entrances in and out of your tent may be something to consider. It is no doubt less obstructive to have two side doors, where people can enter and exit the tent without climbing over or zipping near somebodies head.</p>
<p>If a tent with two entrances is important to you, you&#8217;ll find mostly freestanding tents with this feature.</p>
<h4 id="clips-straps-guy-ropes">Clips, Straps, Guy Ropes</h4>
<p>The rule here is that simpler is better &#8211; complex clips and straps are just asking for trouble and are almost never field repairable.</p>
<p>Ideally guy ropes should attach at <em>two</em> locations on the tent poles, which dramatically increases the stabilisation of the tent in windy conditions. You&#8217;ll notice that all 4-season tents have this feature, and high end companies such as Hilleberg, have this feature on almost all of their tents.</p>
<h4 id="dry-pitch">Dry Pitch</h4>
<p><span class="v9DHrh4TFfCeALRdNujbmygYnVBaQwlZp2it0k3xz7GEcqP8XSK"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mountain Hardwear Skyledge 3 DP Tent" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RjhcAxDMPik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></span></p>
<p>Some tents are able to be pitched in the rain without getting the inner wet &#8211; such as my Mountain Hardwear Skyledge.</p>
<p>The way it works is that the groundsheet and fly can be pitched together, and the inner is brought in later and clipped to the poles. This has been handy for us from time to time but isn&#8217;t 100% necessary.</p>
<h4 id="colour">Colour</h4>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25035421@N04/11699819976/in/set-72157639258294015" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img  loading="lazy"  id="blogsy-1388630929369.976"  class="aligncenter pk-lazyload"  src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAP+KeNJXAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAAlwSFlzAAAOxAAADsQBlSsOGwAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII="  alt="bicycle touring tents"  width="618"  height="412"  data-pk-sizes="auto"  data-pk-src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5539/11699819976_1cd1a849e0_z.jpg" ></a></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re wild camping like me, you&#8217;ll find that light green or sandy coloured tents are great for a mixture of climates, from desert to forest. Darker green tents are great in thicker wooded areas.</p>
<p>Yellow and red tents do stand out, so only use them if you don&#8217;t need to be discreet.</p>
<h4 id="groundsheets">Groundsheets</h4>
<p>I love tent groundsheets. These thick material sheets keep my tent inner clean, protect the tent floor from sharp objects and are <a title="" href="https://www.cyclingabout.com/use-your-tent-groundsheet-as-a-picnic-rug-on-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great to use as a picnic blanket at lunch time</a>.</p>
<p>When I pitch my tent for days in a row, I also throw a groundsheet over the fly to protect it from the sun&#8217;s harmful UV rays. They are truly multipurpose.</p>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>Pick a bicycle touring tent which best suits your needs.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re camping in warm climates, an ultralight or backpacking tent will be much more comfortable than a 4-season given the liberal use of mesh.</p>
<p>In adverse weather conditions or if you&#8217;re travelling for a long time, a 4-season bicycle touring tent with a gear shed may be beneficial.</p>

Try the MSR Nook, <a title="" href="http://www.vaude.com/en-BE/Products/Gear/Tents/Hogan-UL-Argon-1-2P-green.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vaude Hogan</a>, <a title="" href="https://www.cyclingabout.com/initial-impressions-mountain-hardwear-skyledge-3-dp-tent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mountain Hardwear Skyledge</a> or <a title="" href="http://www.mont.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mont Moondance</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Who is on a three month trip in a cooler climate with a high chance of adverse weather conditions?<br />
</strong>A 4-season freestanding or tunnel tent with a gear shed. Try the <a title="" href="http://www.hilleberg.com/home/products/nallo/nallo3gt.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hilleberg Nallo GT</a> or Vaude Hogan XT.</p>
<p><strong>Who is riding through lots of deserts?<br />
</strong>A 4-season freestanding or 3-season tunnel tent for sure. Deserts are windy! Check out the <a title="" href="http://www.hilleberg.com/home/products/nallo/nallo3gt.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hilleberg Nallo</a> or <a title="" href="http://www.hilleberg.com/home/products/allak/allak.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allak</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Who is on a 12-month plus trip?</strong><br />
<strong>Either:</strong> Invest, invest, invest in a high-end 4-season tent. A <a title="" href="http://www.hilleberg.com/home/products/staika/staika.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hilleberg Staika</a> or <a title="" href="http://www.exped.com/en/product-category/tents/venus-ii-extreme-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exped Venus</a> freestanding tent will cost an arm and leg but you will almost definitely get 1000+ nights out of it.<br />
<strong>Or:</strong> If your trip will take you through predominantly warmer climates, an ultralight or backpacking tent will be cooler, but less durable. You may have to replace it sometime on your journey.
