<h1>Girls: Use a GoGirl to Stay Standing</h1>
<p>Defined with the lovely initialisation &#8216;FUD&#8217;: Female Urination Devices are a funnel-like beauties used precisely as they&#8217;re prescribed &#8211; to aid females in urination while standing. They were originally invented in the early 1900s to allow women to use urinals without the rather hands-on standing technique.</p>
<p>Nowadays, FUDs are colourful handheld devices, either made from medical-grade silicone or plastic designed to make doing &#8216;number one&#8217; an easy, different and squat-free experience. They are being embraced more and more often by women travelling where there are no toilets.</p>
<p>There are a few different brands and styles available: the Little John, the Pee-Zee, the p-Style, the WhizBind and the SheWee. As I haven&#8217;t used any but my little pink GoGirl; this review is only about that one.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-gogirl">What is a GoGirl?</h1>
<p>Basically it is a medical-grade silicone device designed to be held against the body when urinating &#8211; alleviating the need to squat when you go.</p>
<p>It has a splash-guard on one end and a funnel on the other and works using gravity &#8211; so long as you&#8217;ve got it positioned correctly (which is very easy to do!)</p>
<h1 id="when-is-a-gogirl-useful">When is a GoGirl useful?</h1>
<p>There are many times when standing is better than squatting:<br />
&#8211; When the squat toilet is squalid (often!)<br />
&#8211; When the bushes are too bushy or bum-endangering.<br />
&#8211; When there are no secretive areas and there are people around &#8211; with the Go Girl, you can just pretend to be a fellow at a tree, seeing a man about a dog&#8230;<br />
&#8211; When upright public toilets are puke-worthy, and you&#8217;d like to keep yourself as far from the rim as possible.<br />
&#8211; Any time in the great outdoors when you&#8217;d rather not hunt for the perfect place.</p>
<h1 id="how-is-a-gogirl-used">How is a GoGirl used?</h1>
<p>Hold the splash-guard firmly to your vagina using your middlefinger and thumb (as directed on the packaging and in the instructions) make sure you&#8217;ve formed a seal, take aim and &#8220;go&#8221; in as consistent a stream as possible.</p>

<p>Keep it &#8216;attached&#8217; until you&#8217;ve completely finished, remove with a forwards-sliding motion.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re done, store it in a snap-lock bag (to wash later) or wash it immediately with clean water and soap. Dry it and fold it away.</p>

<h1 id="why-is-a-gogirl-good">Why is a GoGirl good?</h1>
<p>The GoGirl (or any FUD) transforms &#8216;the squat&#8217; to &#8216;the stand&#8217; with the use of a funnel. Yes, girls, we need not squat if we don&#8217;t want to &#8211; using this nifty little device, girls can now take a slash along with the rest of the boys.</p>
<p>The GoGirl is reusable, meaning that it&#8217;s available anytime and it&#8217;s not wasteful like the rolls of toilet paper you&#8217;d use traditionally.</p>
<p>The GoGirl also practically alleviates the need for wiping &#8211; it can be stored in a snap-lock bag after use and washed the next time you have access to clean water. No littering is always a bonus.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re sick of squatting, digging or searching for &#8216;peeing nirvana&#8217; then this little pink friend can help you.</p>
<h1 id="why-isnt-a-gogirl-good">Why isn&#8217;t a GoGirl good?</h1>
<p>I found the first time a bit&#8230;intimidating. I really had to &#8216;get in there&#8217; because I wasn&#8217;t used to the hand position. I also found I had to pull down my underpants entirely to feel confident that I wasn&#8217;t going to err&#8230;have spillages.</p>
<p>Because it is quite soft, almost flimsy, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s entirely suited for use while wearing knicks (padded bike shorts). I found the amount of force (and tricky Zoolander-style manoeuvres) needed to remove that tight TIGHT lycra from one&#8217;s body is more of a two-handed job, especially for bib-knicks, meaning there isn&#8217;t really much hand or arm left for the application of the GoGirl. I end up removing items of clothing which kind of defeats the purpose of using the GoGirl in terms of discression.</p>
<h1 id="would-i-recommended-it-for-cycle-touring">Would I recommended it for cycle touring?</h1>
<p><strong>Yes and no: </strong></p>
<p>The GoGirl is an extremely well executed version of the FUD, easy to clean and simple to use once you&#8217;ve practised a few times. It is perfect for use when camping and tramping around, before and after the day of cycling.</p>
<p>However, I would probably go with something a little less soft-shelled if you&#8217;re planning on wearing lycra (which I high recommend, read more about why <a title="" href="https://www.cyclingabout.com/index.php/2011/11/to-lycra-or-not-to-lycra/" target="_blank">HERE</a>) while touring. I would probably go with something that will hold its shape a little better while other forces are at play.</p>
<h1 id="where-can-a-gogirl-be-purchased">Where can a GoGirl be purchased?</h1>
