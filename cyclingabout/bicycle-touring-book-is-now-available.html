<p>After cycling 31,000km through 30+ countries, I had acquired a whole bunch of knowledge about how to do this big crazy thing, and so I felt like people should <strong>KNOW</strong> how they too could do the same. I didn&#8217;t ever plan on writing a book, it kind of just happened.<br />
<span class="text_exposed_show"><br />
At times the project seemed far bigger than I was capable of, but bit-by-bit I stuck to it, starting with words which I expanded and refined until I could justify every single one of them. I then went about teaching myself Adobe InDesign which is a ridiculously complicated layout program for the book&#8217;s design. I watched hours and hours of tutorial videos until I felt confident enough to start playing with my own layout &#8211; my first layouts turned out <strong>VERY</strong> average! Luckily I have rad friends who were able to help me through it. 🙂</span></p>
<p>The photos were one of the hardest things to organise as I have 20,000+ that can qualify for a place in the book. It took me weeks to sort through them all to find the optimal photo for each slot. While I was busy finishing off the book, I was trying to work out how to best sell and market the book. I found a rad company that allows me to take payments from inside my website (which I&#8217;ve secured with SSL certs) and then sends you a link for downloads. Not only did I make an interactive PDF version of the book, but I spent this week giving you access to eReader versions too (mobi and EPUB).</p>
<p>This book owes me a <strong>HUGE</strong> amount of time, but ultimately I am now equipped with heaps of amazing new skills to use in the future. Can’t wait to put them to use!</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing your feedback on the book.</p>
