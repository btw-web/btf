<h1>To Lycra or not to Lycra?</h1>
<p>This is an age-old battle many riders continue to struggle with today.</p>
<p>Ever since lycra shorts with plump, nappy-reminiscent chamois or  &#8220;knicks&#8221; were invented (back in the 1900s in a glorious combination of knitted black wool and a leather chamois) they were hailed as official bike wear. Riders of bikes everywhere have gone through the hardening mental process and preparation to wear them&#8230;and LIKE them.</p>

<p>My friend Tim Clarke told me that I&#8217;d be a cyclist if I wore them. He said the word cyclist like a cussword, as if it was a sin to extend oneself from being a &#8220;rider&#8221;  into the realms of cyclist-hood without a bloody good reason. Needless to say, I have both seen Tim in lycra, have gone there (to lycraland) myself and have recommended the wearing of such hideous attire to others. With aplomb.</p>
<p>The first time I wore lycra it was a leotard, and I was dancing and glancing my way through a gymnastics-style performance for my dance group. Bike riding with lycra is similar to performing in it. When in Lycra there is no room for mistakes to be made &#8211; no where to hide, it&#8217;s all part of the performance: All. On. Show.</p>
<p>The second time I endeavored to wear lycra was to model some knicks for a customer at the bike shop I worked at. They bought two pairs. &#8216;Nuff said.</p>
<p>The third time I thrust my nether-regions into lycra was before setting off to ride around New Zealand as Alleycat with Alex Denham. He &#8220;highly recommend&#8221; I wear some knicks and forced me at gunpoint to purchase two pairs.</p>
<p>Once in NZ, I wore them for the first two days. With underpants. Oooohhhhhhhhhh! Such a BAD idea, with a capital U for uncomfortable. These lycra devils (or black-coloured-spanx-in-disguise) are meant to be worn commando.</p>
<p>It was the second night of the journey and Alex and I were in a tiny little hideaway called Tapu Creek, with our own swimminghole and some new friends to boot. One was a Austrian lass who was traveling with her Canadian man-but-not-boy-friend and upon hearing my quiet, gentle and level-headed (read: loud, frequent and unavoidable) complaints about the discomfort I was experiencing whilst wearing lycra AND undies she professed she&#8217;d made the same rookie and girlie mistake.</p>
<blockquote><p>Take ze underwear off, do not wear together. Wear nuzzing underneath</p></blockquote>
<p>Nuzzing?! Nothing?!<br />
She bemoaned the weirdness of the whole to-go-nude-in-lycra or to-NOT-go-nude-in-lycra conundrum, but assured me that it was not only better but the best feeling she&#8217;d ever had. Well ok, not quite, but it was a firm assurance none the less.</p>
<p>The next morning, free as the proverbial Austrian bird, I set out and felt at once cushioned and supported and pro-cyclist and like I was wearing nothin&#8217; at all, nothin&#8217; at all, nothin&#8217; at all (stupid sexy Flanders) and it was heaven. Heaven!</p>

<p>Needless to say I boycotted any and all (under)pant wearing the rest of the few-week trip!</p>
<p>So, to lycra or not to lyrca you ask?<br />
Lycra. Always lycra.</p>
<p>(Just make sure to get a size that fits you in the REAL world, not in magic imaginary-I-really-am-a-size-zero-world!)</p>
