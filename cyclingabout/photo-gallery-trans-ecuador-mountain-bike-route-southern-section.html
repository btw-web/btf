Sometimes I like to explore cities, other times I prefer to explore small villages or remote areas. Sometimes I read a few books a month, other times I prefer to listen to podcasts or binge-watch YouTube. Variety is the spice of life, amirite?</figcaption></figure>

For five weeks I stared at a pile of folded and snapped metal in the corner of my room. Unlike an accidentally dropped glass, this broken bike is an extension of me – it’s a core part of my identity. My bike is always there to help create the best memories. It’s also my golden ticket to freedom. As long as it looked hopeless, I felt the effects of this hopelessness too. It was a huge weight off my shoulders to see it in a rolling state, and it felt even better again to have the dynamo cabling re-wired, the steerer cut and the frame polished to perfection. My bike has survived and will now thrive as I roll to Ecuador (on one wheel &#x1f602;).</figcaption></figure>

That’s because I’ve now adjusted to the comforts and predictability of city life. For weeks I’ve had good food, a comfortable bed and a fast internet connection, but now it’s time to let all that go. Sure, it’s easier for me to make the first step than most, but trust me, there’s always a hurdle that I have to jump over too. I hope you didn’t think it was just you that needed to break down the comfort barrier — I take a deep breath and do it ALL THE TIME!</figcaption></figure>

How do you spend it? Who do you spend your time with? I think about time regularly because I’m always trying to squeeze the most out my precious moments and opportunities. The best way to use time has got to be living a dynamic life where you try new things, go to new places and meet new people &#8211; it’s always the moments outside your routine that solidify into the best memories. If you’re into adventures, I can recommend scheduling them in at a regular interval &#8211; lock those dates away into your diary! Taking an overnight trip every month with family, friends or by yourself (solo trips are underrated &#x1f917;) will tick a lot of boxes here and result in 120 new memories over a decade!</figcaption></figure>

Delivering!!! I’m actually quite surprised how different it is here to Peru. There seems to be a much bigger middle class, measured by houses that are more refined, very well-kept gardens and people exercising in the parks. The Ecuadorians are more reserved in nature too, a bit more softly spoken and less likely to ask you questions from across the street. Interestingly, people are more interested in where I’m FROM rather than where I’m GOING (it’s normally the other way around). Also, the country must have got a nice discount on barbed wire fencing — every metre of every road is lined with the stuff, making it harder for me to wild camp where I *technically* should not. I don’t think Ecuador was prepared for this giraffes arrival though!</figcaption></figure>

And boy, are they right!! I actually changed the gear ratios on my bike in anticipation for these gnarly gradients. The topography of Ecuador is extra undulating, and the roads definitely don’t follow the contours like Peru.

As a highly privileged human who spends time around people who have so much less wealth and opportunity, my initial feeling is always that of guilt. But over time I’ve realised that perhaps feeling guilty isn’t necessarily justified given it was really just dumb luck that made me who I am. I think, at a minimum, there are a few actions we can take to ethically justify travel. I believe we have an obligation to be interested in the local cultures, customs and people, even if it makes us feel uncomfortable. I think we need to treat local people how we’d like to be treated ourselves. And finally, I don’t think we can complain if one of our western comforts isn’t met. Essentially, it all about being a respectful human. Travelling on a bike typically requires these actions by default, and that’s one of the many reasons why I think bike travel is the ultimate way to see the world. I have overwhelming positive interactions with every person I meet, which seems to be mutually beneficial based on the size of the emanating smiles. To help frame my perspective, let me present the antithesis to my preferred style of travel &#8211; staying exclusively in resorts. What this signals to me is that you’re wanting to enjoy the resources of an ‘exotic’ place without having to confront life in that country. I don’t think I can find an ethical case for this.</figcaption></figure>

My previous jacket had the waterproof membrane separate from the fabric after six years of heavy use. This time I’m testing something ultralight (under 200g/7oz) to see if it can provide anywhere near the same daily use/abuse. The model I ended up with is a North Face Verto Storm. I like the compact size, deep pockets, high collar and hood fit under my helmet. The breathability of the fabric is poor though, but I don’t know any ultralight 2.5-layer jackets that perform well in this regard (apparently the Gore R7 Shakedry is a game changer for €299). I think this is compounded by the fact that the fabric is so shapeable &#8211; it sticks to your skin when wet, unlike heavier-duty fabrics which tend to ‘hang&#8217;. I’ve also noticed I need to wear an extra warmth layer underneath to get the same insulation as my heavier jacket &#8211; possibly making the weight savings negligible. This jacket is discontinued, so if you’re looking for something similar, check out the Montbell Versalite.</figcaption></figure>

My mother recently sent across some Australian souvenirs, so these curious humans ended up with a pretty sweet swag o’ gear! Next time I pass by, I’ll make sure to knock on the door and meet them as adults.</figcaption></figure>

Out of the distance comes a man with two tiny puppies in tow. I offered him some biscuits while he asked the usual &#8216;where are you going’ type questions. The man had a long piercing stare and a really odd way of breathing. It was definitely creepy. Even when we ran out of things to say he stared at me in a really unusual way. I used the puppies as a distraction, giving them 100% of my attention, hoping that he’d get the message that we were done. He then took a step closer, made a strange comment about my legs, touched the material of my shorts and abruptly left. I camped about 1km out of town on the top of a ridge. It was pretty hard to hide in these endless farming fields. I was woken by tapping on my tent. It was the same man as the night before, wearing a traditional poncho and big gumboots, obviously off to work. He opened the fly and again awkwardly stared at me straight through the mesh of the tent. I gave him a brief tour of how I live in my tent and he kept going on about how it must be so cold sleeping inside there. He then came around to the other side of my tent. I opened the zipper so that I wasn’t being totally rude. He squatted right next to me and then started touching my mat, sleeping bag and clothes, exclaiming that I cannot possibly be warm with these items. While I was still in my sleeping bag, he asked if I wear trousers while I sleep, but before I could answer he started digging into my sleeping bag with his hand and took a big grab of my genitals!! He was laughing in a pretty manic way as I pulled his arm away. He then took off, after finally getting what he wanted out of me. Normally you’d feel anger in this situation, but it never came. I instantly felt really sorry for this man who obviously had homosexual tendencies but could never truly be himself in this tiny community. I still don’t really know what to think; I guess I didn’t ever imagine I’d have a farmers hand down my pants. &#x1f937;&#x1f3fb;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;</figcaption></figure>

I’ve been travelling by bike for over a decade, but have been to over 80 countries since 2012, covering more than 100,000km. I started out with month-long tours, but it was always my dream to cross overland from Europe to Australia to experience the slow evolution of people and culture from the western to eastern worlds. I saved up heaps of money and sold everything I owned to ride a tandem bike on this 2.5-year journey with my ex-girlfriend. And it was the best thing I ever did &#8211; I was hooked on the adventure, fascinated by the learning experiences and I revelled in the randomness of nomadic life! Skip forward a few years and I’m still on the road, cycling up to Alaska. While the first big trip was all about understanding the people of the world, this trip is so much more about understanding myself and the natural world. I don’t really know what will happen when I finish this trip&#8230; but can you really cycle across five continents and then not visit the sixth? One thing is for sure: wherever the tailwinds lead me, you’ll be coming too.</figcaption></figure>
