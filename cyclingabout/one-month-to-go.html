<h1>One Month To Go</h1>
<p>One month to go&#8230;</p>
<p>We have reached the official &#8216;one month to go&#8217; milestone &#8211; today, June 9th marks the beginning of the final count down &#8211; we have a mere 30 days to go.</p>
<p>I awake each morning and it really is the first thing that pops into my mind, but I still can&#8217;t quite believe it. If you don&#8217;t know Alleykat intimately, you may not have heard the story of how the trip came to fruition; how it came to be a &#8216;thing&#8217;; how it came to be our reality in 30 days time.</p>
<p>Alex and I have known each other for going on six years now, having worked at BSC together many moons ago. We reunited after only a few fleeting foregatherings in the interum of four years, on a warm stormy evening in October 2010, and decided that actually, we really did quite like each other and proceeded to spend pretty much every night together thereafter (bar a few bike races and differing calendars here and there). Notably, during that fateful night and in many conversations afterwards, Alex talked about gearing up for making real a plan he and a close friend (with previous bike adventures together under their belts) had to tour around the world &#8211; perhaps making a documentary along the way and generally just being awesome together for a generous period of time, years probably.</p>
<p>I remember thinking &#8220;hang on a minute. I know that I&#8217;ve only been together with this Alex chap for a little while but I am completely sure that I don&#8217;t want to be without him&#8230;especially not for years at a time!&#8221; and so I muscled my way in, with a plan to join the pair for three to six months at a time and do some of the filming or help out where I could.</p>

<p>Over the next few months however, the universe had other ideas for Alex&#8217;s friend, and his life took a completely different, but equally as adventurous and life-changing, turn and it conspired that he couldn&#8217;t go. After initially being super sad, Alex was surprisingly chipper about this situation, devastated that his friend couldn&#8217;t come of course, but eager to embark on a different kind of trip altogether.</p>

<p>A trip with me, as it so happens. My reaction was immediate. Yes. I want to go. I&#8217;d already decided, really, upon hearing their wild, wacky, wonderful plans that I was going to be there as often as possible and now I was going to be able to be &#8220;there&#8221; full time!</p>
<p>After this invitation was extended (I think the asking itself was fairly straight forward but the intention set me aglow with excitement and just a little bit of pride &#8211; he wants me to ride around the world with him! I am, somewhat embarrassingly, still this head-over-heals excited at the prospect and am this kind of feet-out-of-place thrilled pretty much any time Alex wants me as a part of something he&#8217;s doing) the trip began to take shape and is now just days away.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still finalising my bike, buying a few last bits and pieces and writing articles until our (read: Alex&#8217;s) eyes pop out of our heads, but essentially we are ready to go. It is now our trip &#8211; I feel like I&#8217;m a going on this Alleykat adventure, not simply joining Alex as he rides around the world. We&#8217;re in this together and I can&#8217;t wait!</p>
