<h1>10 Great Reasons Why You Should Try Bicycle Touring</h1>

<p>After I announced I was to be <a href="https://www.theplanetedit.com/london-to-istanbul-bicycle-diary/">cycling from London to Istanbul</a>, many people in my life looked at me incredulously and asked <em>why?&nbsp;</em>Why would anyone want to do that? Well, for me, it was an alternative way of travel that allowed me to uncover the continent in a different way. Travelling by bicycle is rewarding, eco-friendly, and it forces you to travel slowly and really connect with and uncover the region you&#8217;re cycling through.</p>



<p>I believe that bicycle touring is something that anyone who enjoys both cycling and travelling should experience at least once &#8211; here are 10 reasons why.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best, since you have to sweat up the hills and coast down them. Thus you remember them as they actually are, while in a motor car only a high hill impresses you, and you have no such accurate remembrance of country you have driving through as you gain by riding a bicycle.”&nbsp; – Ernest Hemingway</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="bicycle-touring-forces-you-to-travel-slowly">Bicycle touring forces you to travel slowly</h2>



<p>Quite possibly my favourite thing about bike touring is that it forces you to travel slowly.&nbsp;<em>Really&nbsp;</em>slowly. Most tourists will travel from hotspot to hotspot, but on a bike, you&#8217;ll get to uncover things that others may miss. As Ernest Hemingway once said, &#8220;it is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best,&#8221; and I have to agree. You notice the fine details, you truly immerse yourself into your surroundings, and you meet locals who might not typically see tourists.</p>



<h2 id="bicycle-touring-forces-you-to-live-minimalist-for-a-while">Bicycle touring forces you to live minimalist for a while</h2>



<p>Life on a bike is very simple. You can carry only the essentials. Trust me, that extra pair of shoes or heavy camera gear is not worth it when you&#8217;re climbing hills on a loaded bike. Every evening, I would set up my tent and sit down to cook myself a meal on my camp stove. I was forced to live very simply for a while; I found this to be freeing and it allowed me to appreciate what I had.</p>



<h2 id="it-s-an-eco-friendly-way-to-travel">It&#8217;s an eco-friendly way to travel</h2>



<p>One of the main reasons I wanted to try bicycle touring is because it has little to no impact on the environment. Roughly 15% of carbon emissions come from transport &#8211; such as cars, buses, trains and aeroplanes &#8211; which means that this sector has quite a significant impact on global warming. Thanks to my love of travel, my carbon footprint is a lot higher than I would like. A real positive aspect of bike touring is knowing that your trip has been sustainable and kind to the environment.</p>



<h2 id="the-bicycle-touring-community-is-incredible">The bicycle touring community is incredible</h2>



<p>If you opt for a tour along a popular bicycle route, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll meet a ton of other bicycle tourists. Cyclists love to speak with other cyclists; it&#8217;s like they already know you have something in common and are therefore someone they can strike up a conversation with. Many of the campsites along <a href="https://www.theplanetedit.com/cycling-eurovelo-6-guide/" data-type="post" data-id="6776">EuroVelo 6</a> were dominated by bike tourists, and I was often invited to join people for dinner or have a chat. It felt like being a part of something.</p>

<h2 id="you-ve-got-total-freedom">You&#8217;ve got total freedom</h2>



<p>One of my favourite things to do while cycling was to find a nice spot by the river and sit to make myself a coffee. Your <a href="https://www.theplanetedit.com/bike-touring-gear-guide/" data-type="post" data-id="12180">bike can carry all your luggage</a> &#8211; your tent, your cooking equipment and your clothes. This means everything you need is packed onto your bike and you can simply go where the road takes you. You&#8217;ll always have shelter and the means to prepare food, so you&#8217;re not confined to hotel bookings, bus schedules or the availability of restaurants. You have the freedom to decide everything.</p>



<h2 id="bicycle-touring-is-very-cost-effective">Bicycle touring is very cost-effective</h2>



<p>One of the biggest expenses involved in travel is transport costs. Well, thanks to your bike, you have no transport costs. And, given that your bike can carry camping and cooking equipment, your food and accommodation costs are going to be very low, too. Many bicycle tourists even choose to wild camp, meaning that accommodation costs are zero.</p>



<h2 id="cycling-is-fun">Cycling is fun</h2>



<p>While cycling is a method of transportation, let&#8217;s not ignore the fact that it&#8217;s downright <em>fun.&nbsp;</em>Pedalling along the river and through poppy-ridden meadows on a sunny day provides serenity, whereas hurtling down mountain passes with the wind ruffling your hair provides some adrenaline-fuelled fun.</p>



<h2 id="get-out-into-nature-and-enjoy-some-you-time">Get out into nature and enjoy some&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>time</h2>



<p>Bicycle touring means you&#8217;ll be out on your bike for most of the day. Maybe you&#8217;ll find yourself cycling through forests and meadows, or along rivers and coastlines. Either way, you&#8217;ll get to immerse yourself in nature and enjoy a lot of fresh air and beautiful sights. I found that cycling solo through beautiful scenery gave me a lot of time to <em>think</em> and enjoy some time to myself. It actually helped me come to terms with some problems from my past and accept old mistakes. Or perhaps you&#8217;ll choose to invite a companion on your bicycle tour, which means you can spend some quality time together.</p>

<h2 id="accomplish-something-physically-and-mentally-challenging">Accomplish something physically and mentally challenging</h2>



<p>Obviously, cycling is a form of exercise, and a bike tour means you&#8217;ll get fitter while you travel. But it&#8217;s not just your physical fitness that will improve thanks to bicycle touring. Having to navigate yourself through a region and be totally self-sufficient can provide you with newfound feelings of independence and confidence. Not only this, scaling hills and tricky terrain can teach you to overcome the hurdles of &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m not strong enough.&#8221; Because you <em>are&nbsp;</em>strong enough.</p>



<h2 id="try-something-new">Try something new</h2>



<p>Trying new things is a huge part of travel for me. It allows me to challenge my way of thinking, discover different approaches to things and learn about new ideas. I also like to be pushed outside of my comfort zone. Bicycle touring was definitely something new for me, and it turned out to be one of the most refreshing, rewarding travel experiences of my life.</p>
