<h1>The Best Budget Touring Bikes In 2022 (Under £1000)</h1>

<p>Are you looking to buy a new touring bike that won&#8217;t break the bank? You&#8217;re in the right place, as this article will showcase some of the best budget touring bikes available to buy in 2022, as well as some tips on bagging a cheap bike.</p>



<p>Lots of people seem to think that you need super high-quality equipment for a cycle touring trip, especially when it comes to the bike itself. And while you do generally get what you pay for, you really don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to fork out £2000+ on a premium bike. </p>



<p>The best budget touring bikes are still ready for the open road and capable of carrying you from A to B, but will have more basic components (e.g. an aluminium frame over a steel frame or rim brakes instead of disc brakes) to save on costs. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="723" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ridgeback-Tour-e1637251009247.jpg" alt="Best budget touring bikes" class="wp-image-15316"/><figcaption>The Ridgeback Tour is a great example of a budget touring bike with its aluminium frame and rim brake setup — more on this below!</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="choosing-a-bike-for-touring-with-a-low-budget">Choosing a bike for touring with a low budget</h2>



<p>The reality is this: touring bikes are <strong>expensive </strong>items. They&#8217;re designed to be durable and capable of hauling heavy luggage, while still being efficient and comfortable to ride all day. These are features that cost. But unless you&#8217;re planning to embark on a lengthy round-the-world tour, you really don&#8217;t need to buy the world&#8217;s best touring bike. </p>



<p>In fact, you don&#8217;t necessarily even need a <em>touring</em> bike. Although touring bikes are (obviously) specifically designed for this purpose, <strong>most bicycles can be adapted</strong> to make them suitable for touring. Hybrids and gravel bikes, in particular, can be good options. A bike with the following characteristics would be suitable:</p>



<ul><li>Durable</li><li>Comfortable riding position</li><li>Low gears for climbing hills</li><li>Fitment points to add racks etc</li><li>The ability to run wide tyres (ideally 32mm or more)</li></ul>



<p>So while non-touring bikes may not be primarily <em>designed</em> to provide comfort or carrying capability over long distances, they can still transport you and your <a href="https://www.theplanetedit.com/best-panniers-for-touring/">panniers</a> from A to B. My <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/bikes/hybrid-bikes/fitness-bikes/fx/7-2-fx/p/16462/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trek 7.2 FX hybrid</a> happily takes me touring in Europe, for example.</p>



<p>What I&#8217;m saying is this: if you have a low budget, please don&#8217;t let this stop you from touring. People have cycled epic distances on bikes that didn&#8217;t look up to the job. </p>

<h2 id="touring-bikes">The best budget touring bikes</h2>



<p>Here are the best budget touring bikes currently on the market. Not all of these bikes are specifically <em>touring </em>bikes — there are a couple of hybrids and a gravel bike thrown in the mix — but they all have features that make them suitable for touring.</p>



<h3 id="giant-roam-2-disc-679">Giant Roam 2 Disc (£679)</h3>



<p><strong><em>A versatile hybrid bike, totally capable of touring.</em></strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.giant-bicycles.com/gb/roam-2-disc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Giant Roam 2 Disc</a> has everything you&#8217;d expect from a great hybrid bike. It&#8217;s got a suspension fork, grippy tyres and flat-bar positioning for comfort and control over rough surfaces. It&#8217;s also got wide-range gearing, 700c wheels and a lightweight aluminium frame, so efficiency and speed aren&#8217;t sacrificed. All in all, the Roam 2 is built for versatility.</p>



<p>The Roam 2 does have a few mounting points, but doesn&#8217;t come with any accessories for touring, so you&#8217;ll need to factor racks and bottle cages etc into your budget. </p>



<p><strong>Frame:&nbsp;</strong>Aluminium<br><strong>Wheel size:&nbsp;</strong>700c<br><strong>Tyres:&nbsp;</strong>Giant CrossCut, 700x42c, anti-puncture<br><strong>Brakes:&nbsp;</strong>Tektro HD-M275 Hydraulic Disc<br><strong>Gearing:&nbsp;</strong>30-46T chainset, 11-36T cassette<br><strong>Accessories:</strong> None</p>

<h3 id="the-best-budget-touring-bikes">Riverside Touring 520 (£799.99)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="605" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/riverside-touring-520-bike.jpg" alt="Riverside Touring 520" class="wp-image-81505"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>Designed with European greenways and bike paths in mind.</em></strong></p>



<p>You&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to find a bike brand that beats Decathlon on price. This is primarily due to the fact that they have their own in-house bike brands (such as B&#8217;Twin) and so cut out the middle man when it comes to parts. It&#8217;s no surprise, then, that their <a href="https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/touring-bike-riverside-touring-520/_/R-p-332407?mc=8643286&amp;c=BLUE_TURQUOISE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riverside Touring 520</a> was the cheapest touring bike I could find, and while I was dubious as to its quality, online reviews seem to have nothing but praise.</p>



<p>Riverside (Decathlon) say: &#8220;Our touring team has designed this bike for discovering bike touring on greenways and bike paths.&#8221; Essentially, it would make a great euro-tourer but probably wouldn&#8217;t be reliable on a years-long round-the-world voyage. That being said, I&#8217;m impressed by the powerful hydraulic disc brakes and 11-speed cassette. It even comes with a front dynamo hub to power your lights.</p>



<p><strong>Frame:&nbsp;</strong>Aluminium<br><strong>Wheel size:&nbsp;</strong>700c<br><strong>Tyres:&nbsp;</strong>B&#8217;Twin Trekking 9 Grip Protect+ tyres<br><strong>Brakes:</strong>&nbsp;Tektro T275 Hydraulic Disc Brakes<br><strong>Gearing:&nbsp;</strong>11-46T 11-speed cassette<br><strong>Accessories:&nbsp;</strong>Rear rack, mudguards, dynamo hub</p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;→</strong> Buy the Riverside Touring 520 from <a href="https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/touring-bike-riverside-touring-520/_/R-p-332407?mc=8643286&amp;c=BLUE_TURQUOISE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decathlon.</a></p>



<h3 id="the-best-budget-touring-bikes">Fuji Touring LTD 2021 (£800)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="736" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/fuji-touring-ltd.jpg" alt="Fuji Touring Ltd Bike" class="wp-image-81453"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>A packrat of a bicycle, ideal for heavily-loaded tours.</em></strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/fuji-touring-ltd-road-bike-2021/rp-prod201710" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fuji Touring LTD</a> was designed to be a packrat of a bicycle — ideal for long tours that will require a fair amount of luggage. It comes with a rear rack, and also has plenty of mounting points for adding additional racks, bags and bottle cages as needed.</p>



<p>Thanks to its flat bar design, the Fuji Touring is great for riding over rougher terrain with control and stability. This means it&#8217;s better suited for off-road detours than many of the &#8220;classic&#8221; touring bikes out there, which typically use drop bars instead. The Fuji Touring also rolls upon durable Vittoria Randonneur tyres, enabling fast rolling speeds with dependable grip and traction.</p>



<p><strong>Frame:&nbsp;</strong>Reynolds 520 Chromoly<br><strong>Wheel size:&nbsp;</strong>700c<br><strong>Tyres:&nbsp;</strong>Vittoria Randonneur 700 x 40c<br><strong>Brakes:</strong>&nbsp;Shimano Alivio Rim Brakes<br><strong>Gearing:&nbsp;</strong>48-36-26T chainset, 11-34T 9-speed cassette<br><strong>Accessories:&nbsp;</strong>Rear rack and mudguards</p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;→</strong> Buy the Fuji Touring LTD from <a href="https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/fuji-touring-ltd-road-bike-2021/rp-prod201710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chain Reaction Cycles</a> or <a href="https://www.wiggle.co.uk/fuji-touring-ltd-bike-2021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wiggle.</a></p>



<h3 id="the-best-budget-touring-bikes">Cube Touring Pro 2022 (£849)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cube-touring-pro.jpg" alt="Cube Touring Pro" class="wp-image-15287"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>Touring meets hybrid &#8211; this bike is the best of both worlds.</em></strong></p>



<p>Fully equipped with a rear rack, taillights and mudguards, the <a href="https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Cube-Touring-Pro-2022-Touring-Bike_242581.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cube Touring Pro</a> is ready for adventure straight out of the box.</p>



<p>This bike is a hybrid at heart, rather than a true touring bike, but take it from me: hybrids can be great for touring. The Cube Touring Pro handles gravel paths with ease, thanks to its plush suspension fork and grippy Schwalbe Range Cruiser tyres. While it may be slower than a typical touring bike, it’ll keep you comfortable over those bumpier roads.</p>



<p><strong>Frame:&nbsp;</strong>Aluminium<br><strong>Wheel size:&nbsp;</strong>700c<br><strong>Tyres:&nbsp;</strong>Schwalbe Range Cruiser, Active, 47-622<br><strong>Brakes:</strong>&nbsp;Shimano BR-MT200 Hydraulic Disc<br><strong>Gearing:&nbsp;</strong>48-36-26T chainset, 12-32T cassette<br><strong>Accessories:&nbsp;</strong>Rear rack, mudguards, taillights and kickstand</p>

<h3 id="the-best-budget-touring-bikes">Ridgeback Tour 2021 (£850)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="723" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ridgeback-Tour-e1637251009247.jpg" alt="Ridgeback Tour" class="wp-image-15316"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>A classic-style touring bike for adventure on a budget. </em></strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://welovecycles.com/product/ridgeback-tour-teal-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ridgeback Tour</a> is a great example of a &#8220;classic&#8221; touring bike, with its long wheelbase, drop bar set up and numerous fitment points. It has a lot in common with its dearer cousin the <a href="https://www.ridgeback.co.uk/ridgeback-panorama-varrb22530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ridgeback Panorama</a>, but with cost-saving components, such as an aluminium frame, rim brakes, and a basic but reliable drivetrain.</p>



<p>The Tour may be the cheapest of Ridgeback’s touring bike range, but it’s still ready for the open road, as its equipped with full-length mudguards and a rear pannier rack. Since&nbsp;Dawes discontinued the much-loved Galaxy&nbsp;in 2020, there’s been a gap in the market for a great entry-level touring bike, which the Ridgeback Tour might just fill.</p>



<p><strong>Frame:&nbsp;</strong>Aluminium<br><strong>Wheel size:&nbsp;</strong>700c<br><strong>Tyres:&nbsp;</strong>Continental Contact 700x32c<br><strong>Brakes:&nbsp;</strong>Tektro CR-510 Rim Brakes<br><strong>Gearing:&nbsp;</strong>48-38-28T chainset, 11-32T cassette<br><strong>Accessories:&nbsp;</strong>Rear rack and mudguards</p>



<p><strong>→&nbsp;</strong>Buy the Ridgeback Tour 2021 from&nbsp;<a href="https://welovecycles.com/product/ridgeback-tour-teal-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We Love Cycles.</a></p>



<h3 id="the-best-budget-touring-bikes">Genesis Day One (£899.99)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="801" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/genesis-day-one-bike.jpg" alt="Genesis Day One Bike" class="wp-image-81739"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>Touring bike meets gravel bike.</em></strong></p>



<p>Genesis are a UK bike brand renowned for their great value models and the <a href="https://www.freewheel.co.uk/genesis-day-one-vargn21230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Day One</a> is no different. &#8220;Super-commuter, meets touring, meets gravel bike, the Day One is our triple threat!&#8221; say Genesis. Decked out with an abundance of mounting points for racks, bags, cages and more, this bike is designed to take you and your gear as far as your legs will carry you. </p>



<p>Interestingly, the Genesis Day One is equipped with an internal gear hub, rather than derailleur gears. This might be either a positive or a negative, depending on your preference, but I personally think it&#8217;s a positive. Internal gear hubs require much less maintenance, are generally more reliable and allow you to change gear while stationary. </p>



<p><strong>Frame:&nbsp;</strong>Double-Butted Aluminium<br><strong>Wheel size:&nbsp;</strong>700c<br><strong>Tyres:&nbsp;</strong>WTB All Terrain<br><strong>Brakes:&nbsp;</strong>PROMAX DSK-300 Road Mechanical Disc<br><strong>Gearing:&nbsp;</strong>Shimano Nexus SG-C6001-8D 8-speed internal gear hub<br><strong>Accessories:</strong> None</p>

<h3 id="gravel-bikes">Trek FX 3 Equipped (£975)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="746" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/trek-fx-3-equipped-bike.jpg" alt="Trek FX 3 Equipped Bike" class="wp-image-81502"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>A fully-equipped bike from the world&#8217;s most popular hybrid series.</em></strong></p>



<p>Trek&#8217;s FX series is the most popular hybrid line in the world — clearly, they have a great track record. While there are a few different models in the FX series, the <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/bikes/hybrid-bikes/fitness-bikes/fx/fx-3-disc-equipped/p/35107/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FX 3 Equipped</a> is a particularly great option for touring. </p>



<p>As the name would suggest, it&#8217;s very well-equipped and ready for adventure straight out of the box. It comes with a rear rack, mudguards and taillights as standard, as well as powerful disc brakes, puncture-resistant tyres and a wide-range 11-36 cassette to get you up those hills.</p>



<p>The FX 3 Equipped does come in at just under £1000 and so may be stretching the limits of a &#8220;budget touring bike,&#8221; but there are cheaper models in the FX line that could also be good options.</p>



<p><strong>Frame:&nbsp;</strong>Aluminium<br><strong>Wheel size:&nbsp;</strong>700c<br><strong>Tyres:&nbsp;</strong>Bontrager H2 Hard-Case Lite<br><strong>Brakes:&nbsp;</strong>Shimano MT201 Hydraulic Disc<br><strong>Gearing:&nbsp;</strong>46-30T chainset, 11-36T 9-speed cassette<br><strong>Accessories:</strong> Rear rack, mudguards, kickstand</p>

<h3 id="gravel-bikes">Marin Four Corners 2021 (£995)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="796" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/marin-four-corners-bike.jpg" alt="Marin Four Corners Gravel Bike" class="wp-image-81501"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>A comfortable gravel bike designed with touring in mind.</em></strong></p>



<p><a href="https://winstanleysbikes.co.uk/marin-four-corners-2021-bike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marin&#8217;s Four Corners</a> is just squeezing into this best budget touring bikes list at £995. It&#8217;s primarily a gravel bike, but is designed with touring in mind, which is why it&#8217;s featured here. It has an abundance of mounting points for racks etc, tons of heel clearance, and a heads-up riding position for comfort over long days in the saddle. </p>



<p>The Four Corners is certainly built for adventure and is happiest touring a little off-the-beaten-path, whether that&#8217;s a dirt road, gravel path or forest track. At almost 13kg, it&#8217;s a little sluggish uphill and certainly won&#8217;t break any records for speed, but it&#8217;ll make a versatile and comfortable touring companion. Touring is all about the marathon and not the sprint, after all.</p>



<p><strong>Frame:&nbsp;</strong>CroMo/Steel<br><strong>Wheel size:&nbsp;</strong>650b on XS and S frame sizes, 700c on the rest<br><strong>Tyres:&nbsp;</strong>WTB Resolute<br><strong>Brakes:&nbsp;</strong>Tektro Spyre-C Road Mechanical Disc<br><strong>Gearing:</strong> 50-39-30T chainset, 11-34T 9-speed cassette<br><strong>Accessories:</strong> None</p>

<h2 id="choosing-a-bike-for-touring-with-a-low-budget">Quick tips on bagging a cheap touring bike</h2>



<p><strong>Buy second-hand: </strong>You may be able to get a really great deal by buying a used bike. eBay and Gumtree are good places to look. Searching &#8220;touring bikes&#8221; on eBay just now, it&#8217;s come up with a Ridgeback World Tour for £350, a Dawes Galaxy for £300 and a custom-built Thorn for £580.</p>



<p><strong>Buy at the end of the year: </strong>Towards the end of the calendar year, many bike brands will start rolling out next year&#8217;s models. A complete frame redesign takes a lot of time and investment and can’t be done every year. So when a brand launches its next bike, it will usually just be a new colour scheme and a few minor changes — essentially the same bike, but now at a higher price. They will need to clear stock to make way for these new models, so you can often grab last year&#8217;s model at a discount during this time.</p>



<p><strong>Upgrade later: </strong>The nice thing about bikes is that they can be modified and upgraded. As long as you choose a bike with a decent frame now, you can upgrade sub-par components over time. This means you won&#8217;t be taking such a financial hit in one go.</p>
