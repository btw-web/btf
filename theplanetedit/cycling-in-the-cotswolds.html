<h1>Cycling In The Cotswolds: Rolling Countryside &amp; Honey-Hued Villages</h1>

<p>Cycling is a great way to explore the historic villages and rolling landscapes of the Cotswold Hills, Britain’s largest Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It&#8217;s super easy to get about by bike, with many country lanes and quiet B roads criss-crossing the area.</p>



<p>I recently spent 4 days cycling in the Cotswolds. I based myself in the charming market town of Moreton-in-Marsh, one of the most popular locations in the northern Cotswolds. It&#8217;s set on the crossroads of the ancient Fosse Way Roman road, making it the perfect base from which to explore the area.</p>



<p>I spent my 4 days cycling through the quaint villages and rolling green fields of what must be one of the most quintessentially English places in England. Although most of my routes included a few tough climbs, I was rewarded with stunning views wherever I went. The climbs provided the perfect excuse to indulge in copious guilt-free tearoom goodies and pub lunches along the way &#8211; of which there were many!</p>

<p>On my first day of cycling in the Cotswolds, I headed out to explore to the west of Moreton-in-Marsh. There were some small climbs into Batsford and Draycott, before a ride down scenic Fish Hill and into Broadway. There was a path alongside the road all the way down Fish Hill, so I thankfully didn&#8217;t have to join the traffic beside me.</p>



<p>My first stop was Broadway Tower, one of the Cotswolds&#8217; most iconic landmarks. The entrance fee was £12, which I thought was a tad expensive and so chose not to go up to the tower itself, but I did do the short walk around it. The Broadway Tower Walk follows a small stretch of the 100-mile Cotswold Way, showcasing magical views across the Severn Valley.</p>



<p>Back on the bike, there was then a long climb up to Snowshill. It was a challenging ascent, and I&#8217;ll admit that my thighs gave out before I reached the top. The climb was worth it, though, as I was treated to epic views from the top. Apparently, you can see all the way across to Wales on a clear day!</p>



<p>After I&#8217;d gotten my breath back, I was able to enjoy a freewheeling 7-mile descent along picturesque tree-lined roads into the charming village of Guiting Power. I stopped here for a coffee, before continuing onto Bourton-on-the-Hill and back to Moreton-in-Marsh.</p>



<h2>Day 2: Chipping Campden and Stratford-upon-Avon</h2>

<p>The first destination of the day was the picture-perfect Chipping Campden, renowned to be one of the most beautiful towns in the UK. The honey-hued limestone buildings were delightful to see and I couldn&#8217;t resist stopping for a cream tea at the adorable <em><a href="https://bantamtea-rooms.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bantam Tea Rooms.</a></em></p>



<p>Today&#8217;s mission, though, was to visit Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare. </p>



<p>Once I arrived in the village of Long Marston, I was able to join a Greenway that continued all the way into Stratford-Upon-Avon. The Greenway is a traffic-free and well-surfaced path excellent for cyclists, so I was able to pick up the pace and arrived at Stratford-upon-Avon in no time.</p>



<p>Once there, I enjoyed a picnic on the banks of the River Avon, before heading off to visit Shakespeare&#8217;s childhood home. It was strange to see a modern high street interrupted by such a relic &#8211; the old home looked out of place amongst the shops and ice-cream stalls, but it was very interesting to see.</p>



<p>After I&#8217;d wandered around Stratford-upon-Avon for a couple of hours, I headed back to Moreton-in-Marsh the same way I came.</p>



<h2>Day 3: Bourton-on-the-Water, The Slaughters and Stow-on-the-Wold</h2>

<p>Set on the tranquil River Windrush, historic Bourton-on-the-Water is often voted as one of the prettiest villages in England. After I spent some time enjoying the scenery here and had eaten lunch by the water, I followed the River Eye north to the twin villages of Lower Slaughter and Upper Slaughter (collectively known as &#8216;The Slaughters&#8217;). The Slaughters were quintessentially English, characterised by rows of pretty cottages lining the river. </p>



<p>From The Slaughters, I continued on to Stow-on-the-Wold, a bustling town with lots of places to eat and drink. The climb into Stow-on-the-Wold was quite tough, so I stopped for a coffee break on the high street at the charming <em>Lucy&#8217;s Tearoom.</em></p>



<p>From Stow-on-the-Wold, I followed the designated cycle route back to Moreton-in-Marsh, via Broadwell and Evenlode. The route took me through a scenic forested area and the Evenlode Valley, where you could see for miles across the rolling countryside. </p>



<p>It was late afternoon by the time I was following Evenlode Road back to Moreton-in-Marsh, and the sun was just beginning to set. There’s something about the way the late afternoon sun hits the Cotswolds’ honey-coloured cottages that just has to be witnessed. It is utterly, utterly wonderful.</p>

<p>I woke up to rain today, so put on my raincoat and set off, hoping the showers would soon pass. </p>



<p>From Moreton-in-Marsh, the route took me north-east via quiet country lanes to Shipston-on-Stour. As I arrived, the rain became very heavy, so I decided to have a second breakfast at a pub called <em>The George Townhouse</em>. I stayed here for a while, before accepting that I would simply be cycling in the rain today.</p>



<p>I cycled east to Upper Brailes, up to Winderton and into Lower Brailes. It was a fairly hilly ride with frequent undulations, but the patchwork fields and small villages were beautiful, even in the rain.</p>



<p>The skies cleared a little during the second half of the day &#8211; much to be my delight &#8211; and I followed the route along many more scenic lanes and over the River Stour. I rode through lots of villages over the course of the afternoon, including Whichford, Stourton, Cherington, Little Wolford and Great Wolford. Seriously, the Cotswolds knows how to do pretty villages! </p>



<p>Many lanes, many fields, and many, many sheep kept me company on the lanes back towards Moreton-in-Marsh.</p>
