<h1>The 8 Best Panniers and Bike Bags For Touring in 2022</h1>

<p>Looking to find out which are the best panniers for touring in 2022? You’re in the right place.</p>



<p>Panniers are designed to store all of your <a href="https://www.theplanetedit.com/bike-touring-gear-guide/" data-type="post" data-id="12180">gear</a> and be hung off the sides of your bicycle. They&#8217;ve been the luggage system of choice for cycle tourists for over a century, enabling us to cover great distances completely self-supported.</p>



<p>A lot of the cheap panniers out there (costing less than about £50) are typically designed for commuting or transporting groceries. They&#8217;re often not waterproof or particularly durable so don&#8217;t really make good options for touring, where they&#8217;re likely to get rained on and take a bit of a beating. When it comes to panniers, you usually get what you pay for.</p>



<p>In this guide to the best panniers for touring, I&#8217;ve listed 8 of the most popular and best-loved options, with information on what makes them great for touring, their carrying capacity, weight, price and more. </p>



<h2 id="the-best-panniers-for-touring">What makes a good touring pannier?</h2>



<p>In my opinion, the most important features touring panniers need to have is <strong>waterproofness</strong> and <strong>durability.</strong> It&#8217;s highly likely that you&#8217;ll encounter rain at some point, and you want to make sure that all your gear is protected inside. Likewise, your panniers will probably receive a fair amount of use, so need to be durable and hard-wearing.</p>



<p>Other important qualities to look for in touring panniers include:</p>



<ul><li>A well-made mounting system (the clips etc that attach the pannier to the bike rack)</li><li>Quick and easy to take on and off the bike</li><li>A hard back to protect contents</li><li>A proven track record</li><li>Good value for money</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="685" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/best-panniers-for-touring.jpg" alt="Best panniers for touring" class="wp-image-81445"/><figcaption>Arkel&#8217;s Orca 45 Panniers are a fantastic option &#8211; more on these below!</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="the-best-panniers-for-touring">Are Ortliebs the best panniers for touring?</h2>



<p>If you know anything about cycle touring then you&#8217;ve most likely heard of <a href="https://www.ortlieb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ortlieb</a>. They are by far the best-known and most popular pannier brand out there. I&#8217;ve personally met countless cycle tourists rocking Ortliebs. This is probably because they tick all the boxes: completely waterproof, very durable and high quality.</p>



<p>I asked in a cycle touring Facebook group which brand of panniers people recommend, and of the 39 replies I received, 26 of them were Ortlieb. Arkel came in second with 10 votes, Crosso with 2 votes and VAUDE with 1 vote. As you can see, Ortlieb is the reigning prom queen here.</p>



<p>While you can&#8217;t go wrong with Ortliebs, they are not the only pannier brand on the market and there are some (arguably) better value options out there. So if you&#8217;re looking for cheaper options, dislike some of Ortlieb&#8217;s features, or simply want to shop around, then keep reading!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the lowdown on the best panniers for touring. Please note that any mention of size, weight or price pertains to <strong><em>two </em>panniers</strong> (i.e. a pair of panniers).</p>



<h3 id="the-best-panniers-for-touring">Ortlieb Back-Roller Classic (£135)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ortlieb-back-roller-classic-panniers.jpg" alt="Ortlieb Back-Roller Classic Panniers" class="wp-image-81447" width="692" height="692"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>The classic choice for touring panniers.</em></strong></p>



<p>The Ortlieb Back-Roller Classic Panniers are a staple among the cycling world, and it&#8217;s not hard to see why. They truly set the standard for touring panniers with their waterproof material, toughness, roll-top closure and secure mounting system. These panniers also include several thoughtful extras such as organizing pockets for smaller items, reflective patches for extra visibility and a shoulder strap for if you need to carry it about while off the bike.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for some super reliable, functional and resilient panniers, then you really can&#8217;t go wrong with the Back-Roller Classics. I also think they look very nice; sleek and simple.</p>



<p><strong>Size:</strong> 40L | <strong>Weight: </strong>1.9kg</p>

<h3 id="rockbros-bike-panniers">Arkel Orca 45 Panniers (£165.08)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/arkel-orca-45-panniers.jpg" alt="Arkel Orca 45 Panniers" class="wp-image-81444" width="612" height="612"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>Super high-quality panniers renowned for being &#8220;bombproof&#8221;.</em></strong></p>



<p>The Arkel Orca 45s are a great example of high-quality panniers; they hold a good amount of gear, are waterproof, and the rugged material is tough and durable. They receive a lot of praise in the cycle touring community for being &#8220;bombproof&#8221; and reliable.</p>



<p>Arkel pride themselves on having &#8220;a mounting system you can count on&#8221; as they have no plastic attachment parts. The clips and mounting system — which are often the first to go on a poor quality pannier — are super tough and unlikely to break. Arkel may be one of the most expensive pannier brands on the market, but they&#8217;re worth the investment, as they produce really great bike bags that will last for years.</p>

<h3 id="the-best-panniers-for-touring">VAUDE Aqua Rear Panniers (£70)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vaude-aqua-panniers.jpg" alt="Vaude Aqua Panniers" class="wp-image-81493" width="541" height="703"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>Eco-friendly, classic-style touring panniers.</em></strong></p>



<p>The VAUDE Aquas have a lot in common with the Ortlieb Back-Roller Classics. Waterproof and durable with a roll-up closure, inside pockets, reflective patches and a shoulder strap, they definitely know what features cycle tourists want from a good pannier.</p>



<p>They are, however, slightly larger than the Back-Roller Classics while being practically the same weight, making them arguably better value for money. The Aquas also have a rigid plastic plate attached to the outside, which forces the panniers to hold their form and protect the contents, which is great if you&#8217;re carrying a laptop or other breakable items.</p>



<p>VAUDE also have a strong <a href="https://www.vaude.com/en-INT/Equipment/Bike-Bags/?p=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainability ethos</a>: the Aqua Panniers are PVC and PFC free, and all carbon emissions released during manufacturing and shipping are offset. </p>

<h3 id="rockbros-bike-panniers">Carradice Super C Panniers (£130)</h3>



<p><strong><em>Old school, reliable, expedition-style Cotton Duck panniers.</em></strong></p>



<p>Carradice have long been associated with their super tough, old school Cotton Duck panniers. This fabric is totally waterproof but breathable, making it a great choice for cycle touring panniers. The Super Cs have truly stood the test of time, and as Carradice say themselves: &#8220;they have a long pedigree as expedition panniers and have been tested and refined after exposure in the harshest environments around the world.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rather than using the classic roll-up closing system, the panniers are closed with a drawstring and then covered with a deep lid. I really like that these panniers have an external zipped side pocket for organisation.</p>

<h3 id="rockbros-bike-panniers">Thule Shield Panniers (£129.99)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/thule-shield-25l-panniers.jpg" alt="Thule Shield 25L Panniers" class="wp-image-81555" width="468" height="527"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>Super waterproof and durable</em> </strong><em><strong>with interior pockets for organization.</strong></em></p>



<p>Swedish brand Thule are renowned for their good quality outdoor gear, and their Shield Panniers are no exception. They&#8217;ve got 3 interior pockets, making it that little bit easier to keep small items organised. They&#8217;ve also got a removable shoulder strap in case you need to carry the pannier around.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why the Thule Shields are one of the best panniers for touring as they&#8217;re one of the most durable and weatherproof of the models in this list. They&#8217;re also easy to take on and off the bike, use the classic roll-up closing system, and have a simple, sleek design.</p>

<h3 id="rockbros-bike-panniers">Burley Panniers Set (£85.99)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="756" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/burley-panniers.jpg" alt="Burley Panniers Set" class="wp-image-81534"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>Small stuff-sack style panniers for ultralight cycle touring</em></strong>.</p>



<p>Totally waterproof, highly durable and relatively inexpensive, the Burley Panniers Set is a great value deal. They have a small capacity (22L) compared to the other pannier options in this list, but are a good choice for ultralight cycle tourists or for those who prefer to stay in hotels and forgo camping gear. The panniers are roll-top closure and come in a bright yellow colour for visibility. </p>



<p>There are not really any organising compartments inside the Burley Panniers; they are stuff-sack style with one large roll-top compartment only. But for a pair of panniers with just 22L of combined capacity, this makes total sense, as organising compartments reduce the total useable space. </p>



<p><strong>Size:</strong> 22L | <strong>Weight: </strong>0.95kg</p>

<h3 id="rockbros-bike-panniers">Crosso Dry Panniers (£69.99)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/crosso-dry-panniers.jpg" alt="Crosso Dry Panniers" class="wp-image-81446" width="745" height="582"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>Budget touring panniers with a huge 60L of capacity.</em></strong></p>



<p>Crosso are a Polish brand that have been making panniers for well over a decade. Their Dry Panniers are a good option for a budget purchase, as they&#8217;re considerably cheaper than the big name brands, but will still last for years.</p>



<p>The Crosso Dry Panniers also have one of the highest capacities on this list, giving you a huge 60L of space. Beaten on size only by the pricey Ortlieb Back-Roller Pros, the Crosso Dry Panniers are ideal for long tours where you&#8217;ll need a lot of gear. They use the reliable roll-down closing system and are 100% waterproof.</p>



<p><strong>Size:</strong> 60L | <strong>Weight: </strong>1.65kg</p>

<h3 id="btwin-kompaktrail-bike-bag-69-98">BTWIN Kompaktrail Bike Bag (£69.98)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/btwin-kompaktrail-bike-bag.jpg" alt="BTWIN Kompaktrail Bike Bag" class="wp-image-81485" width="584" height="584"/></figure>



<p><strong><em>Excellent value stuff-sack style panniers.</em></strong></p>



<p>Practical and waterproof, the BTWIN Kompaktrail bike bags are amazing value for money. Coming in at just £69.98 for a pair, they&#8217;re certainly a lot cheaper than most on this list. I used these panniers on my <a href="https://www.theplanetedit.com/london-to-istanbul-bicycle-diary/" data-type="post" data-id="7558">London to Istanbul tour</a> and had zero problems with them. In fact, I loved them! They&#8217;re super easy to take on and off the bike, completely waterproof and seemed pretty resilient.</p>



<p>The BTWIN Kompaktrails are quite basic in terms of design — rather like a large bucket — but in many ways, this is a good thing. They&#8217;re simple and functional with no-frills. While they may not be the <em>best </em>panniers for touring, they are very good value and a great budget option.</p>
