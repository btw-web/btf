<h1>EuroVelo 6 Guide: Explore Europe&#8217;s Rivers by Bicycle</h1>

<p>I&#8217;ve just completed a 3-month bicycle tour across Europe. I started in London and used <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.eurovelo.com/ev6" target="_blank" class="rank-math-link">EuroVelo 6</a> for the majority of the way to make my way to Istanbul. I loved my time on the route and want to encourage every cyclist to experience it &#8211; it truly is wonderful. Hopefully, this EuroVelo 6 guide will provide a good overview of what to expect.</p>



<p>EuroVelo 6 is one of the most popular cycle routes in Europe. It&#8217;s little wonder why &#8211; the route boasts medieval castles, colourful villages, famous rivers and capital cities, as well as a flat topography and excellent infrastructure. The route will take you to Vienna, Bratislava and Budapest; it&#8217;ll wind you through national parks; and you&#8217;ll witness the wonderful scenery along the Loire, Rhine and Danube rivers.</p>



<p>Starting at the Atlantic Coast and ending at The Black Sea, EuroVelo 6 will take you 4,448km across the entire European continent.</p>

<h2 id="why-europe-by-bike">Why Europe by bike?</h2>



<p>It seems that <a href="https://www.theplanetedit.com/bicycle-touring-guide/">bicycle touring</a> is undergoing a boom at the moment. There are many possible reasons for this, but above all, travelling by bike allows for a kind of freedom and independence that&#8217;s hard to find in other types of travel. Many first-time bike tourers, like myself, select Europe as their first adventure. It&#8217;s a great continent to cycle across: bike paths are decent, amenities are great and distances between cities and towns are much smaller than in other parts of the world. Oh, and let&#8217;s not forget that Europe is incredibly diverse with beautiful scenery and fascinating cultures.</p>



<h2 id="why-choose-eurovelo-6">Why choose EuroVelo 6?</h2>



<p><strong>Sights and scenery:&nbsp;</strong>The route will take you through some of Europe&#8217;s greatest cities and historical sites, as well as treat you to a variety of beautiful riverside views and picturesque towns.</p>



<p><strong>Flat topography:&nbsp;</strong>Most of EuroVelo 6 is very flat, making it ideal for beginners or those looking for a leisurely cycling holiday. The route through Serbia is a little more mountainous than the rest of the route, and Germany also has some hilly sections, but for the most part, you&#8217;ll find the cycling easy.</p>



<p><strong>Easy to navigate:&nbsp;</strong>EuroVelo 6 is very easy to navigate, given that you&#8217;ll be able to use both signposts and rivers as your guides. Signposting is excellent in Western Europe, in particular. It&#8217;s good enough that you probably won&#8217;t need to refer to a map, but I recommend downloading the EuroVelo 6 app to use as a GPS just in case.</p>



<p><b>Excellent infrastructure:&nbsp;</b>Europe is, for the most part, very well set up for cyclists. Bike paths are well-maintained (usually), accommodation is easy to find and bike shops are plentiful. Motorists are also used to seeing cyclists on the route, so will give you space and respect.</p>

<h2 id="infrastructure-and-amenities">Infrastructure and amenities</h2>



<p><strong>France </strong>is extremely well set up for cyclists. It has plenty of bike shops, bike-friendly accommodation and excellent roads for cycling. A quick glance at a map will show you just how many small roads (D roads) there are, which usually have little traffic on them. The roads in France are very bike-friendly, and motorists will give you space and respect. A lot of France&#8217;s EuroVelo 6 actually follows canal towpaths, where there is zero motorised traffic.</p>



<p>You should be aware that many shops in France, including supermarkets and restaurants, close at midday for 2-3 hours. My father needed a bike repair shop after completely bursting a tyre, and we had to wait 2 hours for one to open. It also means you&#8217;ll likely need to purchase lunch and enough water in the morning.</p>



<p><strong>Germany, Austria and Switzerland&nbsp;</strong>are also extremely well set up for cyclists. <strong>Switzerland</strong> is particularly pricey, though; they use Swiss Franc rather than Euro. Because you&#8217;ll be following the Rhine River on the border of Switzerland and Germany, I recommend heading into <strong>Germany</strong> for better value accommodation and groceries. There is no border control, so it&#8217;s a matter of just crossing the river via a bridge.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll notice changes in the cycling conditions quite quickly once you leave Austria behind and head into <strong>Eastern Europe.</strong> The roads aren&#8217;t always as well maintained, so potholes and other problems are common. The signposting is also not as great, so be sure your GPS and maps are up to date.</p>



<p>Accommodation options and frequency of supermarkets also declines as you head East, but they&#8217;re still abundant enough that you won&#8217;t run into serious problems. You&#8217;ll just need to plan ahead a little more; use Google Maps to find campsites in advance, for example, as distances between them can be large.</p>



<p><strong>Hungary&nbsp;</strong>has some uninspiring sections along its route, where you&#8217;ll find yourself pedalling along monotonous farmland for kilometres on end. The surface of its bike paths were also some of the worst I found in Europe &#8211; dirt roads with a sand-like substance, where your bike would skid if you weren&#8217;t careful, were common. Despite this, Hungary does have some very beautiful stretches which make it worthwhile.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-7631"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="900" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/eurovelo-6-hungary-2.jpg" alt="EuroVelo 6 in Hungary" class="wp-image-81598"/><figcaption>Drab scenery and bad bike paths in Hungary</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>I found <strong>Croatia&#8217;s</strong> roads to be excellent for cycling. Most of my time in Croatia consisted of riding along flat, smooth roads with relatively little traffic. The roads usually had beautiful scenery, too. There were a couple of stretches where the road surface wasn&#8217;t so pristine, namely near the Duna-Drava Nemzeti Park on the border of Hungary, but it was still perfectly rideable.</p>



<p><strong>Serbia&nbsp;</strong>was a surprise to me. The roads in Eastern Serbia, in particular, were mostly smooth and well-maintained. In Western Serbia, dirt paths were common, but these were scenic and still rideable. The roads coming out of Backa Palanka, Novi Sad and Belgrade were busy and a little hairy to cycle on.</p>



<p>Signposting was good throughout the country &#8211; Serbia&#8217;s EV6 signs were actually quite fun, with funny notes or anecdotes. Cycling isn&#8217;t overly popular in Serbia, so the country isn&#8217;t particularly well set up for bike tourists &#8211; for example, bike shops aren&#8217;t common. Nonetheless, there are plenty of small shops and restaurants to find food and drink throughout the day.</p>



<p>Be advised that from Golubac and through Serbia&#8217;s Djderdap National Park, you&#8217;ll encounter tunnels carved through the mountain pass. These tunnels are dark and some are quite long, so be sure you&#8217;re prepared with a headlamp and good tail lights.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-7514 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="900" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/eurovelo-6-serbia-11.jpg" alt="EuroVelo 6 in Serbia" class="wp-image-81607"/><figcaption>Well-maintained roads with epic scenery in Serbia&#8217;s Djerdap National Park</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure exactly what to expect from the road conditions in <strong>Bulgaria</strong>, having heard that traffic on Bulgarian roads can be crazy. I only followed EuroVelo 6 in Bulgaria for a couple of days, but it graced me with little traffic, beautiful scenery and fairly well-maintained roads.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t personally follow EuroVelo 6 in <strong>Romania,&nbsp;</strong>but a fellow cyclist did. She had this to say: &#8220;From Bazias to Drobeta Turnu-Severin there is a spectacular natural landscape with the Danube flowing through the Banat Mountains. From Drobeta Turnu-Severin onwards, the Danube flows along a large plain where the cycling will be relaxed and peaceful.</p>



<p>Accommodation is quite sparse so you will need to really plan ahead. Not all guesthouses can be found online, so <a href="http://www.booking.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">booking.com</a> will not always be overly helpful. Almost every village or town will have a small shop for groceries, but the choice will be limited. The route in Romania is mostly along through roads, but they generally have light traffic so aren&#8217;t as dangerous as I originally expected. Romanian roads have a variety of traffic, including horse-drawn carts, so I think the average driver is used to all sorts.&#8221;</p>



<h2 id="accommodation-along-eurovelo-6">Accommodation along EuroVelo 6</h2>



<p>There is a huge variety of accommodation choices along EuroVelo 6, suitable for all budgets and styles. I personally camped most nights, but there are also lots of hotels, guesthouses and pensions along the route for those who prefer a little more luxury. I found it useful to pin accommodation options along the route on Google Maps, so I always knew how far I was from somewhere to sleep.</p>



<p>Unless you are planning a short trip, it&#8217;s not practical to plan accommodation in advance. Weather, equipment, your body and other factors can all influence the distance you cover each day. I also found that I&#8217;d often find a nice town or attraction and want to spend some time there. It&#8217;s best to remain as flexible as possible.</p>



<h3 id="camping">Camping</h3>



<p>Campsites in Western Europe are abundant, with campsites in almost every town, so you shouldn&#8217;t struggle to find one at the end of the day. Two-star campsites will likely be the best for you, as they have washrooms and showers, but without the frills, making them great value for money.</p>



<p>Camping options aren&#8217;t as abundant as you head further East, but I still always found a campground to spend the night in Hungary, Croatia and Serbia. Serbia&#8217;s camping options were unbelievable value for money, often coming with kitchenettes, complimentary food and drinks from the hosts, and other great facilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Bulgaria&nbsp;</strong>posed some challenges &#8211; I ended up having to stay in hotels due to the lack of campgrounds, and this problem persists in&nbsp;<strong>Romania.</strong></p>



<p>These are some of my <strong>favourite campsites</strong> I stayed at along the EuroVelo 6:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7cy4yT1Wq1UXw8jB8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Regensburg Canoe Club</a> in Regensburg, Germany</li><li><a href="http://www.camping-passau.de/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camping Passau</a> in Passau, Germany</li><li><a href="https://www.wachaucamping-rossatz.at/Home/?setLanguage=EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wachau-Camping Rossatz</a> in Dürnstein, Austria</li><li><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3YSXasZPs962CMvt7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CityCamping</a> in Györ, Hungary</li><li><a href="http://camping.suzabaranje.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camping Suza Baranje</a> in Suza, Croatia</li><li><a href="https://camping-asin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camping Asin</a> in Dobra, Serbia</li><li><a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/rs/guesthouse-stanisavljevic.en-gb.html?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Base Camp for Adventurers</a> in Negotin, Serbia</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-7506"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="900" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wild-camping-serbia.jpg" alt="Wild camping in Serbia" class="wp-image-81632"/><figcaption>Camping options are abundant along EuroVelo 6. I found designated free camping spots on a couple of occasions, like this <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/43mviccYPYsAssot7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free beachside campground</a> in Serbia.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 id="wild-camping">Wild camping</h3>



<p>Wild camping is a great way to save money and enjoy nature &#8211; I met many bike tourists along EuroVelo 6 who wild camped often. Wild camping shouldn&#8217;t be a problem on the <strong>Eastern</strong> part of the route (Hungary onwards). Most farmers and villagers will happily let you camp on their land if you ask, and it&#8217;s also easy enough to find a quiet, secluded spot by the river.</p>



<p>However, wild camping is prohibited in <strong>Western</strong> Europe. Many cyclists do it anyway and don&#8217;t get caught. Despite the fact that it&#8217;s technically prohibited, most countries do have a relatively relaxed attitude to wild campers, and may or may not ask you to move on if you&#8217;re caught. Just make sure to be discrete: find a secluded spot, wait until dusk to set up camp and be gone by early morning.</p>



<h3 id="hotels">Hotels</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ll find hotels, guesthouses and pensions along all of EuroVelo 6. Many are aware that they&#8217;re on a popular bike route and so have good amenities for cyclists, such as bicycle parking. Hotels in Germany and Austria would often have signs outside to let cyclists know their bikes are welcome: “Radfahrer Wilkommen.” <a href="http://www.booking.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Booking.com</a> has the biggest selection of hotels if you prefer to book a day in advance &#8211; which I recommend you do if you&#8217;re cycling in the summer months.</p>



<h3 id="warm-showers">Warm Showers</h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar, <a href="https://www.warmshowers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warm Showers</a> is a free worldwide hospitality exchange for touring cyclists. It&#8217;s a fantastic community &#8211; cyclists offer to host other cyclists for a night. You&#8217;ll be given a place to sleep and a shower, but it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll also be given food and a beer! Warm Showers hosts are most abundant in Western Europe &#8211; particularly France &#8211; but there are a few in Eastern Europe, too.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, EuroVelo 6 is <strong>very well signposted in Western Europe</strong>. Signs are displayed at every junction and are often also placed every few kilometres to confirm that you are still on the right path. I also found that if I did look lost, locals would sometimes notice my loaded bike, say &#8220;EuroVelo?&#8221; and point me in the right direction.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-7249 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="900" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/eurovelo-6-france.jpg" alt="EuroVelo 6 in France" class="wp-image-81595"/><figcaption>Excellent signposting in France &#8211; notice the EuroVelo 6 logo</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you reach Eastern Europe, you&#8217;ll find that the signposting is not always so good. Particularly in <strong>Hungary</strong> and <strong>Bulgaria</strong>, the signs were sometimes ambiguous or non-existent.</p>



<p>I highly recommend downloading the official EuroVelo 6 app onto your phone so that you&#8217;re always able to find the trail easily. You can also pick up detailed paper maps from local tourism offices along many parts of the route.</p>



<p>You can also download a GPX track for free <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/routes/24442569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a> I loaded this map onto the app <strong>Locus Map Pro</strong>, which I found to be good for navigation. Other cyclists I met swore by the app <strong>Komoot</strong>.</p>



<p>If you do manage to get lost, you can simply find the river &#8211; EuroVelo 6 is called &#8220;The Rivers Route&#8221; for a reason. If you follow the river, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll eventually find your way back onto the bike path.</p>



<p>I personally found that finding my way out of cities and large towns posed the biggest navigational challenges. I distinctly remember finding the correct route out of Basel took about 2 hours, and many cyclists I met said they had real problems getting out of Vienna.</p>



<p>The EuroVelo signs look a little different in each country, so make sure you know what you&#8217;re looking for. Upon arrival in Switzerland, I kept losing the EuroVelo signs, but it turns out they just look a little different from what I was used to seeing in France. The EuroVelo logo isn’t on all the signs, like they were in France, so you just have to follow the bike path symbols.</p>

<h2 id="climate-and-best-time-to-go">Climate and best time to go</h2>



<p>The peak tourist season for most of Europe is July and August, as this is when children are on their summer break from school. As such, prices tend to go up and bike paths tend to get busier. However, July and August do bring warm weather and you&#8217;re less likely to experience rain.</p>



<p>I cycled across Europe from late May to late August, and found that the weather was usually pleasant. The bike paths were not busy, except for along the canals in France and also the section between <a href="https://www.theplanetedit.com/passau-to-vienna-by-bike/">Passau and Vienna</a>.</p>



<p>Campsites did usually have a fair few bike tourists, though, which I loved &#8211; I met some interesting people who enriched my experience. I read online that accommodation options get booked up in the summer and turn cyclists away, but this never happened to me. However, I was in Eastern Europe by the time the school summer holidays started, so the more touristic West may have posed these problems.</p>



<p>To sum, <strong>the route is most comfortably rideable from May to September.</strong> Cycling in winter, with cold weather and short days, is not ideal.</p>



<h2 id="budget-for-bicycle-touring-across-europe">Budget for bicycle touring across Europe</h2>



<p>Your daily touring costs will vary massively depending on your touring style:</p>



<p><strong> €5-10 per day:</strong> If you choose to wild camp, cook your own meals and skip paid attractions, you could potentially tour on a mere €5-10 per day.</p>



<p><strong>€15 per day: </strong>This budget would get you a basic campground and groceries every day, but not much else.</p>



<p><strong>€30 per day: </strong>This budget will get you a campground and groceries every day, and will also allow for some sightseeing and the occasional meal out.</p>



<p><strong>€100 per day:</strong> You could easily burn through over €100 a day if you choose to eat out, stay in hotels every night and do a lot of sightseeing.</p>



<p><em>Most tourers’ daily budget falls somewhere in the €15-30 range. </em></p>



<p>Personally, <strong>I spent roughly €30 per day </strong>cycling the EuroVelo 6. This accumulated to just short of €3000 during my 3 months on the route. I stayed at campsites, cooked my own meals, did some sightseeing, and treated myself to the occasional meal out. I also ensured I had enough money kept aside to cover bike repairs if needed.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that I spent more during the first half of my trip because Western Europe is more expensive than Eastern Europe. <strong>In Eastern Europe, you can expect to pay €5-10 less per day than in Western Europe.</strong></p>



<p>If you&#8217;re unlucky, you may also run into large one-off costs. For example, you may need to pay for bike repairs or have to replace lost or broken equipment. A cyclist I met had to buy a new tent after a child fell onto it at a campsite and ripped a hole into it&#8230;</p>



<p>I would bring more money than you think you need, to ensure you&#8217;re covered if things go a little pear-shaped!</p>

<h2 id="which-bike-should-i-bring">Which bike should I bring?</h2>



<p>I’ll start off by saying that you <strong>don’t need a hardcore/performance bike</strong>. A reasonably sturdy bike that has the ability to carry your load, is comfortable, and has decent tyres will be fine. You really don’t need to spend lots of money if you don’t want to &#8211; EuroVelo 6 isn’t going to test your bike too much. I’d recommend a hybrid or touring bike, or even a road bike fitted with rack mounts and larger tyres would work.</p>



<p>My bike was a fortunate find from a charity shop and was already equipped with everything I needed. It had fitments so I could attach front and rear racks and had recently been fitted with new wheels. I also liked that it was a bit bashed up so it was less likely to be a target for theft! It’s a hybrid from Trek.</p>



<p>Here are some great options for bikes. All of them are <strong>ready for touring</strong>, with technology to maximise comfort and reduce vibrations over long distances, plus they all come with rack mounts and the ability to carry a load:</p>

<h2 id="travel-insurance-for-cycling-across-europe">Travel insurance for cycling across Europe</h2>



<p>I actually found it harder than I expected to find a decent policy that covered long-distance bicycle touring. In the end, I settled for my trusty <a aria-label="World Nomads (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-insurance?affiliate=L4UR3NP34R5&amp;subId=link&amp;utm_source=L4UR3NP34R5&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=Affiliate&amp;utm_content=link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">World Nomads</a>, whom I use for all backpacking and long-term trips.</p>



<p>You can read World Nomads&#8217; policy on cycling-related travel <a aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.worldnomads.com/Turnstile/AffiliateLink?partnerCode=L4UR3NP34R5&amp;utm_source=L4UR3NP34R5&amp;source=weblink&amp;utm_content=weblink&amp;path=https://www.worldnomads.com/uk/help/insurance/buying-travel-insurance/cycling-or-mountain-biking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="rank-math-link">here</a>, but here are the basics:</p>



<ul><li>Cycle touring is covered but the tour must be on one continent only &#8211; no cover is available for intercontinental cycle touring. This is fine if you are doing EuroVelo 6 / staying in Europe only!</li></ul>



<ul><li>You&#8217;ll need to tick <strong>&#8216;cycling &#8211; independent cycle touring&#8217;</strong> when buying your policy.</li></ul>



<p>I have a whole post on <a href="https://www.theplanetedit.com/cycle-touring-insurance/" data-type="post" data-id="81178">choosing cycle touring insurance</a>, including 6 good providers to pick from.</p>



<p>I hope you found this EuroVelo 6 guide useful. As this was my first big bike tour, I researched lots online and couldn&#8217;t find the answer to everything I wanted, so hopefully, I&#8217;ve managed to cover everything you might want to know.</p>
