<h1>Cycle Touring Insurance: What You Need To Know and the 6 Best Insurance Providers</h1>

<p>Finding a good travel insurance policy to cover you for a cycle tour is really important. The risks of cycling in foreign places are generally higher than cycling at home, and being stuck with a huge medical bill is something you <em>really</em> want to avoid.</p>



<p>And while it&#8217;s important to be covered for your trip, finding good cycle touring insurance can be a headache. A <em>real </em>headache.</p>



<p>Most travel insurance providers will only cover cycling if it&#8217;s <em>incidental</em> to your trip, i.e. if you hired a bike for a day during your two-week vacation, but not if the primary purpose of the trip is cycling. As you can see, <a href="https://www.theplanetedit.com/bicycle-touring-guide/" data-type="post" data-id="12428">cycle touring</a> is not covered under these grounds. </p>



<p>Cycle touring is considered by many travel insurers to be a ‘hazardous activity&#8217; or an ‘extreme sport’, and so will either incur a premium or is completely excluded from the list of activities covered.</p>



<p>Cycle tourists, therefore, need to find a travel insurance policy that <strong>includes cycle touring</strong> as an activity.  This can make the search for cycle touring insurance quite frustrating, but at least it narrows down the field.</p>



<p>In this article, I&#8217;ll walk you through everything you need to know about choosing a cycle touring insurance policy and show you 6 great providers that I recommend.&#8217;</p>

<h2 id="bicycle-insurance-and-cycle-touring-insurance-are-two-different-things">Bicycle insurance and cycle touring insurance are two different things</h2>



<p>Remember when I said that finding good cycle touring insurance can be a real headache? Well, one of the other issues is that most travel insurance policies <strong>won&#8217;t cover the theft of your bicycle.</strong> Touring bikes are considered to be extremely stealable (which they are) and so insurers don&#8217;t want to pay out for them.</p>



<p>Essentially, bicycle insurance and cycle touring insurance are two very different things. </p>



<p><strong>Bicycle insurance </strong>covers theft, damage and vandalism to your <em>bicycle</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Cycle touring insurance</strong> is travel insurance that will cover <em>you</em> for medical expenses, personal liability etc while you are cycling abroad.</p>



<p>Most insurance providers will either protect you <em>or </em>your bicycle, but very few will protect both under one policy. Those that do usually only cover a bike worth £1000 or less. If this is you, then great! But if you&#8217;re the proud owner of a £1000+ touring bike, this might not be good enough.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sportscoverdirect.com/insurance/cycle-touring-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SportsCover Direct</a> is the only provider I&#8217;ve been able to find that will allow you to add over £1000 of equipment cover onto your travel insurance policy. They allow a whopping £5600 of sporting equipment (bikes included) to be added onto your plan, but you will pay through the nose for this.</p>



<p>If you want your bicycle to be covered as well as yourself, and don&#8217;t want to spend a small fortune on insurance, you&#8217;ll likely need to take out two separate policies. One for you, and one for your bike.</p>



<p>To be fair, I imagine if you own an expensive touring bike, you likely already have insurance for it. Just check that this insurance covers you in the countries you&#8217;ll be visiting and allows for cycle touring as an activity. You&#8217;ll also want to check the insurance will still cover theft of the bike if it were to be taken from, say, a campsite or while it&#8217;s locked up outside a shop.</p>



<p>Luckily for me, my bike is not worth much in terms of actual money, so I don&#8217;t bother insuring it while I tour.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="900" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/touring-bikes-arras.jpg" alt="Touring bikes in Arras, France" class="wp-image-81588"/><figcaption>Think about whether you want your bike itself to be covered as well</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-when-choosing-cycle-touring-insurance">What you need to know when choosing cycle touring insurance</h2>



<h3 id="what-doesn-t-insurance-cover">What doesn&#8217;t insurance cover?</h3>



<p>Cycle touring insurance is unlikely to cover accidents that happen if:</p>



<ul><li>You are under the influence of drugs or alcohol</li><li>You are not wearing a helmet</li><li>You are cycling recklessly or unlawfully, such as passing through a red light</li><li>You crash on a path or road where cycling is prohibited</li><li>You travel to countries against FCDO advice, e.g. Syria, Afghanistan</li></ul>



<p>Make sure to read up on the small print to understand what might make any claims void.</p>



<h3 id="what-doesn-t-insurance-cover">Does the policy protect your bicycle as well as you?</h3>



<p>As I mentioned previously, there are very few travel insurance policies that will cover the loss, theft or damage of an expensive bicycle. Those that do will usually only cover a bike up to the value of £1000. If your bike is worth more than this, consider taking out a separate bicycle insurance policy to protect it.</p>



<h3 id="how-long-will-you-be-touring">How long will you be touring?</h3>



<p>Some cycle touring insurance policies have a limit of how long they will cover you. For example, <a href="https://www.yellowjersey.co.uk/cycle-travel-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellow Jersey</a> will provide up to 120 days of insurance, whereas <a href="https://safetywing.com/nomad-insurance?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Safety Wing</a> will cover you indefinitely on a monthly subscription.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="900" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/travel-insurance-for-cycle-tourists.jpg" alt="travel insurance for cycle tourists" class="wp-image-81194"/></figure>



<h2 id="6-best-cycle-touring-insurance-providers-1">6 best cycle touring insurance providers</h2>



<p>Below are my recommendations of some of the best cycle touring insurance providers. I&#8217;ll give an overview of each insurance policy and detail what it covers, as well as the quote I received for 3 months touring in Europe and 12 months touring worldwide to give you an idea of costs. (As a 26-year-old with no pre-existing medical conditions).</p>



<p>Sorry for the bias towards UK providers; most of my readers are based in the UK, but there are some listed here (World Nomads and Safety Wing) that do insure worldwide.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> The information provided below is accurate as of January 2022. Policy details and prices are likely to change; make sure to check the terms to ensure you&#8217;re covered for what you need.</em></p>



<h3 id="6-best-cycle-touring-insurance-providers">1) World Nomads</h3>



<p>World Nomads is my personal go-to for all kinds of travel. I&#8217;ve used them for backpacking, hiking and cycle touring trips all over the world. Their policy is available to residents from 130+ countries, covers over 200 adventure activities (including cycle touring) and can be extended indefinitely. The flexibility and great customer service are why World Nomads is my no.1 choice.</p>



<p>You can read World Nomads’ policy on <a href="https://www.worldnomads.com/Turnstile/AffiliateLink?partnerCode=L4UR3NP34R5&amp;utm_source=L4UR3NP34R5&amp;source=weblink&amp;utm_content=weblink&amp;path=https://www.worldnomads.com/uk/help/insurance/buying-travel-insurance/cycling-or-mountain-biking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cycling-related travel&nbsp;here</a>, but here are the basics:</p>



<ul><li>Cycle touring is covered but the tour must be on one continent only – no cover is available for intercontinental cycle touring.</li><li>You’ll need to add <strong>‘cycling – level 2 &#8211; independent cycle touring’</strong>&nbsp;when buying your policy.</li></ul>



<p>So while World Nomads do not cover intercontinental cycle touring, they are a great choice for a tour of any length that&#8217;ll be taking place on a single continent. <a href="https://www.theplanetedit.com/cycling-eurovelo-6-guide/" data-type="post" data-id="6776">EuroVelo 6</a>, anyone?</p>



<p>For 3 months touring in Europe, I was quoted £164. For 12 months touring in Asia, I was quoted £930.</p>



<h3 id="6-best-cycle-touring-insurance-providers">2) Adventures Cover</h3>



<p>The policy offered by <a href="https://www.adventurescover.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adventures Cover</a> is, in my opinion, the most comprehensive and best value option out there for cycle tours of 6 months or less. They offer a generous cover of £10 million in medical expenses, £2 million in personal liability and up to £1000 for activity equipment. Just make sure to add <strong>&#8220;cycle touring&#8221;</strong> from the activity options when buying your policy.</p>



<p>I was quoted £129 for 3 months touring in Europe and £541 for 6 months touring worldwide.</p>



<h3 id="6-best-cycle-touring-insurance-providers">3) Safety Wing</h3>



<p>Safety Wing is a US-based travel insurance provider specifically designed for nomads, i.e. people who work and/or travel abroad for extended periods of time. Their insurance plans are a monthly subscription, which is great if you&#8217;re heading out on a tour for an unspecified length of time. You can continue with your insurance coverage until the end of your cycle tour, at which point you can simply stop your subscription. This is great for cycling nomads.</p>



<p>They specifically say that they cover <strong>&#8220;biking &#8211; includes touring and organised tours&#8221;</strong> but this must be in a non-professional and non-competitive capacity. For Safety Wing&#8217;s <a href="https://safetywing.com/nomad-insurance?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nomad Insurance Policy</a>, I was quoted 119 USD for 3 months in Europe and 881 USD for 12 months worldwide.</p>



<h3 id="4-big-cat-travel-insurance">4) Big Cat Travel Insurance</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.bigcattravelinsurance.com/travel-insurance/cycle-touring-travel-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Cat Travel Insurance</a> prides itself on &#8220;whatever you&#8217;re doing, we&#8217;ve got you covered&#8221; and offers specialist travel insurance for backpacking, winter sports and extreme activities. When buying their policy, you can &#8220;add on&#8221; a range of different things to tailor the plan to your needs.</p>



<p>You must ensure you select the <strong>&#8220;activity pack&#8221;</strong> when choosing your add ons, otherwise cycle touring will not be covered. You can also choose the &#8220;gadgets and valuables&#8221; add on to cover your bicycle against theft, loss and damage up to a value of £1000.</p>



<p>For 3 months in Europe, I was quoted £84 on the Standard Plan. With &#8220;gadgets and valuables&#8221; added to this, the total came to £140. For a 12 month worldwide trip, I was quoted £481 on the Standard Plan. With &#8220;gadgets and valuables&#8221; added to this, the total came to £652.</p>



<h3 id="5-yellow-jersey">5) Yellow Jersey</h3>



<p>Yellow Jersey are a UK-based insurance company designed specifically for cyclists. They offer policies for both bicycles AND for cycle travel. Their policies will cover you for up to 120 days.</p>



<p>Under their <a href="https://www.yellowjersey.co.uk/cycle-travel-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cycle travel policy</a>, you&#8217;ll get £10 million medical expenses and £2 million personal liability. You&#8217;ll also get some great cycling-related benefits such as a £200 bike breakdown benefit, £250 cycle repatriation benefit and £2000 gadget cover. If you&#8217;d like to add cover for your bicycle against theft, damage and vandalism as well, Yellow Jersey offers a separate <a href="https://www.yellowjersey.co.uk/bicycle-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bicycle insurance policy.</a></p>



<p>For a 30 day tour in Europe, I was quoted £90. For a 120 day worldwide tour, I was quoted £330. If your tour will be more than 30 days, you&#8217;ll have to choose &#8220;annual multi-trip&#8221; and select the number of days your trip will be.</p>



<h3 id="6-sportscover-direct">6) SportsCover Direct</h3>



<p>Under <a href="https://www.sportscoverdirect.com/insurance/cycle-touring-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SportsCover Direct&#8217;s</a> policy, you&#8217;ll simply need to select <strong>&#8220;cycle touring&#8221;</strong> as an activity to be covered. They offer a comprehensive £10 million of medical expenses and £2 million of personal liability under their Bronze Plan. For a 3 month tour in Europe, I was quoted £97. For a 12 month worldwide tour, I was quoted £387. </p>



<p>SportsCover Direct&#8217;s Gold Plan will also provide extensive cover for lost, damaged or stolen bikes and equipment. This plan allows you to choose the total amount of sports equipment you want to cover for &#8211; up to an incredible £5600. Bear in mind that it does make the policy very expensive when you add on, for example, a £2100 bike.</p>
