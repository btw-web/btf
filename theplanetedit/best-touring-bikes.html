<h1>The 10 Very Best Touring Bikes For 2022</h1>

<p>Looking for a new touring companion and want to know which are the best touring bikes for  2022? You&#8217;re in the right place.</p>



<p>Touring is all about the marathon, rather than the sprint, and it demands a bike that you can comfortably ride all day while carrying a load. With this in mind, the best touring bikes are happy rolling across a variety of terrain and capable of hauling heavy loads up hills. They&#8217;re also kitted out with standard yet reliable components, so that you can find spare parts easily while on the road, even if you’re in a remote town in the middle of nowhere.</p>



<p>This article will showcase 10 of the best touring bikes on the market, including details on what they&#8217;re best for, important specifications and more.</p>



<p class="has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background"><strong>Tip:</strong> The touring bikes listed below are ideal for what I would call &#8216;classic&#8217; touring. I.e., they&#8217;re best suited for long-distance touring on mostly paved roads, but capable of riding on dirt and gravel paths etc when necessary.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="900" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Trek-520-Disc-Touring-Bike.jpg" alt="Best touring bikes" class="wp-image-12756"/><figcaption>The Trek 520 Disc is one of the best touring bikes out there and an absolute classic. I&#8217;ll be talking about this later on!</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2 id="how-to-choose-the-best-touring-bike-for-you">How to choose the best touring bike for you</h2>



<p>Before I show you the best touring bikes on the market, you&#8217;ll want to think about a few things:</p>



<ul><li>Will you be touring short-term or long-term?</li><li>Is your route mostly on-road or off-road?</li><li>Where in the world will you be touring?</li><li>How much gear will you be carrying?</li><li>What&#8217;s your budget?</li></ul>



<p>The answers to these questions will ultimately define <a href="https://www.theplanetedit.com/how-to-choose-a-touring-bike/" data-type="post" data-id="15345">which touring bike is best <em>for you</em>.</a> The very best touring bikes are <strong>expensive</strong>, so if the demands of your tour(s) aren&#8217;t going to test the bike too much, it&#8217;s really not necessary to buy the best. Unless you want to, of course!</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re new to touring and just want a bike that will take you comfortably on tarmac roads and bike paths, an entry-level bike would be fine for you. If you&#8217;re a veteran tourer looking to cycle across the world, you might want to invest in an expedition standard bike. Think about where your touring style sits between these two extremes.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve split this article into two sections, so you can narrow down your search:</p>



<ul><li><a href="http://theplanetedit.com/best-touring-bikes#entry-level">Best entry-level touring bikes</a> (less than £1000)</li><li><a href="http://theplanetedit.com/best-touring-bikes#premium-bikes">Best premium touring bikes</a> (over £1000)</li></ul>



<h2 id="entry-level">The best entry-level touring bikes in 2022</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re new to touring, or perhaps tour infrequently for short periods of time, these entry-level bikes could be ideal for you. They&#8217;ll get you comfortably from A to B without breaking the bank.</p>



<h3 id="ridgeback-tour-849">Ridgeback Tour (£849)</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="723" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ridgeback-Tour-e1637251009247.jpg" alt="Ridgeback Tour" class="wp-image-15316"/><figcaption>Image supplied by Ridgeback</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong><em>A budget option with classic style.</em></strong></p>



<p>The Ridgeback Tour has a lot in common with its dearer cousin the Ridgeback Panorama (below), but with cost-saving components, such as an aluminium frame, rim brakes, and a basic but reliable drivetrain.</p>



<p>The Tour may be the cheapest of Ridgeback&#8217;s touring bike range, but it&#8217;s still ready for the open road, coming with full-length mudguards and a rear pannier rack as standard. Since <a href="https://road.cc/content/tech-news/dawes-ends-galaxy-touring-bike-line-after-49-years-278623" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawes discontinued the much-loved Galaxy</a> in 2020, there&#8217;s been a gap in the market for a great entry-level touring bike, which the Ridgeback Tour might just fill.</p>



<p><strong>Frame: </strong>Aluminium<br><strong>Wheel size: </strong>700c<br><strong>Tyres: </strong>Continental Contact 700x32c<br><strong>Brakes: </strong>Tektro CR-510 Rim Brakes<br><strong>Gearing: </strong>48-38-28T chainset, 11-32T cassette<br><strong>Accessories: </strong>Rear rack and mudguards<br></p>



<p> <strong>→ </strong> Buy the Ridgeback Tour 2021 from <a href="https://welovecycles.com/product/ridgeback-tour-teal-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We Love Cycles.</a></p>



<h3 id="cube-touring-pro-849">Cube Touring Pro (£849)</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cube-touring-pro.jpg" alt="Cube Touring Pro" class="wp-image-15287"/><figcaption>Image supplied by Cube</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong><em>A hybrid-style touring bike.</em></strong></p>



<p>Fully equipped with a rear rack, taillights and mudguards, the Cube Touring Pro is ready for adventure straight out of the box. </p>



<p>This bike is a hybrid at heart, rather than a true touring bike, but take it from me: hybrids can be great for touring. The Cube Touring Pro handles gravel paths with ease, thanks to its plush suspension fork and grippy Schwalbe Range Cruiser tyres. While it may be slower than a typical touring bike, it&#8217;ll keep you comfortable over those bumpier roads.</p>



<p><strong>Frame: </strong>Aluminium<br><strong>Wheel size: </strong>700c<br><strong>Tyres: </strong>Schwalbe Range Cruiser, Active, 47-622<br><strong>Brakes:</strong> Shimano BR-MT200 Hydraulic Disc<br><strong>Gearing: </strong>48-36-26T chainset, 12-32T cassette<br><strong>Accessories: </strong>Rear rack, mudguards, taillights and kickstand</p>

<h2 id="premium-bikes">The best premium touring bikes in 2022</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re a frequent tourer looking for a great bike, this list will help you find your perfect companion. While you should expect to spend upwards of £1,000 on a new, fully-featured premium touring bike, rest assured that it should last a lifetime if well cared for.</p>



<h3 id="ridgeback-expedition-1-349">Ridgeback Expedition (£1,349)</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="501" src="https://www.theplanetedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ridgeback-expedition-bike.png" alt="Ridgeback Expedition touring bike" class="wp-image-15272"/><figcaption>Image supplied by Ridgeback</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><em><strong>A rugged, expedition-ready, flat bar option</strong></em>.</p>



<p>As the name would suggest, the Ridgeback Expedition is ideal for long-haul touring expeditions. The model originally launched in 2014 and has been tweaked and perfected over the years, with the 2022 model the best version yet.</p>



<p>While still a touring bike at heart, the Expedition has many characteristics of a mountain bike, making it a great choice for those who need something a little more rugged. Its got a wide range of 27 gears, giving it the ability to climb steep hills with ease; chunky 26-inch Schwalbe Marathon tyres for excellent puncture resistance and off-road capability; cable disc brakes, and flat bars for added stability over rough terrain. </p>



<p><strong>Frame:</strong> Steel<br><strong>Wheel size: </strong>26-inch<br><strong>Tyres:</strong> Shwalbe Marathon GG 26 x 1.75<br><strong>Brakes:</strong> Promax DSK-300 Mechanical Disc<br><strong>Gearing:</strong> 48-36-26T chainset, 11-36T cassette<br><strong>Accessories:</strong> Mudguards</p>

<p><strong><em>Built to haul heavy luggage over vast distances.</em></strong></p>



<p>The Panorama is Ridgeback&#8217;s most expensive model in their touring bike range, describing itself as “ready for any adventure you have in mind”. A bold claim, if you ask me.</p>



<p>But the wheels, dressed in Schwalbe Marathon tyres, are built for toughness, with Jalco’s DM25 rims that are designed for cross-country and trekking bikes. Paired with a full Shimano drive and TRP Spyre disc brakes, you&#8217;ve got yourself a reliable bike capable of taking on the world.</p>



<p><strong>Frame: </strong>Steel<br><strong>Wheel size: </strong>700c<br><strong>Tyres: </strong>Shwalbe Marathon GG 700 x 35c<br><strong>Brakes:</strong> TRP Spyre Mechanical Disc<br><strong>Gearing: </strong>48-36-26T chainset, 11-34T cassette<br><strong>Accessories: </strong>Rear rack, mudguards and 2 bottle cages</p>

<h3 id="trek-520-disc-1-650">Trek 520 Disc (£1,650)</h3>

<p><strong><em>A tried and tested reliable packhorse.</em></strong></p>



<p>The Trek 520 Disc touring bike is known to be a bit of a classic among cycle tourists, having been in Trek&#8217;s line-up for <em>ages</em>. It&#8217;s a steel packhorse, equipped with both rear and front racks, and a drive train that&#8217;s designed for hauling a heavy load.</p>



<p>Using a mix of Shimano Sora and Alivio parts, its nine-speed cassette and triple chainset provide a wide range of 27 durable gears, making it ideal for<strong> </strong>touring in hilly countries.</p>



<p>The price tag might make you gulp, but the Trek 520 Disc is built to last and will be a reliable touring companion. As Trek themselves say, &#8220;you&#8217;ll leave this bike to someone in your will.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Frame:</strong> Trek Butted Chromoly<br><strong>Wheel size: </strong>700c<br><strong>Tyres:</strong> 700x38c Bontrager H1 Hard-case Ultimate<br><strong>Brakes:</strong> TRP Spyre Mechanical Disc<br><strong>Gearing:</strong> 48-36-26 chainset, 11–36 9-speed cassette<br><strong>Accessories:</strong> Front and rear rack</p>

<h3 id="kona-sutra-1-899">Kona Sutra (£1,899)</h3>

<p><em><strong>Stylish and modern, yet very functional.</strong></em></p>



<p>Kona have always been progressively-minded and like to break the mould when it comes to their bikes. In fact, the Sutra was one of the first touring bikes to start using disc brakes in the early 2010s. The Kona Sutra 2022 is also progressively-minded; a sporty, modern take on the &#8216;classic&#8217; touring bike.</p>



<p>In my opinion, the Sutra is a <em>gorgeous </em>bike, thanks to its satin black frame and retro brown accents. It&#8217;s not just stylish though; it&#8217;s also incredibly functional, with hydraulic disk brakes and a reliable drivetrain. It even comes with a Brooks B17 saddle as standard, which die-hard Brooks fans will be pleased to hear.</p>



<p><strong>Frame: </strong>Kona Butted Chromoly<br><strong>Wheel size: </strong>700c<br><strong>Tyres:</strong> Schwalbe Marathon Mondial 700x40c<br><strong>Brakes:</strong> TRP HDC711C Mechanical / Hydraulic Disc<br><strong>Gearing:</strong> 11-36t 10-speed cassette<br><strong>Accessories: </strong>Front rack and mudguards</p>

<p><strong><em>A much-loved touring bike capable of traversing the globe.</em></strong></p>



<p>Many consider the <a href="https://surlybikes.com/bikes/disc_trucker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Surly Disc Trucker</a> to be the gold standard of touring bikes, as it has everything a cycle tourist would need to traverse the globe. And sure enough, time and testing have proved that this bike can handle a heavy-loaded tour better than a lot of its competitors.</p>



<p>It was originally built as a disc brake version of the legendary Surly Long Haul Trucker. However, the Disc Trucker has now completely replaced its older sibling, as Surly announced in 2021 that it would no longer be producing the Long Haul Trucker. Looks like the jury is in: disc brakes are the way forward!</p>



<p>It&#8217;s got tons of useful mounting points, ideal for adding racks, water bottle cages and more, although it doesn&#8217;t actually come with any accessories, so you&#8217;ll have to factor this into the cost.</p>

<p>The Tour de Fer 30 is, without a doubt, a reliable adventure machine. Genesis have dressed the strong Chromoly frame with durable, expedition-worthy components, such as a Shimano Tiagra 4700 3&#215;10 drivetrain and TRP Spyre Disc Brakes. They&#8217;ve also included a dynamo hub for year-round, charge-free lighting. You can even add supplementary power banks or USB chargers.</p>



<p>This bike is ready for an epic tour straight out of the box. The only question is: where will you go?</p>
