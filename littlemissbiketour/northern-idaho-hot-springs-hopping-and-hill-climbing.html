<h1>Northern Idaho: Hot Springs Hopping and Hill Climbing</h1>
<h2><strong>Five Hot Springs to Treat Yourself to on the TransAmerica Bicycle Route</strong></h2>
<p>Idaho is a rugged ride. There are no &#8220;easy miles&#8221; on the <a href="http://littlemissbiketour.com/2019/04/17/what-is-the-transamerica-bicycle-trail/">TransAmerica bike route</a> that crosses the northern part of the Gem State. When I wasn&#8217;t climbing one of the three major passes on this segment of the route, I was doing battle with road work, headwinds, heat, no cellphone coverage, and huge vehicles that don&#8217;t share the road.</p>
<p>I needed some relief.</p>
<p>Luckily, Idaho redeems itself with a trail of hot springs to hop. I&#8217;m a bit of a hot springs fanatic. I&#8217;ve been spoiled by <a href="http://cynthiaord.com/wp/blog/2014/07/12/what-i-love-about-colorados-hot-springs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colorado&#8217;s hot springs</a> and other geothermal gems worldwide, so my standards are high. I took the time to scout out all the hot springs I could find so that you, my fellow hot springs freaks and bike nuts, can get the details. I&#8217;ve even given them star ratings. You&#8217;re welcome.</p>

<h2><strong>Mundo Hot Springs (near Cambridge, Idaho)</strong></h2>
<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re riding eastbound on the TransAm, then <a href="http://www.mundohotsprings.com/">Mundo Hot Springs</a> sets itself up nicely as a reward after climbing the first major pass. This is a developed hot springs and campground, charging $12 per person to camp and $5 to soak. I did both.</p>
<p>At the campground, I met badass bikepacker <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rebecca_vader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebecca Vader</a>, and we started talking bike travel over a bottle of whiskey. When we made it over to the pool, it was the perfect temperature for soaking &#8212; right around 100 degrees F. Complete with pool noodles, this spot was great for deep relaxation. My only complaint is that it closes at 8pm. I could have stayed in there for another couple hours.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-384" src="http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zims-hot-springs-idaho.jpg" alt="zims hot springs idaho" width="797" height="797" srcset="http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zims-hot-springs-idaho.jpg 797w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zims-hot-springs-idaho-150x150.jpg 150w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zims-hot-springs-idaho-300x300.jpg 300w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/zims-hot-springs-idaho-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Zim&#8217;s Hot Springs (near New Meadows, Idaho)</strong></h2>
<p>⭐⭐⭐</p>
<p>When you reach New Meadows, keep going north on Highway 95 for another four miles. Here you&#8217;ll find another developed hot springs and campground called <a href="http://www.idahohotsprings.com/destinations/zims/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zim&#8217;s</a>. Camping costs $10 and soaking costs $8. Again, I did both.</p>
<p>At this point, I had joined up with two other &#8220;eastbounders&#8221;, Quinn and Steve, who also stayed and camped. I noticed that the place was a little more rustic than Mundo had been, and the pools weren&#8217;t quite as photo-worthy. The two pools were a comfortable upper-80s and steamy near-100 in temperature, so I drifted between the two. The staffer was really nice and gave us some local cherries.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-385" src="http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/weir-hot-springs.jpg" alt="weir hot springs" width="797" height="797" srcset="http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/weir-hot-springs.jpg 797w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/weir-hot-springs-150x150.jpg 150w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/weir-hot-springs-300x300.jpg 300w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/weir-hot-springs-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Weir Creek Hot Springs (near mile 142 on Highway 12)</strong></h2>
<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
<p>This was my favorite of all the Idaho hot springs, perhaps because it&#8217;s the most hidden and remote. Weir is a primitive hot spring, meaning it&#8217;s not developed and it&#8217;s free to access. The trick is finding it. A westbound TransAm cyclist had tipped me off on the trailhead location just after mile marker 142. Memorize that number, because there is no cellphone service all along the 60+ miles of Highway 12.</p>
<p>I had set up a dispersed campsite about 20 miles downriver the night before (near Wilderness Gateway campground). But if I were to do things again, I&#8217;d push on to mile 142 and camp by the trailhead, where you&#8217;ll find a few dispersed sites with fire pits. Less than ten minutes&#8217; hike up the trail, you&#8217;ll find these gorgeous pools along the Weir Creek &#8212; a tributary to the Lochsa River.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-386" src="http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jerry-johnson-hot-springs.jpg" alt="jerry johnson hot springs" width="797" height="797" srcset="http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jerry-johnson-hot-springs.jpg 797w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jerry-johnson-hot-springs-150x150.jpg 150w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jerry-johnson-hot-springs-300x300.jpg 300w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jerry-johnson-hot-springs-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Jerry Johnson Hot Springs </strong><strong>(near mile 142 on Highway 12)</strong></h2>
<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
<p>About ten miles further up the Lochsa River (mile 152), you&#8217;ll see plenty of signage for the <a href="http://www.idahohotsprings.com/destinations/jerry_johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry Johnson hot springs</a>. The secret&#8217;s out. These primitive springs are more well-known and more visited. Hiking the two miles along the stream to find them, I passed several groups of people, including families with kids.</p>
<p>Although it wasn&#8217;t as secluded as Weir Creek had been, this is still a very rewarding &#8220;in the wild&#8221; hot springs experience. You&#8217;re likely to see visitors &#8220;in the wild&#8221; as well &#8212; it&#8217;s a clothing-optional kind of place.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-387" src="http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lolo-hot-springs-montana.jpg" alt="lolo hot springs montana" width="797" height="797" srcset="http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lolo-hot-springs-montana.jpg 797w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lolo-hot-springs-montana-150x150.jpg 150w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lolo-hot-springs-montana-300x300.jpg 300w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lolo-hot-springs-montana-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Lolo Hot Springs (between Lolo Pass and Lolo, Montana)</strong></h2>
<p>⭐⭐</p>
<p>After the final 4,000 feet of climbing to the top of Lolo Pass, I was looking forward to one more hot springs soak as a reward. Sadly, this one was my least favorite. I pulled into the campground, which cost $17 for a spot on the lawn and broken WiFi. The &#8220;tourist trap&#8221; vibe continued over on the other side of the road, where the pools were surrounded by an array other overpriced tourist services.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even know how much the pools cost, as the attendant had left the front desk, so I just walked in. The main pool is a warm spring-fed version of an average swimming pool. There&#8217;s also a hotter indoor pool in need of a paint job. Nevertheless, my legs appreciated the relief. If I were to do things again, however, I&#8217;d probably skip this one entirely.</p>
<p><strong>My spin on it:</strong> try to find Meir Creek for a primitive hot springs experience, and stay at Mundo for a more &#8220;civilized&#8221; soak. Your calves and quads will thank you.</p>
