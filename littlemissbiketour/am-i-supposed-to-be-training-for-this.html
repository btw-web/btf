<h2><b>I did a test ride</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In mid-April I joined a group of bicycle friends for an overnight bike ride and camping trip.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The route was about 40 miles each way, from Downtown Denver to the foothills of Waterton Canyon. I survived. Despite a light snowfall, road closures, a third of the route on gravel (or mud), and freezing temperatures at night, I did it. My knees were screaming, and Blucifer the road bike was upset with me after all that dirt trail, but I did it. Two 40-mile days in a row, fully loaded. I’m planning at least one more shakedown ride before the real thing.</span></p>

<h2><b>I’ve done long rides before</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m no stranger to long bike rides. I got into road biking about six years ago, when I first bought Blucifer off Craigslist for $300 and joined a </span><a href="http://cynthiaord.com/wp/blog/2013/06/14/pedaling-across-colorado-the-countdown-to-babrac-2013/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cross-Colorado road bike ride</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That route covered 270 miles over seven days, with vehicle support (i.e. we didn’t have to carry our stuff on our bikes). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since that first distance ride, I’ve criss-crossed Colorado two more times with </span><a href="http://cynthiaord.com/wp/blog/2014/06/05/what-every-beer-loving-cyclist-should-know-about-babrac2014/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BABRAC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, completed several 100-mile “century” rides, raised funds and rode far at the </span><a href="http://cynthiaord.com/wp/blog/2018/08/28/top-reasons-to-ride-the-colorado-courage-classic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Courage Classic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> twice, and rode the Tour of the Moon. At this point, I’ve logged more than a thousand miles of cycling on Colorado’s mountain highways. And I have the butt callouses to prove it.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-193 alignnone" src="http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/marathon-montage.jpg" alt="marathon montage" width="1000" height="398" srcset="http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/marathon-montage.jpg 1000w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/marathon-montage-300x119.jpg 300w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/marathon-montage-768x306.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2><b>I’ve done long runs before</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I went traveling abroad in places where road biking isn’t a safe option, I took up running. My first half marathon was the </span><a href="http://cynthiaord.com/wp/blog/2015/07/06/why-im-running-the-ethiotrail-half-marathon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethiotrail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in lakes district of Ethiopia in 2015. Once I got a taste of the runner’s high, I followed up with a half marathon in Granada, Spain in 2016, a half marathon in Denver in 2017, and another half in the Grand Tetons in 2018. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m no Boston qualifier, but I’m pleased to report that my finishing times have improved with each half marathon. It’s not as fun as cycling, but running has helped me maintain a good baseline level of fitness and build endurance. </span></p>
<h2><b>I’m signed up for a full marathon</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With four half marathons under my belt, I’m done with half-measures. I signed up for the full Colfax Marathon on Sunday, May 19. The idea is to train for that, which will double as my bike tour training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is, training for this marathon has been pretty lax. I’ll take the occasional 5-6 mile run around the park. There’s really no evidence that I can run for 26 miles straight. The goal is to finish without walking or injuring anything. Any knee-strengthening tips are welcome.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-195 alignnone" src="http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shakedown-ride_edited.jpg" alt="shakedown ride_edited" width="800" height="439" srcset="http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shakedown-ride_edited.jpg 800w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shakedown-ride_edited-300x165.jpg 300w, http://littlemissbiketour.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shakedown-ride_edited-768x421.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h2><b>I’ve heard that you train for this by doing it</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simulation only goes so far. There’s nothing quite like riding 50 miles a day for weeks on end, except riding 50 miles a day for weeks on end. I may start slow, but the route itself will whip me into shape. </span></p>
<h2><b>My Spin On It</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been preparing for this bike tour for over six months — financially, logistically, mentally, mechanically, and gear-wise. But I haven’t done much physical training. Yet. With only 54 days left, it’s time to get serious about getting in shape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I won’t be young for much longer. This trip was born from a sense of urgency to do something big with my body before the aging really starts to kick in. I longed for a way to push my body to its limits — all day, every day, outdoors, for an extended amount of time. I can’t think of anything better for my future-self to recall about “back when I was 35 years old …”</span></p>
