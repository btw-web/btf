<h2><b>Baker City, Oregon</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As evidenced by the dozens of positive reviews on her profile, Judy is a celebrity host in Baker City, OR. Here’s what I had to say on my review:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many things I appreciated about my stay at her house, but here are a few of them:</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; I got to take a soak in the clawfoot tub! Felt SO good on the bug bites and saddle sores.</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Sharing dinner and a beer in a nice local Baker City pub. She has done so much bike touring and has great stories to tell!</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Seeing Judy&#8217;s work-in-progress house and hearing its history. Great to see all the gallons of paint and love that Judy is pouring into it to make it her own. </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Hearing Judy&#8217;s plans for her current bike tour this summer. Very inspiring to see what she has created for herself, and I look to her as an example of how I&#8217;d like my older self to be!</span></i></p>

<h1><b>Reyna, Pat &amp; River</b></h1>
<h2><b>Grangeville, Idaho</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reyna and her family are a rare find in rural Idaho. I pitched my tent in their backyard and lingered in the morning. Here’s my review: </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phew! That climb up from White Bird up the switchbacks on Old Highway 95 was SO WORTH IT to make it to Reyna&#8217;s house in Grangeville. Her invitation to stay in their yard is what kept me going =)</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are just a few of the things I loved about my stay at Reyna&#8217;s:</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; The guest book! Made me feel part of a great community</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; The fresh naan &#8212; Reyna&#8217;s husband Pat knows how to cook</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; The shower and laundry, of course. I was getting pretty gross</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; The dog! I think Raven likes hosting travelers even more than Reyna lol. Will play fetch for days. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; The referrals to other super hosts along the route, like Curtis in Darby</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; The wonderful company on Sunday morning. Reyna and her husband joined me for coffee on the patio as I packed up my bike. We talked about all sorts of things, admired each other&#8217;s bikes, and we even weighed my fully-loaded rig! Felt like being part of a fun, spicy family. I&#8217;m staying in touch with Reyna and love to hear her story as she slowly but surely finds her way back to the bike saddle. </span></i></p>

<h1><b>Bruce</b></h1>
<h2><b>Missoula, Montana</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruce is a legendary host in </span><a href="http://littlemissbiketour.com/2019/07/03/missoula-montana-4-reasons-to-stop-at-the-aca-headquarters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missoula, Montana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (also the home of the Adventure Cycling Association). Here’s my review:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was like something out of a dream. Bruce opens his beautiful historical home to bike travelers in Missoula, MT. I spent my first night at the Shady Spruce hostel before I found Bruce&#8217;s house, and this was SO much better. Enabled me to stay an extra day in Missoula and cruise around town on an unloaded bike. Was a pleasure to meet Bruce and chat with him over breakfast. His housemate Patrick is an awesome co-host as well. FIND THIS SPOT in Missoula &#8212; Bruce is a hosting legend! </span></i></p>

<h1><b>Curtis</b></h1>
<h2><b>Darby, Montana</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than any other host, Curtis was involved with the community of other hosts across the USA. His signage is also worth checking out! Here’s my review:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curtis is so great! </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a big list of things I appreciate from my stay at his home. Here are just a few:</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; The maps of the USA and the World that show where all his guests come from</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; The warm shower, obviously &#8212; complete with a collection of toiletries for travelers</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; The customized signs in his yard and on his wall, just for Warmshowers guests</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; A wonderful homemade dinner with Curtis and his two housemates &#8212; felt like family!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Curtis&#8217; collection of maps and extensive knowledge about the upcoming portions of the routes</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Curtis&#8217; story! Fascinating guy with a lot of history and a big vision</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curtis even passed my name on to hosts farther down the route, making me feel part of a really special network of connected hosts.</span></i></p>

<h1><b>Mike</b></h1>
<h2><b>Pueblo, Colorado</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the closest-to-home Warmshowers stay, as my hometown of Denver is only about two hours away by car. Pueblo has a bad rap in my city, but this stay changed my mind about it.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike is a superstar host in Pueblo, CO! </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a great evening in Pueblo, where I got to see this small city from a local&#8217;s perspective. We shared a nice meal at a Mexican restaurant and took a stroll along the riverfront. Highly recommended for TransAm cyclists who want to explore this often-overlooked Colorado city. </span></i></p>

<h1><b>Jeanmarie</b></h1>
<h2><b>Toronto, Kansas</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeanmarie doesn’t have a Warmshowers profile. She’s more into the real-life crossing of paths. In her small town of Toronto, </span><a href="http://littlemissbiketour.com/2019/08/02/kansas-finding-a-daily-oasis-in-the-windblown-desert-of-grass/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cyclists often feel a little overheated, defeated, and blown around. If they make it to the Lizard Lips gas station, Jeanmarie will come to the rescue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open-minded, nontraditional, and fun-loving, Jeanmarie will change your assumptions about small-town Kansas. She takes each of her guests on a field trip to the nearby state park for a view of the lake at sunset. Staying with her is, literally and figuratively, a cool burst of air-conditioning on a hot and difficult road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to connect with Jeanmarie is to ask for her at Lizard Lips, or reach out on Facebook</span></p>

<h1><b>Jo &amp; Angelica</b></h1>
<h2><b>Utica, Kentucky</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jo and Angelica were another offline connection that made my time in Kentucky extra-memorable. They took me in when I was sick with a chest cold and helped me feel better with all kinds of remedies. Here’s my review:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angelica and Jo are the best-kept secret on the TransAmerica Trail! When the fire department in Utica was no longer able host cyclists, we were in a pinch. Luckily Jo and Angelica came to the rescue. We found their place from the handmade signs they posted at the food mart. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">They&#8217;ve built something really special for cyclists and anyone else in need of a safe space. Be sure to find them and their &#8220;Casa Encantada&#8221; &#8212; they will welcome you warmly and make you feel at home.</span></i></p>

<h2><b>Berea, Kentucky</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone following my blog during the ride knows </span><a href="http://littlemissbiketour.com/2019/08/17/berea-kentucky-artisan-workshops-a-tuition-free-college-and-fudge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I loved Berea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Wouldn’t have been the same without an insider and local like Maya. Here’s my review:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya is THE BEST host east of the Mississippi! </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She made it possible for me to spend a free day in Berea, wandering around the Artisan Village and taking it all it. Go say hi to her at the Visitors Center, where they have bicycle shirts for TransAm riders. She&#8217;ll tell you all about the history of Berea College and point you to the best eateries in town. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her house is the cosiest. We spend hours in the living room, just chatting about life, love and loss. I sifted through her guest book and her box of thank you cards from HUNDREDS of cyclists over the years. She is a superstar host. So grateful to have met her. </span></i></p>

<h1><b>Chrissy &amp; Dirk</b></h1>
<h2><b>Lexington, Virginia</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a wilderness orienteering sport called “rogaining”. You can travel by bicycle from Washington, D.C. to Pittsburg on Rails-to-Trails routes. These are just a few of the many things I learned from Chrissy &amp; Dirk. Here’s my review:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chrissy and Dirk were the final push I needed toward the end of my cross-country ride. Here are a few favorite parts of my stay with them:</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Joining them for a homemade dinner on the patio</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Hearing more about Lexington, its universities, and the history of their house! </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Washing my clothes and drying my shoes on their shoe-dryer</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Eating freshly-baked chocolate chip cookies as we talked about all kinds of things</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Seeing inside their their converted adventure-mobile van</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Getting ideas for my next bike tour from Dirk&#8217;s big upcoming mixed-terrain ride that was in the works</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart, funny, top-notch hosts. So glad to have met them!</span></i></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">My spin on it</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could write volumes about how much these hospitality encounters enrich bike touring as a form of travel, tips for being a better guest, tips for being a better host, how to pick hosts and send them requests, and how to show your thanks. I could write about how each of these encounters felt like a conversation with my future self, or a part of myself that I hadn&#8217;t met yet. There’s just so much to say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the afterglow of my recent tour, top priority is to write about each host before the details fade and hopefully point more guests in their direction. All of these folks are welcome to stay with me if they’re ever in the Mile High City! </span></p>
