<h1>Yes, I’m Doing This Alone</h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I’m not too worried about going solo</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I pitch my cross-America bike tour plan in conversation, I get some strong looks. “So you’re doing this alone?” Eyebrows either furrow with worry or raise with amazement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, I’m doing this alone. And yes, this prospect is both worrisome and totally badass. I have no problems defending this position. I’ve grappled with both the angels and </span><a href="https://matadornetwork.com/notebook/meet-four-monsters-solo-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demons of solo travel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on long-term trips before. Here are five perks and three downsides of going over 4000 miles for at least three months on a bike tour alone.</span></p>
<h2><strong>It’s an established route</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll be following the </span><a href="http://littlemissbiketour.com/2019/04/17/what-is-the-transamerica-bicycle-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TransAmerica Bicycle Trail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is one of the most well-established road bike routes on the continent. I like to describe it as “The Pacific Crest Trail of road bike touring”. I’ll strike out on my own, Cheryl Strayed-style, but chances are high that there will be other bike travelers leapfrogging me all along the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The route was first established by the Bikecentennial movement in 1976, which later evolved into the Adventure Cycling Association. This non-profit maintains detailed maps of a huge network of bike routes in North America, and the TransAmerica Bicycle Trail is where it all began. I haven’t found good data about the approximate number of cyclists that make this same cross-continental journey each year, but its popularity is as strong as ever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m counting on the TransAmerica Bicycle Trail to provide fellow bike tourists for doses of good company around the campfire now and then.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Warmshowers.com community</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One major draw to bike touring is that it has its own free hospitality exchange called Warmshowers. I’ve written about my great</span><a href="http://littlemissbiketour.com/2019/04/17/3-warm-exchanges-from-warmshowers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experiences as a Warmshowers host</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and now I’m ready to tap into the community from the guest side of the exchange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I plan to spend around 80-90% of nights camping, so I’m not counting on Warmshowers hosts every night, but it would be nice to meet the locals and hear their hosting tales occasionally during the trip. </span></p>
<h2><strong>I like solitary, introverted things</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following things sound fun to me:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting drawn into a good book</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing long-form blog posts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meditation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to podcasts on long runs or rides</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staring out into space, lost in thought</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One-on-one and small-group conversations</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following things do NOT sound fun to me:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big late-night parties</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling stuck with a group</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Networking events</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smalltalk</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team sports</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anything crowded</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myers-Briggs says I’m an INFJ. I say I don’t need constant socialization to feel energized or validated, but I’ll probably seek out some kind of interaction after enough solid days of navel-gazing on my own. Please excuse any rusty social skills during this solo journey.</span></p>

<h2><strong>I’m passing through Colorado</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TransAmerica Bicycle Trail passes through my home turf of Colorado, so I’ll have a chance to see close friends and family halfway through the trip. Three CO highlights to look forward to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll be organizing a camp-out near Breckenridge for any of my Denver friends who want to meet me for some roasted mallows</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I peddle as fast as I can, I’ll arrive on bicycle to a ranch in southeast Colorado in time for the wedding of my dear friends Alex and James</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone at home who wants to sample a day-in-the-life of my bike tour, I’ll be staging a ride-along from Pueblo, CO to Ordway, CO, complete with a hotel option. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Friends have an open invitation to join me</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to ride along with me somewhere along my USA route besides Ordway, CO? Do I know you and like you? Then </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="mailto:cynthia@littlemissbiketour.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get in touch</a>!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’m keeping my schedule flexible but I’m willing to coordinate with visitors. Self-supported touring gear is a plus; hotel points and credit cards also work for a few days of lighter touring.</span></p>

<h2><strong>The downsides of a solo bike tour</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every rose has its thorns. Here are a few aspects of solo travel on bicycle that I’m not looking forward to. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">More expensive</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re traveling in a group of two or more, you can pool your funds and split a lot of costs. Campsites, hotel lodging, and food are all cheaper when shared. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">More gear</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group can divide the weight of certain gear items amongst themselves, lightening the load for everyone. Meanwhile, I have to lug around my own tent, tools, and cookware. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">More work</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to carrying more as a solo rider, I’ll also be doing more. Setting up camp, packing it back down, scouting campsites, cooking, and bike repair are all assigned to me, myself, and I.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">More selfies</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of my biggest laments from solo travel is that the photos turn out lonelier. Either they have no people in them, or they’re taken by a careless passerby, or they’re selfies. Get ready, Instagram. My selfie arm and I will keep ‘em coming. </span></p>
<h2><strong>My Spin On It</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going solo on this trip was a very weighted decision. In the end, I value the autonomy of it and the fun of meeting people as an individual. Hopefully, solo won’t mean all alone all the time. </span></p>
