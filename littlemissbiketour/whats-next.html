<h2><strong>Summer 2020: RAGBRAI, Road Rides, and Gravel Rambling</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s some big news: </span><b>I got a job</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">real</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> job. A full-time, year-round, 9-to-5 office job. The two-weeks-accrued-time-off kind of job. While this is great news in a lot of ways, it’s not very conducive to season-long bike tours. At least not in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, a girl’s gotta dream — even if the dreams are downscaled from 2019. Here are a few ideas for weekend and week-long rides I’d like to do this coming year:</span></p>
<p><b>RAGBRAI</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual mass bike ride across Iowa has been on my radar for years. It’s been on Steve’s too. Steve is the pastor from Ohio who I had the pleasure of pedaling with for almost two weeks on the TransAm. When we parted ways, we made a goal of joining <a href="https://ragbrai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RAGBRAI</a> as a “reunion ride” in July 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven days, over 450 miles, thousands of people, and decades of tradition. Who’s in? </span></p>
<p><b>Road rides</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little-known fact: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blucifer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a little sister, a fancy new road bike that I got in 2018. This bike is for mountain road rides like the Courage Classic, BABRAC, and others I’ve done in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On weekends, the plan is to stay in good cycling condition by signing up for a few big ones, like the </span><a href="https://triplebypass.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Triple Bypass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Covering 120 miles and three mountain passes totaling 10,000 feet of ascent, this would be a new daily distance and climb record for me.</span></p>
<p><b>Gravel rides</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I pedaled the pavement and competed with vehicular traffic all summer, I had a recurring thought: “I’d like to do this offroad too.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not the only one. Bike touring on gravel roads and trails, also known as “bikepacking”, is blowing up in popularity. I’d need to add a gravel bike to my fleet and find a community as I get started, so I’ve picked out a few supported group rides in Colorado to try it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://ramblerides.com/2020fcwr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramble Ride</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a four-day, women-only gravel ride that starts and ends in Fort Collins, Colorado and loops through one of my favorite wilderness areas in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more ambitious would be the </span><a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/guided-tours/van-supported-tours/2020-great-divide-colorado-alpine-van/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great Divide Colorado Alpine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a ten-day segment of the full Great Divide Mountain Bike Trail that runs from Canada to Mexico. I’ve found a supported group tour of this segment, which I think would be great preparation for … </span></p>

<h2><strong>Summer 2021 or 2022: Great Divide Mountain Bike Trail </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve read much of this blog, you know I love classic, well-established routes that are adventurous and continent-spanning as well. That’s how I chose the TransAmerica Route. How to top that? The Great Divide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This route — covering 2,774 miles between Canada and Mexico along the Continental Divide — officially made it onto the bucket list when I saw the documentary </span><a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/blog/all-the-feels-watching-lael-wilcox-in-i-just-want-to-ride/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Just Want to Ride</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It will take me awhile to build up the skill, gear, free time, and savings for this, so I’m shooting for somewhere in the next two to three years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>January-April 2023 or 2024: Cairo to Cape Town on the Tour d’Afrique</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we’re looking </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">way</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ahead now, let’s talk about age. I just turned 36 last week, and in a few days we’ll be ringing in a new decade with 2020. The new year makes me extra-contemplative about the passage of time and how little of it we really have on this great green earth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2023 I’ll turn 40 years old, which I know will come loaded with strong feelings about aging and loss of youth, paths taken and not taken, etc. Turning 30 wasn’t pretty for me, and in order to avoid another crisis, I want to make the next decade’s milestone a grand celebration and even grander challenge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two months ago, I had the honor of </span><a href="http://littlemissbiketour.com/2019/11/15/paul-spencer-will-pedal-around-the-world-including-oceans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interviewing Paul Spencer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Pedal Round the World about his upcoming globe circumnavigation by bicycle and pedal boat. He told me about one of the biggest, best bike tours he’s ever done — the 7,500 mile </span><a href="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/tour-dafrique"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tour d’Afrique</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So I started researching it for myself, and it struck me. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This. Make this happen.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happen (planned or not) is life, in all its confoundingly wild and unpredictable ways. Who knows where I’ll be, what I’ll be doing, and who I’ll be doing it with between now and 2024. But for now, these are my bike travel goals for the next five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There. I told the Internet and set my intentions. First step: complete. </span></p>
