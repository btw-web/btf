<h1>Bikepacking the Superstitions, AZ.</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bikepacking.net/routes/gila-river-ramble/">Gila River Ramble</a>, just south of Phoenix, Arizona, is a multi-day mountain bike route concocted by Scott Morris, resident expert on all rides Arizonan.</p>
<p>The word &#8216;ramble&#8217; is a somewhat modest definition for the steep, rocky grades involved, the lofty ridge rides, the precarious, whirligig switchback descents, and the endless singletrack alleyways that wend through forests of giant saguaro and clumps of prickly choya cacti. Despite its mild-mannered title, think more along the lines of weekend epic than casual saunter&#8230;</p>
<p>Still, there&#8217;s no doubt it&#8217;s a wondrous part of the state to explore on two wheels. The mineral-rich landscape is in every way a match for the riding on offer; rocky jeep tracks, hewn from sheer sided canyons, link one abandoned mining settlement to the next. Imposing red rock buttes and mesas, along with the ever-craggy Superstition Mountains, complete the scene. This is rugged desert riding at its finest.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the Gila River Ramble combines a backbone of the <a href="http://www.aztrail.org/at_about.html" target="_blank">AZT</a> with a knot of jeep tracks between Kelvin and Florence. There are various interconnecting trails to choose from, depending on time &#8211; and in our case &#8211; weather. As misfortune would have it, our 4 day trip coincided with an unexpectedly robust and persistent rainstorm, that soon washed away all preconceptions we had for a warm and dry winter escape&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>The Bikes</strong></p>
<p>Joe rode: his <a href="http://www.englishcycles.com/" target="_blank">Rob English</a>, that cleverly dislocates into two for easy air travel, as he was flying in from New York.</p>
<p>Gary rode: his custom <a href="http://www.ampeircecycles.com/" target="_blank">AM Peirce</a>, fitted with a &#8216;dinglespeed&#8217; &#8211; yes, just two gears. He only used one.</p>
<p>I rode: my mighty <a href="http://surlybikes.com/bikes/krampus" target="_blank">Krampus</a>, complete with goliath tyres.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is definitely a ride where packing light pays dividends; we all sported bikepacking soft bags (<a href="http://www.porcelainrocket.com/" target="_blank">Porcelain Rocket</a> and <a href="http://www.revelatedesigns.com/" target="_blank">Revelate</a>) to best enjoy the singletrack riding.</p>
<p>Gary and I ran tubeless tyres, Joe loaded his inner tubes with sealant &#8211; a must in this prickly part of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Surly Krampus (Update)</strong></p>
<p>This was my second bikepacking trip on the <a href="http://surlybikes.com/bikes/krampus" target="_blank">Krampus</a>, and one that reinforced how much I enjoy riding this beast of a bike on a multi-day ride. The extra heft of those <a href="http://surlybikes.com/parts/knard_29" target="_blank">3in Knard</a> tyres didn&#8217;t prove problematic, handsomely compensating with their bonus grip (both up and down) and their rock-muffling prowess. I didn&#8217;t miss a lack of a suspension fork, nor did my back. I did, however, suffer one cut on the rear tyre &#8211; the rocks on the AZT are known for their blade-like sharpness &#8211; but thankfully it didn&#8217;t penetrate the casing, and looks to be holding out just fine.</p>
<p>The only real issue I ran into was the chain to tyre clearance, at least with the 1&#215;9 setup I was running. The chain runs extremely close to the tyre when shifted into the last cog &#8211; a 36T in my case -and has a tendency to pick up mud and sling it both into the rear derailleur and the front chainring. Bad news. If I was running an <a href="http://surlybikes.com/parts/category/drivetrain" target="_blank">MWOD or OD</a> double, I could avoid using that last cog as much for the gear range I needed. As it is, I&#8217;ll soon be converting to a Rohloff, which should eliminate the issue altogether.</p>
<p>To be fair though, these were the kind of foul conditions that would probably have made a meal of any derailleur system, single, double, triple or otherwise.</p>

<p>All the necessary gpx files to download can be found at <a href="http://www.bikepacking.net/" target="_blank">bikepacking.net&#8217;s</a> Gila River Ramble web page, along with navigational cues and waypoints for all important water spots &#8211; not that this was an issue for our sodden ride.</p>
<p>We started our loop at the Gila river crossing east of Florence, linking Kelvin (no food or water) and Superior (all services), returning via Box Canyon.</p>
<p>Between the three of us, we used a concoction of Garmins and iPhones &#8211; <a href="http://www.gaiagps.com/" target="_blank">Gaia</a> is an excellent offline topo app and well worth the $20 download fee. Unless you have a dynamo and a dust/waterproof phone case to hand, a handlebar mounted GPS unit makes for fluid riding and is far more efficient in terms of battery usage. The user-friendliness, the interface of a smartphone offers a better sense of the whole ride, making for easier tweaks to the tour if needed.</p>
