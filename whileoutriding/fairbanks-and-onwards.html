<h1>Fairbanks and onwards&#8230;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">We&#8217;ve now leap-frogged our way up to Fairbanks. We have Mike, who works with robots in the Air Force&#8217;s bomb disposal squad, to thank for our comfortable and speedy ride here, after he picked us up in Palmer and drove us all the way to Fairbanks. There can&#8217;t be too many places left in the world where two guys, two bikes and ridiculous load of luggage can get a 5 hour ride within an hour of sticking out a sign made from a pizza box&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_390" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-390" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-390" title="DSC_5133" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/07/dsc_5133.jpg" alt="One hour later, we were speeding to Fairbanks. " width="400" height="266" /><p id="caption-attachment-390" class="wp-caption-text">One pizza down and an hour later, we were speeding to Fairbanks.</p></div>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">It&#8217;s an exciting moment, as it&#8217;s here that the journey really begins. Our off road loop of the Kenai was superb, but wasn&#8217;t actually on the route. Now it&#8217;s time to get rolling. Daniel has to be in Montana by the end of August, and I need to get cracking on the Great Divide Mountain Bike Ride to clear Colorado before it&#8217;s too cold and snowy.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">From now, we&#8217;ll keep riding towards an ever later sunset – I&#8217;m writing this at midnight and there&#8217;s still plenty of light to read by. Logistically, it seems easier to ride the gruelling Hall Road north to Prudoe Bay, and then try and hitch a ride back to Fairbanks, rather than the other way round. Hopefully enough people will see us struggling away over the next week to offer us a lift when we backtrack – avoiding the $280 ticket for the shuttle bus.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">The journey here was a good chance to see what we have in store for us when we head south to Denali. It&#8217;s the scale of the wilderness that&#8217;s overwhelming. So few settlements; when they do appear, blips along the endless yellow paint strip that divides the road, they&#8217;re little more than a tyre repair shop, a gas station, a few rusty trucks, and perhaps a timewarped motel. “This place has a way of making you feel small,” commented Mike.</p>
<div id="attachment_402" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-402" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-402" title="DSC_4834" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/07/dsc_4834.jpg" alt="Alaskan 'junk'.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">The grandeur was a relief after our ride out of Anchorage, working our way through its ugly sprawl of industrial estates and malls, onto its busy highway. Thankfully there was a cyclepath, even if our conversation was drowned up by the constant drone of heavy traffic.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">These kinds of days are the the ugly underbelly of touring, the tedious slogs along busy roads to escape cities, the parts of a long trip we generally filter out from memory, or simply shut our eyes and sleep through on a bus journey. But these segments also lend bike touring its depth; it isn&#8217;t just the highlights of a country, it&#8217;s everything in between. They&#8217;re part and parcels of the highs and lows that, like the roads we follow, challenge us both physically and mentally. Luckily it only takes a small encounter or a breathtaking view to lift the spirits once more – or in our case, a free extra iced bun in a bakery on our way to Wasilla&#8230;</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">From what we&#8217;ve read, the Haul Road is both challenging and remote. There&#8217;s little to be found along its 400-odd mile length, much of which is gravel, muddy or potholled (for instance, there isn&#8217;t a single grocery store). Hopefully we&#8217;ll be back in Fairbanks within a little more than a week. In the meantime, thank you for reading and leaving comments &#8211; they&#8217;re always nice to read. And thanks especially to everyone in Anchorage who&#8217;ve offered advice, a yard to sleep in or spare parts to get us on the road – including Alan, Sage, Adam, Eric and Greg. You&#8217;re hospitality and kindness are much appreciated.</p>
