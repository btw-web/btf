<p>Missoula: not a spicy Indian curry but a town I&#8217;ve long hankered to visit, famed as it is for its bike-friendly layout, liberal tendencies and hippyish vibe. It&#8217;s also home to the <a href="http://www.adventurecycling.org/" target="_blank">Adventure Cycling Organisation</a>, pioneers of the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route I&#8217;ve been following. And, best of all, it boasts mile upon mile of fine singletrack spiderwebbing right out from its backyard. What more of an excuse could I need for a detour?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always admired co founder Greg Siple&#8217;s black and white portraits of touring cyclists, so was delighted to be photographed by him. Unfortunately the gravitas of my pose was somewhat undermined by the fact that I only had my bike helmet and rear wheel with me, as proof of my cycling credentials. I&#8217;d had to leave the Santos in Seeley when I hitched over (thanks Raine!), bringing my rear wheel with me in the hope of getting the Rohloff cog flipped over, to help prolong its life.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a great bike scene going on in Missoula. Dave and Kevin, who I&#8217;d met in Columbia Falls at a house party, lent me a cruiser for the day so I could blend in seamlessly with all the cool cats. Experienced mechanics, they&#8217;d recently set up their own bike shop, breathing life back into quality old bikes before selling them on. And a great setup they have too. Their <a href="http://www.hellgatecyclery.com/" target="_blank">website</a> has some absolutely gorgeous photos taken by Tom, a Missoula based photographer who put me up for the night.</p>

<p><span style="line-height:19px;font-size:small;">Visiting Missoula was also a welcome chance to meet up with Aaron Teasdale, the art editor of Adventure Cycling magazine, which I&#8217;ve been contributing to. It was great to hang out, talk bikes, swap ideas and get the lowdown on Missoula. We only had time to slip out for a late evening spin in the local hills before he headed out of town, but it was enough to convince me to stay another day&#8230;</span></p>
