<h1>A new plan</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s something of a relief to have figured out a plan amist all the options, which have been clouding my mind of late. And a fine one it is too, I think.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve actually (strangely enough) revelled in everything the recent snows have brought with them, I&#8217;ve decided, in light of the onset of an early winter, to veer off the <a href="http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes/greatdivide.cfm" target="_blank">Great Divide Mountain Bike Route</a>, and make my own way south. It was a tough decision, as I&#8217;ve loved almost every mile of this epic route so far; the quiet solitude, the complete remoteness, the oddball towns. In a way, this whole trip hinged around a desire to ride this route; it&#8217;s hard to accept change and let go of things sometimes.</p>

<p>But at least riding these gravel roads the last month has opened up a whole new world of backwater America to me, and it&#8217;s one I want to keep exploring. A conversation with David&#8217;s neighbour Evan rekindled my ideas of heading to Moab, by reminding me of the <a href="http://www.blm.gov/ut/st/en/fo/moab/recreation/mountain_bike_trails/kokopelli_s_trail.html" target="_blank">Kokopelli Trai</a>l. Then, the kind folks at Teton Mountaineering poured over map after map with me, and together we wove together a network of gravel and backroads which will deposit me right down at Fruita, on the edge of Colorado &#8211; a renowned mountain biking locale. Places along the way include Alpine Junction, La Barge, the Flaming Gorge, Jensen, Dinosaur and Loma, via Baxter Pass, if it&#8217;s doable.</p>
<p>From there, I&#8217;ll pick up the Kokopelli Trail, a challenging off road route I&#8217;ve long hankered to ride, which will link me to another mtb mecca: Moab, in Utah. Then, (somehow) I&#8217;ll weave my way back down to New Mexico, again on backroads where I can, and pick up the Great Divide Route once more to the border.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure to miss the phenomenally detailed route maps I&#8217;ve become used to. Many of these forest tracks I&#8217;ll now be following south should be just as remote, so, taking a leaf from the <a href="http://www.adventurecycling.org/" target="_blank">Adventure Cycling Association</a>, I&#8217;ve spent the morning at Staples compiling detailed topographical state maps from DeLorme, and highlighting where I&#8217;m going. I&#8217;d thought of laminating them for that final professional touch, but a zip lock bag will have to do.</p>

<p>Jackson seems mellower and less austentacious than I imagined, though I guess ski season &#8211; and the money that comes with it &#8211; has yet to kick in. The main square has a resort feel to it, and many of the stores are clad in the veneer of the log cabin or frontier town look. The fruit at the local supermarket seems perhaps a little more buffed and shiny than normal, and there&#8217;s a rather grand fireplace there too. But apart from that, Jackson seems to have kept to its roots as a beguiling, laid back mountain town, its roads populated by Subarus and pickup trucks loaded with the mountain person&#8217;s paraphernalia of skis/kayaks/bikes. The backstreets are quiet, with simple and elegant contemporary houses interspersed with old, wonky wooden buildings.</p>
<p>I like the vibe.</p>
