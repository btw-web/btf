<h1>Zacatecas to Guadalajara, Jalisco</h1>
<p>I’m now headed for the coast, and have stopped off along the way in Guadalajara, Mexico’s second largest city. We&#8217;re not down to three riders &#8211; Anna has set off towards Puebla to work with a street kid foundation, linked to the one she was with in Brazil for three years.</p>
<p>Normally I’d give a metropolis this size a wide berth. Guadalajara seems well worth the detour though, as it sounds incredibly progressive in its bike culture. Every Sunday, much of the heart of the city is closed to traffic – a chance for pedestrians, cyclists and roller bladders to reclaim the streets.</p>
<p>The last few days have seen us climb back up into the mountains on a mixture of paved and dirt roads. We hit some bad weather too, holing up in the forlorn mountain settlement of General Joaquin Amaro, seeking refuge from the downpours that froze us to the bone. Unfortunately we couldn’t avoid taking a few major highways. The constant whoosh of cars, trucks and buses streaming by was a good reminder of why, if you value your well being, it&#8217;s well worth tracking down the quiet backroads and forgotten dirt tracks in Mexico.</p>

I’ve sent almost 4kg of kit ahead to Puerto Escondido, on the coast in Oaxaca. Mexican internal post is extremely cheap; it only cost about 5 dollars. Apparently it’s reliable…</p></div>

In fact, having descended a few hundred metres from Zacatecas on the highway, it was a warm evening. The warmest in some time. We soon climbed back up to 2400m in General Joaquin Amaro and felt coldness bite again. </p></div>

Perhaps it was the rain, but the villages seemed to have the same cold, lifeless feel as those in Chihuahua - which also shares a similar drug scene.</p></div>

The lady who made us stomach-filling gorditas told us about a women in town, Julia, who rented out a room. Camping didn&#39;t appeal, so we knocked on the door and a head popped out of the window. Yes, I have a room, said Julia. How much is it? asked Jeff. Barratissimo, she replied. Very cheap. But... there’s no bathroom, she added. Ah, said Jeff. So what do we do for the toilet? he asked. She shrugged… Indeed, the room was basic, but it kept us dry, and relatively warm, for which we were thankful. And there were three massive beds, including the LoveBed, which Jason crashed out in. Even stealth-loo worked out ok in the end.</p></div>
<div style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/p1100608.jpg" border="0" alt="P1100608" width="400" height="267" /><p class="wp-caption-text">It rained and rained. By the time we’d emerged onto the streets after napping in our room, the place was all but dead. So we cooked up dinner on the floor with the coke can cooker. Gourmet cuisine. </p></div>
<div style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/p1100610.jpg" border="0" alt="P1100610" width="400" height="267" /><p class="wp-caption-text">In the morning, we caught the interest of the local schoolgirls, who told us we had bonitos ojos – beautiful eyes (!) – and asked to have their photo taken with us.</p></div>

This track was a real find, all thanks to the Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes maps, which have opened up a whole new world of off road options. </p></div>
<div style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/p1100680.jpg" border="0" alt="P1100680" width="400" height="256" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Finally, we broke out onto the finger of a ridge, taking in the distant barrancas – canyons - before us. Unfortunately we chose the wrong way at one of the unmarked junctions, and spiralled right down to a smallholding, only to be pointed back up the climb again by the surprised farmer.</p></div>

Originally, we’d planned to push further on into the mountains, but the weather had got the better of us.

Mezcal is similar to tequila – it’s made also made from agave. But like Champagne in France, tequila can only be so named if it’s from the state of Jalisco, next on our journey. </p></div>

A pickup pulled over, and the sombrero-toting farmer enquired as to what we were eating. When I told him, he nodded in approval, waved cheerily, gunned the engine back to life and was off.</p></div>
<div style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/p1100931.jpg" border="0" alt="P1100931" width="400" height="267" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The downside of avoiding the main highways is that you have to give yourself up to the lay of the land.</p></div>

Up and down. Each massive climb onto a mesa was answered by a descent, until we hit the highway once more. Back on pavement, the road was busy and narrow at times, but at least riding on a Saturday felt relatively quiet. Just before Xtlahuacan, I was pulled over by the police. After an initial barrage of questions from the Federale - the officer seemed pleased I could handle them in Spanish - he turned to practising his English. And to more important matters, it seemed.  “The woman in Guadalajara... They are the most beautiful in all of Mexico,” he assured us. “And they are…” for a moment, it was hard to tell if he was lost for words, or whether the English was escaping him. Then he simply made a curvaceous shape with his hands, and his young sidekick, a man in aviator shades who&#39;d been scrutinising Jason&#39;s guitar case like it might be a concealed weapon, nodded in agreement.</p></div>

Again and again. Still, we were making good progress, and were now in Jalisco, home of mariachis, rodeo, the mexican hat dance, tequila and the broad-rimmed sombrero.</p></div>
