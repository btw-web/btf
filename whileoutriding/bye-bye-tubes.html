<h1>Bye bye tubes: going tubeless on the Surly Krampus.</h1>
<p><em>July &#8217;13 Update: </em></p>
<p><em>The tubeless conversion has held out great. Lots of miles ridden, both with bikepacking gear and in my local, rocky trails. No issues at all. Since then, I&#8217;ve used the same method to run a Rabbit Hole with my Rohloff hub, and then swap out a set of Schwalbe Smart Sams (29&#215;2.25) for the Knards and fit them to my Ogre frame &#8211; using the same 24&#8243; inner tubes I&#8217;d already sliced. In hindsight, it&#8217;s probably best to leave a little more of a &#8216;skirt&#8217;, so it&#8217;s easier to reuse the inner tube again. </em></p>
<p>More semi-nerdish gear talk, I&#8217;m afraid. A persistent cold and rattly lungs have delayed my travels plans &#8211; I&#8217;ll be heading off for a few days of Arizonan bikepacking very soon though, hopefully returning with a story or two to tell.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;ve been inspired by nearly-neighbour <a href="http://gypsybytrade.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/tubeless-moonlander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gypsy by Trade</a>, and his pursuit to fine-tune his tubeless fat tyre conversions. Nick and an ever growing legion of fat bike riders are doing goathead-battle along Albuquerque&#8217;s river trails. They seem to be winning.</p>
<p>When it comes to prickly things, Santa Fe isn&#8217;t so different &#8211; indeed, the same could be said for the whole of the South West. Devil&#8217;s eyelashes, as goatheads are more poetically called (not that there&#8217;s anything romantic about them) mine the bike paths around town. It&#8217;s not uncommon to discover a dozen of these vengeful thumb tacks clinging tenaciously to your tyres, should you inadvertently stray off trail. To avoid a lifetime of patching inner tubes peppered with puncture wounds, you can inject in a few globs of sealant. If a goathead or thorn worm its way through your tyre, this sealant reacts with the air, plugging the hole. A few strokes of bike pump and you&#8217;ll be ready to roll again.</p>
<p>Better than this though, for various reasons, is moving over to a tubeless tyre system. To anyone unfamiliar with the concept, it&#8217;s basically a tyre that doesn&#8217;t require a separate inner tube to hold its pressure. Instead, the bead of the tyre presses against the lip of the rim to create a seal, secured in place with the addition of some sealant.  Again, puncture = air, and air = seal. Clever stuff. There&#8217;s several brands around to choose from, the most popular being <a href="http://www.notubes.com/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stan&#8217;s Notubes</a>. You can even make your own with stuff like liquid latex, water and glitter. Whichever brand you use, you&#8217;ll need to top up your tyres occasionally, as the sealant dries out over time. A small price to pay for a puncture-free existence.</p>
<p><strong>Homemade</strong></p>
<p>Most mountain bike tyres and rims nowadays are designed to be run tubeless. Even if they&#8217;re not, there are  various official conversion kits to help you. None exist for wide rimmed fat bikes as yet &#8211; such as the Krampus I&#8217;m now riding. Thankfully, this homemade conversion is surprisingly straightforward, as the <a href="http://surlybikes.com/parts/knard_29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knard</a> bead and <a href="http://surlybikes.com/parts/rabbit_hole" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rabbit Hole</a> rim play particularly nicely together. In fact, although more fiddly than simply throwing in a new tube, I&#8217;d say it proved easier than my recent endeavours to convert the Ogre, using one of Stan&#8217;s expensive tubeless conversion kits.</p>
<p>Compared to running tubes with sealant, the perks of tubeless riding include a slight loss in rotational weight, which is always welcome. But it&#8217;s the puncture-proofing them aspect that interests me the most. Inner tubes filled with sealant works ok-ish, but they&#8217;re nothing like as effective as a proper tubeless setup. This is just as well, as heavyweight Knards (1200g or so) have a large, grippy tyre patch, and have a habit of hoovering up goatheads and other prickly flora.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, a tubeless setup promise lower tyres pressures without fear of pinch flatting, translating into better grip and a more comfortable ride. I&#8217;d even go as far as saying that tubeless tyres are such an improvement that it&#8217;s hard to go back to tubes once you&#8217;ve tried them &#8211; only the fact that they rule out changing or rotating tyres easily deters me from running them while long distance touring.</p>

<p><strong>Touring tubeless</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned, the downside to tubeless is that it&#8217;s a fiddly process to swap tyres, or rotate them, as you might do on a long journey. For shorter tours though, they make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Tubeless tyres are more prone to sidewall failures than regular ones, so it&#8217;s worth knowing what to do in an emergency situation if you’re going light and not carrying a spare. Here’s Minimal Master <a href="http://whileoutriding.com/2012/03/20/minimal-master-garys-bikepacking-gear-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary’s</a> advice:</p>
<p>&#8216;I carry a heavy needle with some dental floss for thread and a couple of the Park TB2 glueless tyre boots for smaller cuts, which will cover most repairs. For longer, 2-3 ” long for gashes, I add I cut a section of sidewall cut out from an old tire, using Shoe Goo (you can get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eclectic-Products-110132-Specialty-Sealant/dp/B000BQWKH4/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357481729&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=goo+glue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1oz tubes</a>) to glue the boot in after sewing the cut.  Let the glue dry overnight with the tube in place; just a bit of air to hold pressure on it – I’ve not had a cut so bad that I couldn’t wait till night to do this.  Usually you can just use a Park boot and maybe sew it up. I carry superglue to hold the cut together – this isn’t an issue with tubes as it’s easy to get inside and boot it.  The Saguaro I was using on our trip had 2 spots with minor cuts.  I just covered the cut area with Shoe Goo and let it sit on it’s side overnight.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>Gary&#8217;s update:</strong></p>
<p>&#8216;Shortly after I wrote the advice above I came across the <a href="http://www.genuineinnovations.com/bicycle/accessories/tubeless- tire-repair-kit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tubeless plugs</a>, or ropes. I highly recommend them. They work really well for punctures that are too big for the sealant but not so big you need a boot. I’ve used them twice, once on my tire and once on a friend&#8217;s and it worked great both times. It seems to be a permanent repair too. I also now carry a curved needle so I can sew the outside of a sidewall without removing the tire.&#8217;</p>

<p><strong>Thanks to</strong></p>
<p>Dave and Mark at <a href="http://www.mellowvelo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mellow Velo</a>, Santa Fe&#8217;s sharpest bike shop, for use of tools and compressor. I was able to benefit greatly from Nick and Jeff&#8217;s R&amp;D at <a href="http://www.twowheeldrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2WD</a> in Albuquerque &#8211; which made this conversion far more straightforward than it might have been otherwise.</p>
<p>Any more tips? Please let me know.</p>
