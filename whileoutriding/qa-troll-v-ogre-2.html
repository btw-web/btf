<h1>ASK: Troll v Ogre</h1>
<p><strong></strong><br />
<em style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Reading your comments on the benefits of 29′er as an off road touring bike with a rigid fork are interesting. I’ve been planning a Troll for that same purpose (with Rohloff and a coil sprung 100mm fork + Old Man Mt front rack). Given the choice between the two–a 29′er with rigid fork or 26″ Troll with a 100mm coil sprung fork for off road touring, having ridden both, which would you pick and why. Thanks in advance for your thoughts. Carl</em></p>
<p>Carl, as is probably evident, I’m a big fan of 29ers, largely thanks to how smoothly they roll and how assuredly they corner. I find big wheels more confidence inspiring too &#8211; I feel less likely to go over the handlebars when mountain biking. And, being 6&#8217;1&#8243;, they also seem more in proportion to my own tall, lanky frame.</p>
<p>To some degree, which of the two is better for you might well boil down to where you are planning to tour: there’s no doubt that outside of the US/Europe/Australasia, riding a 29er takes more forward planning. It means choosing suitably burly rims, keeping a close watch on your wheels and having replacement tyres sent out &#8211; or at least carrying a spare. During my travels in Latin America, I&#8217;ve noticed many larger cities are picking up on the 29er revolution &#8211; but you&#8217;ll still need to hunt them down, and I expect it&#8217;s a whole different ball game in Asia and Africa. 26&#8243; wheels, on the other hand, are to be found in all but every hardware store the world over. And while it&#8217;s true that if push came to shove, you could throw in a 26in wheel and limp on, it&#8217;s hardly ideal.</p>
<p>In terms of big wheels, there’s also less touring-worthy tyres to choose from in the first place. Schwalbe are finally expanding their range, which now includes a 2in Mondial, and a 2.25in Smart Sam, and there&#8217;s some sturdy mountain bike tyres around, like Geax&#8217; Saguaros. Still, the options are considerably more limited.</p>
<p>These factors are definitely worth considering, especially for longer journeys in far flung destinations, or those where you’re especially heavily laden and torturing your wheels.</p>

<p>When it comes to pure dirt road touring ‘performance’, I personally prefer the way a rigid fork and a big wheel/large volume tyre feel, compared to a suspension fork teamed with 26in rubber. I like its directness. And, a rigid fork is also happier carrying a load.</p>
<p>This said, there’s definitely a trade off in out and out plushness – ultimately, a rigid 29er is still passive in its form of suspension. This can be especially noticeable out on the trail, particularly after a few days of hard riding. Adjusting tyre pressure regularly is key, but even that can&#8217;t match a 100mm of suspension.</p>
<p>For the kind of riding I do, I feel the pros outweigh the cons. Most of the time I’m carrying a relatively light load, or pulling a trailer. Making do without front suspension means less to worry about, coupled with the fact that the options for coil sprung models suitable for touring are dwindling fast. As a footnote, my titanium handlebars probably take out a little of the sting, as do the Ergon GP1 grips I like to run.</p>
<p>In any case, I’d definitely suggest trying out a 29er if you can before making your choice, and seeing what you make of it. The Ogre and Troll are both very nicely thought out bikes, and there&#8217;s plenty of overlap between them. Sometimes too much choice leads to a paralysis of indecision. If I hadn’t had access to the Ogre, I’d have been more than happy continuing on the Troll. As it is, my personal preference hedges towards its big brother.</p>
