<h1>The good, the bad and the beautiful: dirt roading the Nicoya Peninsula</h1>
<p>For the cyclist, there&#8217;s good and bad news.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get the bad stuff out the way&#8230; The northern swathe of the Nicoya Peninsula is overdeveloped with resorts and pocked with private, gated communities, foreign-owned complexes completely cut off from the local settlements around them.</p>
<p>In the dry season dust can be a real issue, particularly in the parched climes of the north. This wouldn&#8217;t be so bad, but for the fact that few of the rental SUVs tearing around the peninsula have the consideration to take things easy and slow down a little. I guess a relaxing holiday only goes so far&#8230;</p>
<p>Yet despite all this, the Nicoya is home to undeniably one of the most beautiful, endless strings of beaches I have seen. With some local insight, it&#8217;s possible to find lesser used, smoother dirt tracks, that are amongst the most enjoyable I&#8217;ve ridden on this whole journey. Even the beach itself can be cycled at low tide, which makes touring here unique.</p>
<p>Heading south, the coastal roads become calmer and calmer, and a more Costa Rican atmosphere prevails &#8211; even amongst the foreign communities which seem more integrated into their surroundings.</p>
<p>Like the rest of the country, it&#8217;s expensive. Luckily, away from the tourist centres, you can camp almost anywhere &#8211; there&#8217;s kilometre upon kilometre of empty beach where you&#8217;ll find nothing but the stars and surf for company. That&#8217;s just the ones I saw. For every beach I detoured to there were half a dozen others I had to forgo, hidden down winding dirt tracks that beckoned to be explored.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to be overly negative, but the reality is that at its worst, the Nicoya Peninsula is hellishly dusty and Gringo-fied.</p>
<p>At its best, it promises some of the finest dirt road touring imaginable.</p>

Andy, from the UK, is a self confessed bird-spotting fanatic. He was touring around Costa Rica for three months on his folding Brompton, and travelling impressively light. With its emphasis on wildlife sanctuaries, this country is a birders paradise, though as Andy pointed out, you need to budget in a wad of extra cash for park and private reserve entry fees.</p></div>

You buy up chunks of a foreign countrys land. This pushes up property prices beyond the reach of locals. Then you completely segregate yourself off from the existing community.

Nicoya&#039;s gravel thoroughfare can be biking hell. My triple nemeses: corrugation, a speeding SUV and its inevitable, accompanying cloud of dust. Incredibly, some drivers even waved as they past, foot pressed firmly to the floor. Do people lose all contact with the world around them once they get into the cocoons of their cars?</p></div>

This said, I still experienced small acts of kindness all the time. This Tico was selling cold coconuts from the back of his locally-made trailer. &#039;Pipas&#039;, as they&#039;re called here, are ideal bike food, a great nutritionally rich way to rehydrate. After we chatted, swapping notes on what we enjoyed about cycling, he wouldnt accept any payment, insisting I accept a second coconut instead.</p></div>

I&#039;d met him earlier that day in Playa Samara, where we&#039;d chatted a while. Ray &#039;got&#039; what I was doing, and asked a stream of questions about the ride and my impressions of life on the road. His invitation was simple and genuine: &#039;I can offer you dinner at my home, a place to sleep, breakfast and before you continue on your journey.&#039; True hospitality. </p></div>

We sat and savoured the view, stretching over a sea of green-hued foliage to the Pacific waters beyond. &#039;All this peninsula once belonged to Nicaragua. Perhaps thats why I feel so happy here,&#039; said Ray. His easy warmth and kindness really lifted my spirits, just when I was feeling a little disconnected with everything around me. I remarked to him that Nicaraguans seemed more open than Costa Ricans. &#039;When you have nothing, what else have you got to lose?&#039; came his reply. </p></div>

It&#039;s important to left the baby find its way down to the sea, as females migrate to their natal beaches. If youre wondering about the ethics of human intervention, its human activity thats to blame in the first place. Sea turtles, which are threatened by extinction, run the gauntlet of being caught in fishing nets, colliding with boats and having their habitats disturbed by commercial development. </p></div>

Unfortunately the main highway was closed to traffic, so I was joined by a perpetual flow of cars and buses crawling their way up and over the mountain. Often I had to pull over to take a breather from the exhaust fumes. As darkness fell, I camped in a coffee plantation, watching the unabated snake of lights below me. It&#039;s at times like this that I despair at the amount of vehicles in the world. </p></div>
