<h1>Digital Nomad; processing and backing up images on the road.</h1>
<p>Given that I aim to fund my travels as best I can by working from the road, I carry a relatively vast collection of electronic devices. It&#8217;s by far the heaviest part of my setup and somewhat at odds with the rest of my ultralight gear &#8211; but a necessary burden when I&#8217;m away for so long.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of what I use, the programs I like, details on my travel work flow, and some advice on backing up images.</p>
<div id="attachment_33560" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.whileoutriding.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_8783-2.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-33560" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-33560 size-full" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_8783-2.jpg" alt="IMG_8783 2" width="1200" height="800" srcset="http://www.whileoutriding.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_8783-2.jpg 1200w, http://www.whileoutriding.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_8783-2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.whileoutriding.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_8783-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.whileoutriding.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_8783-2-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-33560" class="wp-caption-text">Apple&#8217;s Macbook Air&#8217;s packs a real punch for its weight. Battery life and build quality are excellent.</p></div>
<p><strong>Hardware: </strong></p>
<p><em>Canon 6D, 24mm f/2.8, 40mm f/2.8, 70-200mm f/4</em>: Yes, it&#8217;s a heavy system, but the image quality is great, and I love the low light benefits of a full frame camera. If I was starting afresh, I&#8217;d look at weather resistant mirrorless cameras, like the Fuji XT-1, which seems to rule the roost in terms of the image quality/build quality/size ratio. Or for a smaller setup still, Olympus&#8217; excellent OMD series.</p>
<p>Day to day, the camera lives in my Carradice saddlebag, which sits on a Nitto front rack, and hangs off the handlebars &#8211; for details of the setup, see <a href="http://www.whileoutriding.com/gear-reviews/gear/carradice-supper-c-saddlebag-back-to-front-review" target="_blank">here</a>. The camera nestles in a minimal case, on top of a layer of clothing, with lenses to either side. When needed, a waterproof liner keeps everything dry. I tape up my camera and cover logos, to both protect if from scuffs and to help lend it an old and beaten-up look.</p>
<p><em>MacBook Air 11in</em>: Very powerful for its weight (1kg). Slim. Its solid state drive is extremely robust. Mine is a couple of years old, and it&#8217;s survived both drops and being shaken around over the roughest of roads. And, it fits in my XL Pugsley/Krampus framebag (a perk of being tall). It&#8217;s stored in a homemade case, constructed from pieces of Thermarest Ridgerest for extra padding, inside a dry bag in my framebag. If I wasn&#8217;t writing so much, or I was heading out on a shorter trip, I&#8217;d probably downsize to a tablet. But as it is, it&#8217;s really useful to have a laptop.</p>
<p><em>1 x Western Digital My Passport Ultra 1TB</em>: Short of being dropped, these hard drives seem very reliable, in as much as any non solid state hard drive can be. I&#8217;ve used several in the past, and never had any problems &#8211; they&#8217;re also cheap and readily available. The hard drive is stored in a padded case, in a dry bag within my seat pack.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/upgrade" target="_blank">Dropbox Pro</a> 1TB storage</em>: £79 ($99) for the year. A complete set of online backups will eventually supersede the need to carry a more fragile hard drive. £79 a year seems like good value for peace of mind. And, it saves weight! I&#8217;ve also set up Dropbox to automatically sync all my documents whenever I&#8217;m online, providing a backup, and allowing me to access them from other devices.</p>
<p><em>2 x San Disk Extreme 64GB USB 3 flash drives</em>: Blazing fast, super reliable and tiny. I use these for a second round of backups, or to store other media. There are now 128GB and 256GB flash drives available too, which is crazy given the size.</p>
<p>When I have them, I place a bunch of silica gel packets amongst various electronic bags, to help keep dampness and humidity at bay.</p>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong></p>
<p>To get the most out of my images, I shoot in RAW &#8211; the difference in quality is worth the extra processing time, especially if you like to have more control over your images.</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html" target="_blank">Lightroom 5</a> to process RAW images. It&#8217;s quick and easy to use. Setting up a series of processing presets helps give photos a &#8216;look&#8217; and sense of continuity, and saves time in front of the computer screen. I&#8217;ve made up my own series of presets, based on <a href="http://vsco.co/film" target="_blank">VSCO&#8217;s</a> excellent film emulation collections. Lightroom is an excellent program that has a bunch of useful tools, one of my favourites being the Spot Visualizer and Spot Remover, which are excellent for tidying images taken with a dusty sensor. I also carry one of Giottos&#8217; <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/318545-REG/Giottos_AA1910_Rocket_Air_Blower.html" target="_blank">Rocket Blasters</a>, which helps dislodge most particles of dust from sensors.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re happy writing on a tablet (which are becoming ever more powerful), <a href="http://connect.dpreview.com/post/7236815772/raw-processing-on-android-with-photo-mate-r2" target="_blank">Photo Mate R2</a> looks like a good RAW conversion option, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Snapseed</a> is popular too. On an iPad, I&#8217;ve heard good things about <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/photogene-4/id363448251?mt=8" target="_blank">Photogene</a>.</p>
<p>I keep a backup of all the edited files on my hard drive. As I mentioned above, I&#8217;m slowly uploading all of these to Drop Box, with the eventual aim of having a full copy of images stored online, in both RAW and high res JPEGs &#8211; so I&#8217;m not reliant on carrying my computer all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Editing:</strong></p>
<p>After importing images into Lightroom, I set about culling those I&#8217;m not happy with to save on disc space. Then I process the images to taste, making sure the RAW files are piggybacked with the xtml file (you can set this up in Preferences). I then batch rename the images according to where they were taken or the set they&#8217;re in, always preceded by the Year/Month/Date. This makes tracking down images a lot easier later on; it&#8217;s well worth the initial effort.</p>
<p>eg: 150208_cotopaxiloop_01.</p>
<p>I convert one set to 1200px jpgs, compressed for web use (my Tumblr site&#8217;s default size is 1200px). These can be easily emailed or uploaded to the likes of Instagram. Being obsessed about backups, I also make a second high res version saved at 3MB in size, which I upload to Dropbox when I get the chance. Same goes with the RAW images &#8211; whenever I stay in a hostel with a good internet connection, I upload these overnight.</p>
