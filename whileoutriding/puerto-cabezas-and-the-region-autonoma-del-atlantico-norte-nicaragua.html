<h1>Puerto Cabezas and the Region Autonoma del Atlantico Norte, Nicaragua.</h1>
<p>This next instalment in my catch-up posts follows on from the <a href="http://whileoutriding.com/2011/02/08/ahuas-to-morocon-singletrack-via-coco-la-moskitia/" target="_blank">Moskitian Adventures</a>. It covers the ride south from Mocoron (Honduras) to (Granada) Nicaragua, a distance of some 800kms, most of which is on rough, remote dirt roads.</p>
<p>This seldom visited area of Nicaragua is known as RAAN &#8211; Region Autonoma del Atlantico Norte &#8211; and it&#8217;s home to a cultural melting pot of Creole, Mestizo and indigenous groups, including Miskitos. I had to detour into its capital, Puerto Cabezas, to get my passport stamped, as the immigration office was closed on the Honduran border.</p>
<p>A ramshackle, sketchy Caribbean port, Puerto Cabezas is infamous as a stop off for cocaine smugglers working their way north from Colombia. I don&#8217;t like to overdramatise things, but drug running is definitely a big part of life in these parts. The town felt fine during the daytime &#8211; plenty of friendly smiles and waves &#8211; but it&#8217;s not somewhere I&#8217;d feel comfortable roaming at night.</p>
<p>As an example, one Roatanian living in this area told me about a high speed chase with a blacked out US Apache helicopter, along the coast at night. He claimed in the right conditions, the boats &#8211; effectively superlight hulls with a row of outboard motors bolted onto the back &#8211; could do 80 knots. During the chase, he was unable to escape the beam of the Apache&#8217;s search light despite pulling his best moves, so finally had to ditch the boat and its cargo of cocaine on the beach and disappear into the night&#8230; &#8216;I don&#8217;t do that anymore. It&#8217;s too stressful now I have a family. I just build fibreglass boats in the peace and quiet of the forest&#8230;&#8217;</p>

A huge thank you to Anita and Legia for teaching me how to open a coconut like a man, wash my clothes (properly) in a river, and all their laughter and smiles.</p></div>

Crossing from Leimus into Nicaragua was straight forward &#8211; just a dollar for the crossing in a dugout &#8211; albeit under a heavy downpour.</p></div>

We&#8217;d first bumped into each other in La Ceiba, from where he&#8217;d taken a cargo boat to Puerto Lempira. We ended camping out together and staying in the same cheap digs for the next few days.</p></div>

It was all grown locally and tasted incredibly fresh. As I worked my way through the bowl hungrily, the owner of the <em>comedor</em> joined me, a farmer who ran the restaurant to help supplement his income. He&#8217;d seen a couple of touring cyclists pass by before and having chatted to them, had clearly been cogitating about bike touring. &#8216;Rare is the man who really knows the world. You can&#8217;t understand life from a car or plane. But on your bicycle, you see and experience everything,&#8217; he said.</p></div>

To give you some idea how slow going it can be, it takes the bus 24 hours to cover that distance&#8230; That&#8217;s an average of around 23 kilometres an hour.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_0510.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dsc_0510.jpg" alt="DSC_0510.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">And here&#8217;s one such bus. Fast and Furious, reads the livery. That must be a relative term round here&#8230; We crossed one of the rivers together (on a boat tugged by a chain) and everyone on aboard gathered round to find out what I was up to, and wish me luck for the road ahead.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_0554.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dsc_0554.jpg" alt="DSC_0554.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">No wonder, with extended parts like this. If I put in some long days in the saddle, I figured I could make it in six days to colonial Granada, quieter and safer than the capital, and a little under 600kms away. It would mean some long (and painful) hours in the saddle.</p></div>

This particular stretch rattled my brains and loosed my fillings. Not to mention giving me a sore backside. Sometimes I could seek rattling sanctuary from slivers of smoothish trail along the very edge of the road, riding faster than the transport trucks that deliver supplies to Puerto Cabezas.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_0733.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dsc_0733.jpg" alt="DSC_0733.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The area felt settled in the daytime, but I was told to be off the road before nightfall. I didn&#8217;t run into any trouble, but I did pass through a small community close to Rio Blanco where three men had been held up killed just five days before, at three in the afternoon. &#8216;Are you worried about travelling along?&#8217; was a question I was often asked. In fact, while I always received a warm welcome whether I went, the constant barrage of warnings crept into my subconscious and became unsettling.</p></div>
