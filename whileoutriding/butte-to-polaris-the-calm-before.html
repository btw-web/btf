<h1>Butte to Polaris: the calm before&#8230;</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m now a stone&#8217;s through from Jackson, Wyoming. First though, here&#8217;s a couple of catch-up blogs from the lux lounge of the Signal Resort while I camp down the road!</p>
<p>So, to recap. After a night in the opulent Super 8 motel (and prolonged all-you-eat breakfast), Robert and I took for the trails once more. Chris still had errands to run in Butte, fettling with his bike and trailer setup, before investing in a whole new wardrobe of toasty clothes to fend off this unexpected onset of chilly weather&#8230;</p>

<p>By the way, I think I&#8217;ve fractured my hand in a mountain biking incident in Missoula. While riding a lovely ti Co Motion hardtail, I endoed down a concrete flight of stairs. My excuse? The brakes were set up the American, &#8216;wrong&#8217; way. Several days later, my hand swelled up like a puffer fish, so much so that I had to coax it into my winter gloves. &#8216;Vitamin I&#8217; helped bring the swelling down, though there&#8217;s now a sizeable, hard lump in its place..

<p>Needing to catch up for lost time, we pushed on over the pass, and after a fast, chilly descent, holed up in Grasshopper Creek. Seems another storm is brewing&#8230;</p>
