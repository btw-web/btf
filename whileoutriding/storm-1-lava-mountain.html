<p>Here&#8217;s a little picture story on the first of our snowy adventures&#8230;</p>
<p>After kicking back and relaxing over at Dan&#8217;s in Bozeman &#8211; and squeezing in a couple of short but sweet singletrack rides &#8211; we set off once more from Helena. Bt the way, thanks enormously to those who sent parcels or answered my music SOS and compiled new tunes &#8211; I&#8217;m loving them!</p>
<p>It had to happen some time. With weeks and weeks of sunshine in the bag, the forecast finally spelled doom and gloom. Sure enough, when we awoke from a night camping in a (closed) campsite, early morning drizzle was pooling in the potholes and giving the trail a lovely, tyre-sucking, tacky feel.</p>
