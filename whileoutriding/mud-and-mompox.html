<h1>Mud and Mompos</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve now reached the riverside settlement of Mompos. Strung out across the banks of the Magdalena, this colonial river port was once an important staging post for the transport of gold and goods between the interior and the coast. Now it&#8217;s contentedly living out its retirement as a laid back, pleasantly dishevelled town, just awkward enough to reach from Cartagena to keep it that way.</p>
<p>The journey here was an eventful one, following first the main highway towards Medellin, then a slippery, sliding trail through the remote, inaccessible ranch country of El Salado, once a FARC (Colombia&#8217;s revolutionary army) stronghold, and sadly infamous for the massacre by paramilitaries that took place in 2000. After my lap-of-luxury<a href="http://whileoutriding.com/2011/04/20/sailing-around-the-darien-gap/" target="_blank"> sailboat crossing</a> from Panama (which I&#8217;m still getting guilt pangs about), this &#8216;short cut&#8217; definitely satisfied my fix for discomfort, stretching out a three day ride into four. Reaching the town itself involved crossing the swirling eddies of the Magedalena on a wonderfully slow, ponderous ferry, the perfect filter to life&#8217;s usual clammer and clatter, unplugging Mompos from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>I like it here. Even if time hasn&#8217;t quite stood still, it&#8217;s definitely dialed back a couple of notches. Mompos&#8217; searing midday heat, its grand, crumbling colonial houses, a cast of characterful locals and its sleepy, forgotten air lends itself to a location in a Marquez novel &#8211; which it&#8217;s believed to be, as the setting for the Colombian author&#8217;s Chronicle for a Death Foretold.</p>
<p>The roads, flitting between buckled pavement, dust and stone, are quiet and mellow, home to bicycles, trikes, wandering cattle, horse and carts, and the rattle of motorbike taxis. The street corners are well stocked with mounds of sweet  mangos and neat stacks of pineapples. There&#8217;s little more to do than wander the backroads, sit beneath the umbrella shade of ceiba and knotted orejero trees, or join the locals in watching the world go by from the meditative comfort of a rocking chair.</p>

The terrain here is gently rolling and beautiful, marred only by heavy truck traffic that thunders by.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_7643.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/dsc_7643.jpg" alt="DSC_7643.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Enormous, land-of-the-giant avocados, range in price from 500 pesos (25c) to 4000 pesos (over 2 dollars), depending on taste and texture subtleties I have yet to decipher. I picked up one of the cheaper versions, and it was good enough for me.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_7680.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/dsc_7680.jpg" alt="DSC_7680.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The heavy traffic on the road to Medellin, which came in spits and starts, was getting me down. At El Carmen, I left the others and turned off onto this dirt track - carretera despatada, as unpaved roads are called here - to the tiny settlement of El Salada. </p></div>
<div style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_7706.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/dsc_7706.jpg" alt="DSC_7706.jpg" width="299" height="450" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Perfect riding conditions. Although relentlessly steep and hot in places, it was all but empty.</p></div>

Note still-clean tyres.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_7733.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/dsc_7733.jpg" alt="DSC_7733.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Only motorbike taxis and a few jeeps travelled this road. Some stopped to warn me that if rain should fall, the whole area would quickly become an impassible mudpit...</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_7758.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/dsc_7758.jpg" alt="DSC_7758.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">After El Salida, where I was stopped and quizzed at the army base, it was easy to see why. The road deteriorated rapidly, and was no longer drivable in anything but a burly tractor.</p></div>

<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_7788.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/dsc_7788.jpg" alt="DSC_7788.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Once rain fell, the trail instantly become a slippery quadmire, as foretold. Making it up this short, steep incline alone took me the better part of twenty minutes. I struggled to push the bike forward half a metre, before sliding back on my heels, resting, and repeating. Had anyone seen me, they&#039;d probably have spotted a mad glint in my eyes. And they&#039;d probably have laughed at the comic element of my toils, knowing there&#039;s a perfectly good paved road just thirty kilometres away...</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_7833.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/dsc_7833.jpg" alt="DSC_7833.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Before long, the &#039;road&#039; was little wider than a singletrack. As I later found out, occasional vehicles do pass through in the dry season, winching their way up the steeper inclines. In the rainy season, not even motorbikes use these roads, and that&#039;s saying something in these parts. </p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_7876.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/dsc_7876.jpg" alt="DSC_7876.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I made the tactical decision to camp the night in the grounds of an empty ranch, hoping it would be drier by morning. In the middle of the night, I awoke to the sight and sound of an electric storm overhead, and a field flickering with hundreds upon hundreds of glow bugs, lighting the landscape up like an alien landing. Unfortunately by morning the heavens opened and my tent was soon floating in the middle of a marsh. Not ideal...</p></div>

After some time, Senor Ormedo Periz passed me by, and offered to carry my panniers on his donkey. If it wasn&#039;t for him, I&#039;d probably still be there...</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_7965.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/dsc_7965.jpg" alt="DSC_7965.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The river had also risen overnight, so his donkey had to be coaxed into swimming across.</p></div>

By this time, even without panniers, it was almost impossible to lift, thanks to its extra cargo of mud and tacky donkey shit. Still, those Surly Troll massive clearances were doing their job as best they could - only on a few occasions did I have to stop and scoop out great handfuls of muck to keep the bike rolling. Running disc brakes made a big difference too - now I just need to find wider racks...</p></div>

La Casa Amarilla, one of the finest hostels I&#039;ve come across, is very relaxed, packed with information and well priced. Both the interior and exterior of this former 18th Century warehouse have been beautifully converted and restored. I was particularly pleased to arrive, knowing I could rest sore muscles, wash mud-impregnated clothes and give my bike some much needed TLC. And right now there&#039;s a posse of eight trans-American cyclists here!</p></div>

<p>The Need to Know section:</p>
<p>Money-wise, it&#8217;s around 1800 pesos to the dollar at the moment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lacasaamarillamompos.com/espanol/La_Casa_Amarilla.html" target="_blank">La Casa Amarilla</a> is a great base in Mompos, and comes complete with all import Wifi, a lovely kitchen, a terrace, clean en suite dorm rooms (15,000 pesos pp) and space to store bikes. Even eight of them&#8230;</p>
<p>The national map institute of <a href="http://www.igac.gov.co/igac" target="_blank">Augustin Codazz</a>i, publishes an in depth road atlas of Colombia (13 000 pesos), which covers most of the backroad and dirt track options in the country &#8211; the layout is a little weird though. There&#8217;s also separate state maps, with even more detail, for 12 000 pesos each. There are Augustin Codazzi offices in each state capital; the one in Cartagena is in Plaza Bolivar, in the old city.</p>
