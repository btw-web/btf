<p>This might be the point where the really good stuff begins&#8230;</p>
<p>And, for that matter, the big climbs. This relatively short segment from Leymebamba to Cajamarca &#8211; just a few hundred kilometres &#8211; has managed to squeeze in a 30km climb, followed swiftly by a 60km descent, answered immediately by a 45km climb.</p>
<p>There were more passes still, but by then, my climbing calibration had been reset, and they felt like mere blips&#8230;</p>

Trust me, this was one bumpy. And then there was the heat. I kept to 8km/hr, but it was a hard graft. Divide 45 by 8, and you get a lot of hours.</p></div>
<p><strong>The climb:</strong></p>
<p>Hawk eyes scan the mountains for clues as to where the road might lead &#8211; some houses, a scratch on the hillside, a distant bus. A bus&#8230; what&#8217;s to stop my hand reaching out to flag one down, and being done with it all. It could all be so easy&#8230; I&#8217;m suddenly aware how ridiculous I must seem to its passengers. I mean, why?</p>
<p>Is it just ego that keeps me pedalling? A blunt, stubborn refusal to accept &#8216;defeat&#8217;? Or admitting it to others?</p>
<p>I believe I keep riding because cycling is the only constant &#8211; and it&#8217;s this that gives me mental strength and structure. Take it away, and I wouldn&#8217;t know when to ride and when not to. At what point would I stop? When would I push through and when should do I bail? Sometimes options only confuse matters.</p>
<p>So I try to relax and let my mind settle. Find a calm space. Persistent thoughts clatter around and around, like loose coins in a washing machine. But that&#8217;s ok, it&#8217;s part of the process. When things are good, spinning the pedals feels peaceful and meditative. Why stop? When they&#8217;re not, it&#8217;s an infernal, tortuous struggle, and I find an excuse to pause on every curve.</p>
<p>Regardless, the minutes go by, and so do the hours. I try not to look down at my cycle computer, but my eyes are drawn magnetically to it; checking my speed, appraising my average, constantly updating a string of numbers in my mind. Calculating and recalculating.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s an hour to go. I&#8217;ve crossed the hallowed line where arrival is inevitable. Then, half an hour left. Twenty minutes. I can see the last few switchbacks, the crest of the pass, the cell phone tower that promises it won&#8217;t be a false summit. A bus passes me and I smile, happy to be engulfed briefly in dust.</p>
<p>And then I&#8217;m there, at the exact place that has occupied my thoughts so obsessively; feeling the wind blow stronger, drying the sweat from my back. I look out into the beyond, taking time to acknowledge and appreciate this moment, understanding every ripple in the land that has got me here.</p>
<p>Just a brief moment of clarity, but one to savour.</p>

Gold No. Two lakes, sacred to some, will have to be drained as part of the project and there is fear of contamination to the ground water. Although mining has brought prosperity to Cajamarca, this wealth hasn&#8217;t filtered throughout the district, and is blamed for social tension to the area.</p></div>

He&#8217;d even biked all around Peru, and his bicycle was set up for touring, with a rack and panniers. Fully versed in a cyclist&#8217;s needs, he sat me down before giant platter of rice, chicken and potatoes, along with jam sandwiches, coffee and sweet apple tea.</p></div>

On a light 29er, pinch flats seem less of an issue, so taking the time to adjust air pressure really helped smooth out the ride. In fact, I&#8217;ve been running my tyres with far less pressure than I used to, helping the wheels float over uneven surfaces.</p></div>

<p><strong>The need to know bit: </strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty of water to be found on the climb out from Las Balsas, starting from 15km up. At 20km, on the fringes of Limon, there&#8217;s a restaurant with a well stocked shop.</p>
<p>Works is currently being carried out on the 20km stretch north of Celendín. It&#8217;s closed during the day to traffic, but not to bicycles, though you&#8217;ll have to weave your way through some heavy machinery.</p>
<p>Pavement starts at Ensenada, around 30kms from Cajamarca.</p>
