<p>Loaded up with a breakfast of sugary-coated cereal, then resting my backside gingerly on the newly-welded Brooks saddle, I bade farewell to my sunglass-toting hosts, Jim and Barbara in Manila. It was a long climb out of Flaming Gorge; hot and interminably rolling. A climb that forever seemed to lose as much altitude as it gained, it did finally breach the 8500 foot pass forty miles later. My original plans involved a dirt road detour beyond the top but in light of my damaged perch, I dove straight back down on pavement, finishing the day with a ten mile, ten switchback descent that unravelled almost into the backstreets of Vernal.</p>
<div id="attachment_1755" style="width: 469px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/test-1-231.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1755" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1755" title="test -1-23" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/test-1-231.jpg" alt="test -1-23" width="459" height="185" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1755" class="wp-caption-text">Ten blissful miles of descent.</p></div>
<p>The bike shop where I hoped to invest in a new seat was shut by the time I tracked it down on the fringes of town, so in a moment of wild abandon, I booked myself into a discounted room at the Sage Motel. Such indulgent luxury! As it happened, it was just the kind of independent motel I like. Cheap and quirky round the edges, it was run by a friendly Indonesian family, and when the back door opened, I caught a waft of Nasi Goreng.</p>
<div id="attachment_1703" style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/test-11.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1703" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1703" title="test -1" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/test-11.jpg" alt="Singletrack" width="460" height="305" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1703" class="wp-caption-text">Just a few miles from the main drag in Vernal, a web of trails criss-crossed the desert.</p></div>
<p>To be honest, I wasn&#8217;t expecting much from Vernal. But as it happened, it had just hit the big time in mountain biking circles, thanks to a magazine feature on its brand new network of trails within easy reach of town. I liked its desert heat and oddball feel; the enormous, surreal and almost cuddly dinosaurs poking their heads high into the clear blue sky, and the faded, classic Americana shop facades in the older part of town.</p>
<div id="attachment_1758" style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/test-1-27.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1758" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1758" title="test -1-27" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/test-1-27.jpg" alt="test -1-27" width="460" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1758" class="wp-caption-text">Blue skies in Utah. Thanks Troy at Altitude Cycles for donating me a saddle to keep me rolling. </p></div>
<p>Two other mountain bikers had booked into the same motel, brothers Jim and Tim from Salt Lake City; Jim a keen mountain bike racer and Tim an extreme distance runner, before fatherhood took over a chunk of their lives. Over at Altitude Cycles, owner Troy&#8217;s unremitting enthusiam for the trails he&#8217;d been working on inspired me to strip down the bike and spend a &#8216;day off&#8217; riding lovely, dusty singletrack out in the desert with the two brothers.</p>
<div id="attachment_1718" style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/test-1-23.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1718" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1718" title="test -1-2" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/test-1-23.jpg" alt="XXX" width="460" height="307" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1718" class="wp-caption-text">Jim throwing some moves in the desert. </p></div>

They invited me to join them for a day&#039;s mountain biking, then kindly treated me first to lunch, then to a gargantuan Mexican dinner. I slept on their motel room floor the second night - thanks guys!</p></div>
<p>So as often the case when travelling, a turn of bad luck was far outweighed by the experiences that came from it. Breaking my saddle rails resulted in a night at Jim and Barbara&#8217;s, and an impromptu stop in Vernal. Which in turn introduced me to Jim and Tim, whose company both on and off the trails I really enjoyed. &#8216;It&#8217;s a good earth&#8217;, said Jim. And I agreed.</p>
<div id="attachment_1731" style="width: 430px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/test-1-35.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1731" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1731" title="test -1-3" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/test-1-35.jpg" alt="In the afternoon, we squeezed in a ride around.

<p>Then it was time to load up once more and head south, via the dirt roads of Baxter Pass, which would lead me me over the mountain range into Colorado.</p>
<div id="attachment_1746" style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/test-1-92.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1746" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1746" title="test -1-9" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/test-1-92.jpg" alt="As I rode south to the wonderfully named Bonanza, the desert took on a surreal, wind sculpted quality.

<p>I would have had the valley to myself but for the profusion of hunters stalking the mountains for deer and elk, garbed in full camo gear, somewhat incongruous with their day-glo orange waistcoasts and baseball caps.</p>
<p>All the creeks had dried up, so I flagged down pickups and asked for water. Everyone quizzed me on where I&#8217;d ridden from, and what I was doing out in the middle of the mountains alone. When I told them, they forced out whistling sounds from their mouths and shook their heads. Just to temper their perception of my madness, I often added that there was a couple on a tandem homeschooling their kid, and two brothers on a similar journey, one of whom was towing his dog in a trailer. &#8216;Well, I sure as hell don&#8217;t blame him for that,&#8217; said one of the hunters, to unanimous nodding from his camo-clad friends, as if leaving a dog behind would have been far more of a surprise than the journey itself.</p>
<p>One couple asked me simply, &#8216;So what are you going to do when you get there?&#8217; It was a question no one had put to me before. &#8216;Er, fly home, I guess,&#8217; I answered, seeing in a moment of clarity how so many people must view this journey.</p>

For someone who&#039;s not been brought up in this kind of world, it was pretty gruesome watching him working away at the animal with his knife. But I figure that if I&#039;m prepared to eat meat, perhaps this is a more natural way of experiencing how it gets onto my plate, rather than neatly embalmed in a styrofoam packet, purchased from the disconnected convenience of a supermarket.</p></div>

To him, living off the land and understanding where your food is coming from form the essence of hunting - the size and majesty of the antlers comes second. To me though, I still find the &#039;trophy sport&#039; aspect of it - hunting for the thrill of the kill - hard to deal with. </p></div>

Then a howling wind stirred into life, threatening to blow me back up the hill. And the rock-strewn and washed out trail swelled out into a body jarring, filling-loosening washboard road. Both of which I were taking their toll on my spirits and energy supply. You can&#039;t see the two evils of bike touring in this picture, but they were there, believe you me.</p></div>

It did the iconic snake dance - raising itself up on the ground and bobbing its head from side to side...</p></div>

<p>Pedalling into such a formidable headwind, I didn&#8217;t make it into town until dark, and luckily ended up sharing a campspot in the overpriced State Park ($20 for a tent!) with Craig, Bonnie and Dean from Canada, who&#8217;d been mountain biking in twin meccas of Fruita and Moab.</p>
<p>All in all, it had been a great segment of the journey. One that had been incredibly varied: from snow to mud to dust to desert to highway, with some wonderful encounters in between. Next up is the Kokopelli Trail to Moab&#8230;</p>
