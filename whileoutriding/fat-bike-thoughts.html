<h1>Fat Bike Cogitations</h1>
<p><strong>Update: now with click-able big-able pictures!</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been cogitating a lot about fat bikes these last few months.</p>
<p>You might have spotted these larger than life, balloon-tyre bikes out and about &#8211; they&#8217;re all the rage right now, as riders branch away from using them specifically for Alaskan snow duties or desert crawling, to less weather-specific trail escapades.</p>
<div id="attachment_20971"  class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.whileoutriding.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DSC_48101.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20971" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-20971" alt="A titanium Fatback fatbike, photographed at the beginning of my trans-american journey, up in Alaska in 2009.

Tyres are typically over 3.8in wide, and can be run at absurdly low air pressures – down to 5psi – for crawling through snow and sand. More basic models weigh in at around the 35lb+ mark. I seem to remember this one was sub 28.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_21009"  class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.whileoutriding.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/MG_1559.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21009" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-21009" alt="The 29+ Surly Krampus.

Not as much float as a fat bike, but more lively on trails. The tyre diameter is actually a little larger than that of a 26&#215;3.8 tyre.</p></div>
<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve notched up a fair few miles on the semi-fat <a href="http://surlybikes.com/bikes/krampus" target="_blank">Krampus</a>, and although I&#8217;ve never spent much time on a &#8216;true&#8217; fat bike, I&#8217;m beginning to really see their potential. That&#8217;s not to say that extra wide, low pressure tyres are a requirement for backcountry adventures; more that something about them prods you into doing trips a little out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Before I was fortunate enough to get my hands on the latest Surly, I was on the verge of biting the bullet on one for the winter (and more) &#8211; inspired first by Jakub&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wildworks.co.nz/csr/home.php" target="_blank">Stock Canning adventure</a>, then by <a href="http://joecruz.wordpress.com/category/touring-on-a-pugsley/" target="_blank">Joe&#8217;s travels</a> through Latin America and Nick&#8217;s unorthodox journey <a href="http://gypsybytrade.wordpress.com/tag/touring-on-a-fatbike/" target="_blank">down from Alaska</a>, and now <a href="http://pocket-thunder.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Dirt Dot Kurt</a>. Further internet dabblings at <a href="http://fat-bike.com/" target="_blank">FatBike.com</a>, <a href="http://bigdummydaddy.blogspot.com/2012/12/tarik-saleh-bike-club-challenge-day-7.html" target="_blank">Big Dummy Daddy</a>, the<a href="http://thelazyrando.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/ode-to-my-pugsley/" target="_blank"> Lazy Rando</a> and <a href="http://coastkid.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Coast Kid</a> served only to seal the deal, as did campfire discussions with Nick and Joe. (The general media have even latched on now &#8211; like <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/01/20/169814506/welcome-to-alaska-where-winter-is-cold-and-bikes-are-fat" target="_blank">NPR</a>.) Anyway, I was all set to delve into the weird and wonderful world of offset frames, downhill bottom brackets and mammoth tyres &#8211; until the Krampus came along.</p>
<p><strong>(Update: More fat bike travel<a href="http://vimeo.com/57760011" target="_blank"> inspiration</a> from Kurt)<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>29+ v Full Fat</strong></p>
<p>The way I see it, the Krampus is a beefcake 29er, a bruiser of a bike, boasting bags of extra cush and extra grip. It&#8217;s a whole lot of fun to ride. Those 3in Knards are a definite advantage through rock gardens and they&#8217;re noticeably more confidence-inspiring through mild snow too. Certainly, it beats me up a whole lot less than my go-to rigid forked Ogre. But as much as I love riding it, I don&#8217;t see the Krampus as an attempt to match the roving omni terra abilities of a real fatbike. That&#8217;s the domain of a different beast altogether.</p>
<p>For now, I&#8217;m living vicariously through others. Jeremy just bought a <a href="http://surlybikes.com/bikes/neck_romancer_pug" target="_blank">Surly Neck Romancer </a>(more clever witticisms from the Surly peeps) so I joined him in collecting it from one of my favourite bike shops in Albuquerque, <a href="http://www.twowheeldrive.com/" target="_blank">Two Wheel Drive</a>.</p>
<p>The Neck Romancer is a marriage of sorts between the venerable <a href="http://surlybikes.com/bikes/pugsley">Pugsley</a> (the frame that helped popularise the movement) and the big foot of the fat bike world, the Surly <a href="http://surlybikes.com/bikes/moonlander" target="_blank">Moonlander</a> &#8211; in that it uses a Pugsley frame with a super wide Moonlander fork.</p>
<p>As far as I can decipher, it&#8217;s one of the most appealing, affordable way of getting into touring-friendly fat bikes. This year&#8217;s build kit includes weight saving cut out rims, plus a versatile Mr Whirly OD crankset and reliable Avid BB7 brakes. The finish is super stealth black, right down to the understated logos and spokes. And &#8211; having enjoyed a brief spin on it, I have to say I was really surprised by how fun it rides, despite its obvious heft.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not in the position right now to go custom due to financial constraints, so given my requirements, I&#8217;ve whittled down my virtual list to a Salsa Mukluk 2, a Surly Neck Romancer and a standard Pugsley &#8211; all of which are relatively easy to get hold of in the US. Importantly, all three have a generous allowance of eyelets and rack mounts for touring potential &#8211; ruling out On One&#8217;s new budget <a href="http://www.on-one.co.uk/i/q/CBOOFATX5/on_one_fatty" target="_blank">Fatty</a> for me. I don&#8217;t have enough experience to form concrete judgements, but these are my musings so far:</p>
<p><strong>Mukluk 2</strong></p>
<p>The 170mm rear symetrical spacing on the Mukluk appeals, as it lends itself to a second set of strong but light 29er wheels. The new frames can even fit Rabbit Holes and Knards. The downside? This requires investment in another 170mm hub, which doesn&#8217;t come cheap.</p>
<p>The aluminium frame is a touch lighter, and would be protected from rust ingress during a Baja Peninsula exploration, or corrosive salt on winter roads. The Mukluk 2 gets the all important cut out Rolling Darryl rims, a fancy e*thirteen crankset, an11-36T 10 speed cassette and 120tpi (ie &#8216;lightweight&#8217;) Surly Nates. All very nice bits of kit. But parts that also nudge the cost up to $2450&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Surly Neck Romancer/Pugsley</strong></p>
<p>The Neck appeals as I really like the way it rides. It&#8217;s understated, it&#8217;s chromo (which I still find myself drawn to &#8211; especially if it&#8217;s to be strapped to the roof of a Peruvian bus) and the built kit is particularly appealing &#8211; there&#8217;s nothing but the saddle I&#8217;d rush to change. An asymmetrical frame means no need for running spendy, awkward to source hubs &#8211; but makes building up a set of lighter 29er wheels more of a challenge. It comes with nice bits too, including the many talented Mr Whirly OD chainset, Avid BB7 brakes, cut out rims and Microshift thumbies &#8211; all for $1900.</p>
<p>Like the Mukluk, the Neck has 82mm Rolling Darryls, which is great for eeking out as much grip and float as possible from a 3.8in tyre. But it does mean it won&#8217;t play as nice with the likes of a Schwalbe Big Apple 26&#215;2.35, which would lend it more versatility for long distance touring. For that, a standard Pugsley, which uses narrower, 65mm Marge Lites &#8211; and comes in a wonderfully blunt yellow finish &#8211; might be best. The Pugs will set you back just $1650 &#8211; which I think is incredible value given how niche fat bikes and their components currently are (a complete Ogre is $1500, by way of example).</p>
<p><strong>Running costs</strong></p>
<p>For long distance touring, there&#8217;s a couple of factors worth taking into consideration. Not only are fat bike tyres heavy and hard to source, but they cost upwards of $90 each. While they&#8217;re good for many a mile on snowy adventures, they&#8217;re bound to wear considerably quicker on pavement and trail. Perhaps prices will drop as they become more popular, with the likes of the budget <a href="http://www.on-one.co.uk/i/q/CBOOFATX5/on_one_fatty" target="_blank">On One Fattie</a> joining the fray.</p>
