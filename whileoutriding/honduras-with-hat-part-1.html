<h1>Honduras with Hat &#8211; Running the gauntlet to La Ceiba</h1>
<p>Hat and I have been journeying along the Central American Caribbean coast in the runup to Christmas. Now though, her trip has come to an end and she&#8217;s winging her way back to the UK to spend a wintry Yule with her folks. With the UK under a blanket of snow, her next ride certainly won&#8217;t have any pineapple and coconut stops&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been mini-adventure packed times: running the gauntlet with goliath, hand-me-down American trucks on the road into San Pedro Sula &#8211; the second largest city in Honduras. Loading our bikes into a skinny, precariously bobbing fishing boat to connect a remote stretch of Garifuna-infused coastline. And sampling some sweet singletrack across the Sierra Nombre de Dios into La Ceiba.</p>
<p>As ever, it&#8217;s been great to have company. As I sit here chomping on my tuna/tomato/avocado/salsa sandwich (our staple lunch these last couple of weeks), I know riding alone again will take some getting used to. But I also know that the accompanying sense of independence (and vulnerability) is bound to lead to rich, interesting encounters, keeping me motivated for the road ahead in 2011.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there&#8217;s Christmas and New Year to look forward to, before heading on towards the remote dirt tracks and waterways of the Mosquito Coast&#8230;</p>

We stopped for a break along one. As Hat disappeared into the undergrowth to go to the loo, a trucker slowed right down, pointing into the palm plantation before making a rather melodramatic finger-across-throat gesture. I took it to suggest we shouldn&#039;t hang around there too long...</p></div>

There was barely any water dripping out of the tap, the corrugated roof was speckled with holes and shafts of dusty light patterned the walls. Six months ago, she&#039;d been robbed of her TV. Yet all this didn&#039;t stop Alba inviting two complete strangers into her home. </p></div>

Clarissabel had worked as a cleaner in New York for over thirty years, and in her broken english, subjected us to a blow by blow account of the complete contents of her thick tome of family photos. </p></div>
<p>In fact, Clarissabel&#8217;s children are still in the US, and send her back cash remittances so she can complete her half-built concrete home, a relative mansion in comparison to the wooden shacks on either side. She lamented the state of drug-rife Honduras, and offered an explanation with a religious slant typical to this part of the world. &#8220;Dios se enojo.&#8221; God has become angry because of people&#8217;s greed.</p>
<p>By way of example, she told us how a year and a half ago two women were gunned down almost outside her house. In fact, gun culture here seems even more prevalent than in Guatemala &#8211; it&#8217;s not uncommon to see a handgun nonchalantly tucked into a belt down at the juice bar.</p>

Nice to look at but not a spot for moonlit walks, according to the locals, who keep to themselves when night has fallen. </p></div>

Placards warned us to steer clear of the area when pesticides are being sprayed. Apparently Numegon (a soil fumegant) has been banned in the US since the &#039;70s, cited as a cause for infertility, cancer and birth defects, amongst others. </p></div>
<div id="attachment_5853" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_6719.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5853" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5853" title="DSC_6719" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_6719.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="299" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5853" class="wp-caption-text">The outskirts of La Ceiba, flanked by the impressive Sierra Nombre de Dios. The city was developed largely to serve the interests of Standard Fruit in 1924 - its owners, the Vaccaro brothers, dealt primarily in tropical fruit and steamships.  Their banana export business, along with that of United Fruit (now Chiquita), remapped the social landscape of Honduras, thanks to their acquisition of vast tracts of land - much of which they didn&#039;t actually need. This land wasn&#039;t returned to Honduran farmers until agrarian reforms in the &#039;60s - and even then, it was done with the interests of the banana businesses in mind. </p></div>
<p>It always takes a little time to find your feet in a new country. With national politics in turmoil after last year&#8217;s coup, and increased street gang activity, it sounds like safety in Honduras could be a little dicey at the moment. We&#8217;ve certainly been warned enough to take care by those we&#8217;ve met, though it&#8217;s hard to know just yet whether or not its really justified. So far, Hondurans seem quick to smile (or, in Hat&#8217;s case, whistle and catcall), and as welcoming as anywhere else I&#8217;ve experienced in Central America.</p>
