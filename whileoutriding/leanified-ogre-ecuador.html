<h1>Leanified Ogre; Ecuador</h1>
<p>In my obsession to jettison weight, the panniers have now gone. The theory? A light, sleek bike opens up a whole new world of dirt touring scope, as well as simply being more pleasurable to ride. Seek out singletrack. Bunny hop over obstacles. Shoulder your bike with (relative) ease. Go explore.</p>
<p>With my framebag/seatbag/handlebar bag combo, I still have enough room for a few days of food, with careful packing. Thus far, that&#8217;s realistically more than I&#8217;ve needed  &#8211; it&#8217;s rare to go hungy in Latin America, with some form of nourishment in almost every village in Colombia and Ecuador. And from what I&#8217;ve heard, this should be the case for a while yet, at least until La Paz, Bolivia. As a caveat, I should add that these days my cooking has lost most of its gourmet aspirations &#8211; travelling solo so can do that to you. A pack of soup with noodles and a can of tuna, plus some veg if I don´t have to haul it over a mountain &#8211; I keep things light, simple and quick, and save the big meals for roadside restaurants.</p>
<p>The good news is that thanks to this cull, I&#8217;ve managed to send back almost 4kg of gear. That&#8217;s a lot of heft to be carrying over each and every Andean pass.</p>
<p>Gone for now are my <a href="http://www.arkel-od.com/us/xm-28-touring-accessories.html" target="_blank">Arkel XM28s</a>.  Although they&#8217;ve proved to be very capable panniers &#8211; they&#8217;re tough, with a kung fu grip clamping system &#8211; they&#8217;re also not the lightest. The quoted weight is 1.4kg (I expect they&#8217;re a little more), plus there&#8217;s the waterproof covers to add in as well.</p>
<p>Sacrificed too is my tried and test <a href="http://www.ortlieb.com/_prod.php?lang=en&amp;produkt=ultimate5plus" target="_blank">Ortlieb Ultimate 5 bar bag</a>, which comes in at just under 700g &#8211; that&#8217;s over 2kg right there, before you&#8217;ve even started to fill them. Bar bags are great for road tours but for dirt trails, they push the weight further forward than I like, and the contents tend to rattle around. I know I&#8217;ll miss the Ortlieb&#8217;s complete waterproofing, which has been particularly beneficial in Ecuador &#8211; so fingers crossed for drier conditions in Peru. If you think I&#8217;m nitpicking grams, I compared typical weights back in <a href="http://whileoutriding.com/2012/04/03/bikepacking-the-joys-of-travelling-light-and-lean/" target="_blank">this</a> post, so you can see how all those little g&#8217;s adds up.</p>
<p>However, in their place, I&#8217;ll be wearing a lightweight backpack, carrying little more than my Macbook Air, which weighs in at a touch over 1kg. The cardinal rule in long distance bike touring is not to carry a backpack &#8211; let the bike do the heavy lifting. And it&#8217;s sensible advice. After all, even a light pack can strain your back eventually, not to mention leaving it sweaty and clammy.</p>
<p>But the more I tour, the more I find myself riding the style of trails where a light bike makes the difference between enjoying the experience, and trudging through it. And while I admit that I prefer not to carry a pack, I find it more tolerable when riding dirt roads and trails, where body position is less static than on pavement. When it comes down to it, riding riding offroad is what I aspire to do, and what this trip is about.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that going light doesn&#8217;t have its own set of compromises &#8211; space for food is limited, reducing range between resupplies. Packing is also more fiddly.</p>
<p>Whether I&#8217;ll live to regret this decision, we shall see. I still have a rear rack, so in a pinch, I can bungee on my pack for longer paved stretches, or use it to carry more food. My escape clause is my mum, who&#8217;s planning visiting me in Peru. I can always get my panniers brought back out (-;</p>

A light bike is a more fun to ride, plus you can ride quicker for the same amount of effort, and there´s less ware and tear on components. It&#8217;s certainly worked well over these last few days to the Peruvian border &#8211; a stretch famed for the poor conditions of its roads, and its lumpy terrain.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_5650.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc_5650.jpg" alt="DSC_5650.jpg" width="450" height="298" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">My Porcelain Rocket framebag is loaded with camera lenses, bike tools and spares, as well as camping fuel. A few snacks are crammed in there too. It&#8217;s a bit of a squeeze up front, but it works. Sleeping bag, potset, Tarptent, Thermarest and camera&#8230; The top tube pack has snacks, plus my headtorch, pocket knife, multitool and all important spork.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_5653.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc_5653.jpg" alt="DSC_5653.jpg" width="450" height="298" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">As much as I like my Ortlieb bar bag for its convenience, the Porcelain Rocket pouch is roomy enough to fit my camera and some padding. I&#8217;m hoping the front pouch will provide better protection over rough roads, as it rests on the sleeping bag and Thermarest.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_5652.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc_5652.jpg" alt="DSC_5652.jpg" width="450" height="298" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The seat pack is loaded with food and various electronics gadgets. And some clothes &#8211; which I have little of.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_5669.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc_5669.jpg" alt="DSC_5669.jpg" width="450" height="298" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;ve hung onto my Tubus rear rack. It&#8217;s only 600g, and is useful for carrying a spare tyre and my flip flops. I could strap my backpack on there too. Or even bail on pannier-less travel, and get some made locally&#8230;</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_5664.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc_5664.jpg" alt="DSC_5664.jpg" width="450" height="298" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;m running a Profile Kage with an 800ml water bottle on the Ogre&#8217;s forks, doubled up with a Porcelain Rocket Anything Bag &#8211; without Salsa&#8217;s Anything Cage. This has all my waterproofs/gloves/hat, so they&#8217;re easy to access.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_5662.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dsc_5662.jpg" alt="DSC_5662.jpg" width="450" height="298" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">This system works pretty nicely. The PR strap, which would normally wrap round the Anything Cage, feeds through the Profile Kage to stabilise it.</p></div>

If you have to wear a pack &#8211; which isn&#8217;t ideal, to be honest &#8211; the key is to keep it as light as possible and not be temped to overload it. Mine just has my Macbook Air (too big for my framebag) wrapped in a Patagonia micro puff jacket.</p></div>
<p>I´ll add in a complete kit list at some point soon&#8230;</p>
