It&#8217;s almost all unpaved, passing through remote villages, and is relentlessly up and down&#8230;</span></span></span></span></div>

The local kids were more interested in our bikes than the world&#039;s deepest canyon. </p></div>
<div style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" style="border:0 initial initial;" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/p1050824.jpg" border="0" alt="P1050824" width="400" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Seeing as Devisadero is also a stop on the scenic trainline (the Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacifico), a thicket of stalls have sprung up selling tourist trinkets and food. Here&#039;s my lunchtime snack: blue corn tortillas stuffed with tomato, vegetables, cheese and potato. </p></div>

Part of this streamlining includes investing in new home; I&#039;ve been trying out Jason&#039;s TarpTent while my own is on order. The Rainbow is a singleskin tent that will sleep two. The pack size is tiny, and it weighs less than a kilo, compared to my 2.5kg Terra Nova Solar 2. Should be ideal for the warmer climes ahead. </p></div>

After what felt like a bout of  interminable climbing, we were suddenly rewarded with sweeping views into Barranqua de Urique, one of the deepest canyons in the area. It&#039;s over 1800m from top to bottom. </p></div>
<div style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/p1050944.jpg" border="0" alt="P1050944" width="400" height="293" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Then began a steep, switchback descent down to a lowly 550m in altitude. </p></div>

Nowadays it seems quite affluent. I noticed that kids had nice new bikes, and even remote control cars. Crawling along the one way main street in a pickup or jeep seems to be the main pastime in the evening, beer in hand.  Shame. </p></div>
<div style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/p1050955.jpg" border="0" alt="P1050955" width="400" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Up Hill being the operative words. Urique is also famous in ultra endurance circles, for it&#039;s home to various races where Tarahumaras and international runners battle it out up and down the steep, rocky terrain of the canyons. Running barefoot or in sandals made from old truck tyre tread, the loincloth wearing Tarahumaras are fabled for being able to run hundreds of miles without stopping, using specialised breathing techniques so effective they can chase down deer. Almost completely injury free throughout their lives, they often run into their 80s and 90s. </p></div>

Pitch your tent, use the facilites (a kitchen, compost loos, wood-powered shower) and forrage to your hearts content in the organic gardens for 10 dollars. </p></div>

Here’s Jeff having a morning read. In fact, the article was on the drugs trade in the border area we&#039;d just passed through. Although I&#039;d never felt threatened in any away, it quoted a sobering fact: 14 000 deaths over the last three years, the vast majority of them unsolved. Many murders take place in Nuevas Casas Grandes, the town we’d ridden through just a few days before…</p></div>

And scramble for grip. Again, it doesn&#039;t look so bad in this picture. But believe me, it was...</p></div>

These birds were my alarm clock the next morning. </p></div>

Later that day, when I eventually reached the junction, I met a Mennonite family, wearing old fashioned plain, modest prairie clothing. Shane and Cindy had brought along their 5 kids, aged 2-10, to help friends of theirs working at the Mission Hospital. The family would be based out of this tiny, scruffy settlement for a couple of months - the kids were home schooled. And how long would their friends be there? &#039;As long as the Lord needs them to stay here,&#039; came the answer. </p></div>
<p><strong>The Need to Know Section: </strong></p>
<p>Distance &#8211; 242km. Creel to Urique is 160km, then it&#8217;s roughly 82km to Samachique. That&#8217;s only a guide, as I was riding (or pushing) too slowly for my cycle computer to function all the time&#8230;</p>
<p>Road conditions &#8211; paved to San Rafael, then dirt. It&#8217;s up and down pretty much all the time, and the road from Urique to Samachique is particularly rough and steep. Altitudes fluctuate between 2450m to 550m&#8230; Unfortunately, there don&#8217;t seem to be any decent maps of the area. On the ones we found, either these roads either aren&#8217;t shown, or are completely inaccurate. Likewise, there is a dirt road that goes all the way to Las Mochis which I have yet to see marked on a map.</p>
<p>Food &#8211; Plenty on the way to Urique (Devisadero, San Rafael, Babochivo). Very little between Urique and Samachique, though there is a well stocked shop in Corareachi (a tough 54km from Urique) and a friendly restaurant at Samachique.</p>
<p>Cheap digs &#8211; Plenty of places to camp in pine woods on the way to Urique. In Urique, don&#8217;t miss the wonderful<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~ramsay52/" target="_blank"> Entre Amigos</a>. After the first big climb back out again, no shortage of spots on the way to Samachique. A storm had swept in by the time I made it to Samachique, so I camped in the yard of the new restaurant there, not far from the grocery store &#8211; the friendly owner also had a cheap room for rent too.</p>
<p>Internet &#8211; Patchy but available in Urique. Entre Amigos has a satellite connection with wifi, as long as there&#8217;s electricity.</p>
<p>Recommended Reading &#8211; Bandit Roads: Into the lawless heart of Mexico by Richard Grant (best read after you&#8217;ve passed through the area), and Born to Run: A hidden tribe, superathletes, and the greatest race the world has never seen, by Christopher McDougall.</p>
