<h1>Central Cuba Loop</h1>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_5578-2.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_5578-2.jpg" alt="DSC_5578-2.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">In Cuba, colour combos abound. </p></div>
<p><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Cuba. </span></span><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.42cm;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">What an incredible country. What an amazing cycling destination. It&#8217;s hard to know even where to begin.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.42cm;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"></span></span><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">There&#8217;s much to report from just two weeks of travel. 21st century communist Cuba is a complex place, and a large part of independent travelling here has been simply experiencing and contemplating its socialist system: both the inspiring policies introduced with the Castro-led revolution of 1959 (like nationwide education and universal healthcare), as well as some of its obvious downfalls (lack of money/freedom of speech/travel). It&#8217;s not all clear cut though. For instance, Cubans contend with massive billboards evangelising the benefits of socialism, quoting nuggets of wisdom from past leaders and revolutionaries. But in return, they live in an almost advertisement-free world, far removed from Western-style consumerism and its own form of control. Away, as Che once said, from the &#8216;invisible cage of capitalism&#8217;. </span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.42cm;"><span style="font-family:Tahoma;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"></span></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Politics aside, its capital city, La Havana, is like nowhere else I have seen: both supremely elegant and decidedly run down. The people we&#8217;ve met on our travels have invariably been warm and hospitable. At night, when the air is filled with music, when bars flow with rum and young men loiter in doorways, its streets still feel noticeably safe. There are </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"><em>casas particulares </em></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-style:normal;">(Cuban B&amp;Bs) everywhere, serving up platters of lobster, fish, chicken and fresh fruit to fuel you on your way. Except for a couple of challenging mountain belts for those in search of Alp-like climbs, the terrain is relatively flat. Ok, so there </span></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"><em>can</em></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-style:normal;"> be brutal headwinds to contend with, but if you pick your route carefully, you should get through pretty much unscathed. And did I mention those crystal clear Caribbean and Atlantic waters? They&#8217;re the perfect way to wash away sweat and temper the midday heat. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.42cm;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">For the cyclist, it helps that its roads are all but empty of cars. Money-tight Cubans are masters of reinvention and for the most part, people travel in old Russian trucks, or by horse and makeshift cart, or homemade bicycle taxis, recycled from old bike and motorbike parts. Pre-embargo classic are crammed with passengers, </span></span><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"></span></span><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">and even the tiny, boxy Ladas have been stretched into surreal limousines. I&#8217;m convinced that this lack of traffic empowers communities, reclaiming the roads as a place where people can gather in the evenings and kids can play freely. Certainly, Cuba really comes to life in its streets. </span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.42cm;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"></span></span><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">All in all, the more we travelled in Cuba and the more people we talked to (which isn&#8217;t always the easiest thing to do), the more we realised what a complex country this is. And the more we wondered about how it possibly gets by. Modern Cuba is undoubtedly founded on noble ideals. Under the strain of a trade embargo and without the Soviet block to bolster its economy, its ongoing resistance to being shaped by the business-lead interests of the US is noble too. Of course, it&#8217;s hard to get beneath the veneer of tourism and know what people really think. Yet to those unconvinced by the real-world benefits of capitalism, </span></span><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"></span></span><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">it&#8217;s also hard not to be impressed by at least a part of what socialist Cuba has achieved, and continues to struggle for. </span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;font-style:normal;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Ultimately though, whether or not you buy into Castro&#8217;s firm handed government and its results, Cuba is a country that will doubtlessly challenge the way you think. Each and every day, Nick and I spent hours contemplating Cuban socialism, and trying to decipher what we thought of it. Which, in my mind, is good a reason as any to visit this incredible place. </span></span></span></p>

This took advantage of the island&#039;s westerly winds. Most days we ended up in fantastic accommodation overlooking colonial squares, like this one in Remedios.</p></div>

Cyclists rub shoulders with locals riding old Chinese single speeds, or steering horse and carts...</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4717.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_47171.jpg" alt="DSC_4717.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">... or driving classic American cars imported before the revolution of &#039;59.</p></div>

To keep the country going, thousands of single speed bicycles were imported from China. </p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4613.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_4613.jpg" alt="DSC_4613.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Refreshingly, there&#039;s no insidious advertising from multinational-owned businesses. But what you will see are massive placards by the roadside quoting Che, Fidel, his brother Raul and other key figures in the Revolution.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4557.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_4557.jpg" alt="DSC_4557.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">As well as more subtle messages on many a street corner. Educate your child, reads this one. Cuba has one of the best literacy rates in the world, at 97%.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_5135.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_5135.jpg" alt="DSC_5135.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The fall of the Soviet Union in the early 90s and the ongoing trade embargo and has placed enormous strain on the country&#039;s socialist system. But the message is always the same. Hasta la Victoria Siempre: to victory, always. </p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4531.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_4531.jpg" alt="DSC_4531.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">We couldn&#039;t quite figure out what people thought of Fidel. But Che seems to be universal adored. Memories of the Argentine revolutionary Ernesto &#039;Che&#039; Guevara are everywhere. In Santa Clara, we visited his memorial. Killed in Bolivia in 1967, his ashes weren&#039;t returned to Cuba until thirty years later. I listened to a young mother telling her daughter Che&#039;s story as they walked around the adjoining museum. </p></div>

In Cuba there are no supermarkets to speak of, even in and around the larger cities. Small markets, or hole-in-the-walls like this one in Trinidad, are where you buy your fruit and vegetables.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4979.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_4979.jpg" alt="DSC_4979.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Which in turn come from places like these. There are hundreds of Organoponico farms scattered across the country, providing locally grown food for each municipality.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4986.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_4986.jpg" alt="DSC_4986.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I stopped to take a photo of one and was invited in to have a look around. Run by four workers, the place was filled with carrots, sweet potatoes, herbs and all kinds of green goodness, flourishing in the November sun.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" style="border:0 initial initial;" title="DSC_4982.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_49821.jpg" alt="DSC_4982.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">These little succulent little lettuces will soon be moved to a bigger field.</p></div>

It&#039;s a surprisingly rambunctious game, with each piece slapped down noisily to encouraging shouts and whistles.</p></div>
<div style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4388.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_4388.jpg" alt="DSC_4388.jpg" width="299" height="450" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">In a country where people somehow get by on so little, the tourist dollar is ever more important. Cuba spends a portion of the money earned to restore its buildings. Walking around immaculate central plazas like this one in Cienfuegos feels like stepping into a 50&#039;s film set.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4389.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_4389.jpg" alt="DSC_4389.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Some cars, like this Buick Eight, have been beautifully renovated...</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4233.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_4233.jpg" alt="DSC_4233.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">... but the majority, like this Chevrolet from &#039;59, are more sad looking affairs. The owner said it would cost him a couple of hundred dollars to get it back up and running, several times the average monthly salary.</p></div>
<div style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4730.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_4730.jpg" alt="DSC_4730.jpg" width="299" height="450" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">In any case, most people can&#039;t even afford to buy or own cars.Those that do rely on remittances sent in from abroad, or hand me downs from one generation to the next. Hence this near empty autopista, a three lane highway built with Soviet money.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4768.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_4768.jpg" alt="DSC_4768.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">At this time, Cuba entered what Castro called the &#039;Special Period in a TIme of Peace.&#039; Cost cutting Innovations included the stretch Lada... Other initiatives included enforced car sharing when hitchhiking. </p></div>
<div style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4502.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_4502.jpg" alt="DSC_4502.jpg" width="299" height="450" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">As a tourist though, we experienced a different world to the working Cuban. Casas Particulares may be amongst the cheapest official forms of accommodation for foreigners, but at 20 CUCs per night, they cost the equivalent of the average Cuban&#039;s monthly wage. Like their British counterparts, casas promise massive breakfasts. A spread like this will typically set you back 3 CUCs - a little over 3US.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_5466.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_5466.jpg" alt="DSC_5466.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">In fact, everyone seems to have something going on on the side - time and time again we were told how hard it was to survive on salaries or pensions alone compared to the &#039;glory days&#039; of the 80s. Like much of Latin America, remittances from families living abroad play a big part of the economy. Casas Particulares are one of the best businesses to be in, though there&#039;s a limit of two rooms per household, and high government taxes are levied. Here, Nick grapples with another Times Crossword in our beautiful casa in Matanzas.</p></div>
<div style="width: 307px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_3991.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_3991.jpg" alt="DSC_3991.jpg" width="297" height="450" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Almost all are incredibly well kept. This is where we had breakfast on our first morning in Havana. In a country where nothing is squandered or wasted, some felt more like museums than homes.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_5624" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_55261.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5624" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5624" title="DSC_5526" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_55261.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="299" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-5624" class="wp-caption-text">No doubt estate agents would go crazy for those original features. But in Cuba, there&#039;s no over inflated housing market - homes are swapped for ones of a similar size rather than bought and sold.</p></div>
<div style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4591.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_4591.jpg" alt="DSC_4591.jpg" width="299" height="450" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Out on the street, it&#039;s a different story. Most people can only afford to use the local currency, the Peso National. At twenty four pesos to a single CUC, your tourist money goes a long way. As you can see, even a sandwich won&#039;t set you back more than 5 pesos - a fifth of a CUC. That&#039;s not much more than 20c. </p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" style="border:0 initial initial;" title="DSC_5363.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_5363.jpg" alt="DSC_5363.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">In the countryside, amongst orchards of citrus fruit, this juice bar was a real find. A glass of fresh papaya juice here cost half a peso. About 2 cents.  </p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_5447.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_5447.jpg" alt="DSC_5447.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The peso pizza is a Cuban staple: hunk of white bread and fatty cheese that will set you back 20c. To the lucky ones travelling with foreign currency in their pockets, Cuba suddenly becomes embarrassingly cheap.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4801.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_4801.jpg" alt="DSC_4801.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The collision of these two worlds is evident all around. Trinidad&#039;s cobbled streets add even more character to this UNESCO heritage city...</p></div>

The main tourist draw is Cuba&#039;s stunning waters, home as they are to the largest coral reef in the world. While the big, government-run resorts have bagsied the main cays, there&#039;s still plenty of public spots to stop and cool off, like Punta Perdiz, on the way to Playa Larga.</p></div>

Rumour has it there have been 617 attempts on Fidel&#039;s life, including an exploding conch hidden on the ocean floor in an area he liked to dive in...</p></div>

Cuban medical knowhow is also exchanged for Venezuelan oil. The travel-restricted Cuban doctors are allowed two years working in Venezuela, before returning home for good.</p></div>

A history teacher we spoke to in Matanzas could see nothing positive about the revolution - citing the government&#039;s control over freedom of speech and Cuba&#039;s fall from economic glory as prime examples. As seen by this shell of a building close to the waterfront.</p></div>

<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_5661.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_5661.jpg" alt="DSC_5661.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">...revealing yet more beguiling turquoise waters. With a few more days in hand, this would have made (yet another) perfect stopover for the night.</p></div>

So we pushed on, fuelled by fresh sugar cane juice sold by the roadside.</p></div>

<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_5741.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_5741.jpg" alt="DSC_5741.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Perhaps a little worse for wear these days, a poster of Che still stands proud and tall. Considering its size, Cuba has been incredibly successful at the Olympic games, and even ranked 5th in the medals table in 1992. Baseball and boxing are particularly big sports here. </p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_5754.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/dsc_5754.jpg" alt="DSC_5754.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yet more Socialist propoganda greeted our arrival to the city, including billboards quoting the adverse effects of the trade embargo on the Cuban schooling and health system.</p></div>

This is the original boat that transported Fidel and his &#039;army&#039; of 82 fighters from Mexico to Cuba in 1956. It&#039;s protected behind glass and guard 24 hours a day.</p></div>

There can be few places as atmospheric as the Malecon. The sun was just setting as cycled towards the waterfront. Time just for one last sunset stroll...</p></div>

Nick and I agreed this has been one of our best tours together. Cuba is a place that&#039;s hard not to imagine returning to. I&#039;m already hatching plans for a cross country tour...</p></div>
