<h1>Snow n&#039; Mud Part 1: Del Norte to Antonito, CO.</h1>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing like a little meteological spice to add flavour to a bicycle ride.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#8217;s one reason I love to travel on two wheels. There&#8217;s no sidestepping oncoming elements as you might within the cocoon of a car. No easy way out of disconnecting from the realities of the seasons. Like it or lump it, it&#8217;s part of the experience.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Nancy has her first taste of snow biking/trudging (best enjoyed after the event) as we bid farewell to Colorado, and cross the border into the Land of Enchantment, New Mexico.</p>

Indiana Pass is perched at a lofty 11 920ft high - 3630m - and ranked by some as the toughest climb of the Great Divide. The first stretch was paved, a gentle climb through the valley, followed by steeper and corrugated sections. </p></div>

Gold was first discovered here back as 1870, but it was the process used to leach its remnants from the low grade ore, well over a century later, that contaminated the local creeks, adding to the area&#039;s already naturally high acidity . The clean up camping cost millions - possible more than the entire revenue earned by the mine.</p></div>

The advance party, Nick, Lael and Greg, had already texted us warnings of what lay ahead: some 4 miles of snow, leftovers from a previous storm. </p></div>

It unravelled in great loops down the valley, before crossing the Alamosa river. There was one last sting-in-the-tail climb up and over Stunner Pass to Platoro - a journey made by countless gold prospectors before us. The last light of the day highlighted the streaks of red oxide in the mountains, considered a giveway that gold was to be found nearby. </p></div>

We treated ourself to a night in a half-finished cabin built for Divide hikers and riders, in the appropriately named Gold Pan RV Park. It&#039;s neon sign enticed us in, while the rest of the settlement was almost completely borded up for winter. The campsite manager was a Texan escaping the summer heat. Beaming a gap-toothed smile, he told us he was from Lubbock, slap bang beside &#039;the largest military base in the free world.&#039; I&#039;m not sure if I was as reassured as he was...</p></div>
<div id="attachment_9978" style="width: 309px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/dsc_48261.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9978" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9978" title="DSC_4826" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/dsc_48261.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-9978" class="wp-caption-text">A few more words on Nancy are perhaps in order for storytelling purposes at this point. While she may vehemently deny it, having moved around the US over the years, Nancy is in fact a Texas Girl herself. The border town of El Paso, to be precise. Which, she insists, is about as un-Texas as you can get.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_9979" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/dsc_47772.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9979" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9979" title="DSC_4777" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/dsc_47772.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="299" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-9979" class="wp-caption-text">This being her first bike tour, Nancy had sought a few words of advice on the intricacies of two-wheeled travel and its accompanying paraphernalia, so I&#039;d issued her with a shopping list in a language she had yet to decipher. A little giddy with the idea of spending someone else&#039;s money, I argued the case for fitting a pair of Jeff Jones&#039; curvy Loop H-bars. Over twice the $$$ of a standard set of handlebars, I assured her they&#039;re a steal at half the price of a pair of this season&#039;s knee-high leather boots...</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4771.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/dsc_47711.jpg" alt="DSC_4771.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I couldn&#039;t quite convince her to to invest in a Rohloff speedhub for her Surly Troll - that kind of cash can only be generated upon selling your car... Mine, however, is still doing me proud, shifting with reassuring clunkiness come rain, shine or snow. </p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4909.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/dsc_4909.jpg" alt="DSC_4909.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Indeed, despite the temperatures, there&#039;s been no shortage of shine, bringing out the full splendour of Fall. But appearances can be deceiving, for after a mellow ride to Horca, we heard about a storm forecast that night. Our original plan had been to continue along the Great Divide and tackle the 10 000ft La Manga Pass. But as it was on the weathermen&#039;s hitist, it seemed prudent to detour off route. </p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4939.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/dsc_4939.jpg" alt="DSC_4939.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Instead, we pedalled to the lower elevations of Antonito, one of the stops along the old narrow gauge railroad, originally laid down in 1880. </p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_4933.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/dsc_4933.jpg" alt="DSC_4933.jpg" width="450" height="299" border="0" />Since 1970, the Cumbres and Toitec Scenic Railway has been taking tourists over the Cumbres Pass to Chamba, 64 miles away. </dt>

Which was just as well, as it was a ferociously windy night. The tent tossed and turned like a restless sleeper, flapping manically and smothering itself over our faces, as it buckled in the wind. But come morning, the sun was out, the wind had dropped, and the worst of the storm seemed to have passed us by, sponging away most clouds in its wake. We cheered! But little did we know...</p></div>
