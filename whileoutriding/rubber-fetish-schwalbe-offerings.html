<h1>Rubber fetish: Schwalbe offerings</h1>
<p>Cyclists tend to obsess about tyres; after all, they represent the two small patches of contact between us and the road, without which, we can&#8217;t get too far&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the latest round of <a href="http://www.schwalbe.de/gbl/en/startseite/index.php5?flash=1&amp;ID_Land=38&amp;ID_Sprache=2&amp;ID_Seite=126&amp;tn_mainPoint=&amp;tn_subPoint=" target="_blank">Schwalbe</a> tyres, and some first impressions.</p>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_3843.jpg" alt="DSC_3843.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dsc_3843.jpg" width="450" height="298" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Touring Trio: Extreme, Mondial and Dureme</p></div>
<p><strong>Adios XR, Hola Mondial </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve long been a fan of the venerable Marathon XR, the tyre of choice amongst long distance tourers for years. Nothing could beat it for big (I&#8217;m talking 10 000 km +) cross-continental journeys. It was the go-to tyre for anyone heading to Asia, South America or Africa, where reliability was paramount. Punctures were few and far between, and it just went on and on and on: the XR tread was near immortal.</p>
<div id="attachment_12198" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dsc_3869-2.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12198" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-12198" title="DSC_3869-2" alt="" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dsc_3869-2.jpg" width="450" height="298" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-12198" class="wp-caption-text">This old Marathon XR has been all over South West China and SE Asia, and it still looks all but brand new.</p></div>
<p>So, the decision to drop the XR from the vast, dependable Schwalbe tyre range was met with more than a little incredulity.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, there didn&#8217;t seem to be a direct replacement. There was the Extreme &#8211; which was grippy &#8211; and the Dureme &#8211; which was fast rolling. Both were considerably lighter, shaving close to a couple of hundred grams off per tyre. But as a result, neither were up to the kind of distances XR riders had become accustomed to, and demanded.</p>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_3850.jpg" alt="DSC_3850.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dsc_3850.jpg" width="450" height="298" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Extreme: bigger, softer lugs and a lighter carcass than the XR. But not so hard wearing.</p></div>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_3851.jpg" alt="DSC_3851.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dsc_3851.jpg" width="450" height="298" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Marathon Dureme: the Middle Way. Not as robust as the XR, but well suited to both paved and dirt roads.</p></div>
<p>Finally, the Mondial was launched &#8211; effectively the true successor to the XR. The heft is back &#8211; it&#8217;s 730g in a 26&#215;2.0 &#8211; but that&#8217;s okay, because it&#8217;s built for the long haul. Apart from the XR&#8217;s weight, the only real downside to its near indestructible tread was the firm ride and lack of bite off road. As such, the Mondial aims to improve on this, with Schwalbe&#8217;s new Travelstar compound. The tread pattern itself looks pretty similar; time will tell if it rolls as nicely and lasts as long.</p>
<div style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="DSC_3849.jpg" alt="DSC_3849.jpg" src="http://whileoutriding.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dsc_3849.jpg" width="450" height="298" border="0" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Marathon Mondial, vying to regain the XR&#8217;s popularity amongst the long distance cyclists of the world.</p></div>
<p><strong>Choices, choices&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>For the most part, Schwalbe&#8217;s range of touring tyres aren&#8217;t cheap. The Evolution folders go for a tear-inducing $90 each &#8211; though there&#8217;s the more affordable, wire-beaded Performance series for half that price.</p>
<p>In any case, we&#8217;re talking close to $100 for a pair of tyres at the very minimum, and up to $270 if you&#8217;re buying folders and need a spare. Still, with Schwalbe tyres holding a reputation for longevity &#8211; we&#8217;re talking up to 10 000kms plus, depending on conditions &#8211; the investment becomes worth it.</p>
<p>Inevitably, there&#8217;s a lot of common ground shared between all three tyres, so which works best for you will depends on what you intend to be doing the <em>majority</em> of the time.</p>
<p>Paved with a bit of dirt? Dureme.</p>
<p>Dirt with a bit of paved? Extreme.</p>
<p>Gargantuan distances and heavy loads? Mondial.</p>
<p>For most people, the Duremes will probably strike a perfect middle ground. The weight and tread won&#8217;t demoralise on pavement, and there&#8217;s enough volume for dirt road detours too.  For off-road riding with a fully rigid bike, it would be nice if it was available in a larger width than 2.0, especially as Schwalbe tyres tend to come up a little narrow. (just to add even more choice,  a variation on a theme is the  <a href="http://www.schwalbetires.com/bike_tires/road_tires/marathon_dureme_tandem" target="_blank">tandem</a> version, which claims to offer Mondial-like sidewall strength &#8211; overall weight is about the same &#8211;  with a slightly faster rolling tread).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the future of the Extreme &#8211; its once broad range seems to have been whittled down to just a 26&#215;2.0, available on the US site. It would be a shame if it was dropped completely. Opinions were divided about this tyre, but from my own experiences, it could handle a few thousand miles of rugged dirt road touring &#8211; especially at the front &#8211; without all the extra rotational weight of an XR.</p>
<p><strong>Some weights</strong></p>
<p>29&#215;2.0 Marathon Dureme, folding: 635g</p>
<p>26&#215;2.0 Marathon Mondial: 730g</p>
<p>26&#215;2.0 Marathon Extreme: 590g</p>
<p><strong>My take</strong></p>
<p>If I was embarking on a long, overseas tour, without the ambition to mountain bike along the way, I&#8217;d run a set of Mondials. If I was aspiring to ride dirt roads where I possibly could, I&#8217;d let a Mondial take the brunt of the load at the back, and team it with an Extreme at the front. This would save rotational weight and offer some extra grip.</p>
<p>As for a spare, I&#8217;d either stash a Dureme &#8211; which could then be swapped out with the front for long road stints (preserverving the life of the Extreme). Or, if I envisaged mountain biking regularly along the way, maybe a second Extreme &#8211; or some kind of MTB tread &#8211; which I could swap out with the rear Mondial for lighter, livelier mountain bike rides.</p>

Looks to be the best dirt road distance touring option at the moment, with a fast rolling central tread. First impressions are that these tyres roll nicely on road, and can handle some trail too &#8211; as long as it&#8217;s not too sandy or muddy. There&#8217;s a plushness in the ride, which I prefer over the rock-hard old XRs.</p></div>
<p><strong>Big Wheels</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the range of large volume, touring-worthy 29er tyres (ie fat 700c) is seriously slim compared to what&#8217;s on offer for 26in wheels. That&#8217;s one reason to stick to the smaller, more readily available tyre size.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Dureme is also available in a 29&#215;2.0. This makes it almost ideal for dirt road, non technical touring. A 2.1 or 2.2 would be even better, as would the option of an Extreme in that size. But it&#8217;s a good start.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Nothing beats putting in miles on a tyre to really know how it handles, and how it lasts. So if anyone has some input on how the Mondial &#8211; and other tyres &#8211; fare, it would be great to hear.</p>
