<h1>Jackson WY, to Flaming Gorge, UT</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve now deviated off the Great Divide Route in search of a night&#8217;s camping that&#8217;s not on/under snow, on the way to Fruita, Colorado.</p>

<p>Leaving Jackson was hard. It&#8217;s often that way when you slip in with a group of kind people, pamper yourself with some home comforts (a cooking hob and a shower) and begin to put down some roots (read: mess). So when I did finally return to the road on a somewhat bleak and overcast day, I put The Band on the ipod and tried some harmony singing to lift my pensive mood.</p>
<div id="attachment_1554" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1554" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1554" title="DSC_7710" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7710.jpg" alt="I sought advice here.

When I went in, a man was trying to swap a gun with him for a horse. Alpine was cowboy central and thick, silver caterpillar moustaches were the fashion. </p></div>
<p>Initially, a cyclepath cosseted me out of town, linking up with the suitably serpentine Snake River, working its way down along a broad valley. Once in Alpine, I stopped to glean conditions along the Grey&#8217;s River Road, the dirt track that would lead me via the Wyoming Mountains into the desert. By all accounts, it would be a hard ride, so I treated myself to an overpriced, $4 brownie infused with swirls of cheese, which I pecked at and savoured for 3 days.</p>

Then: &#039;Of course, what you really have to watch out for is Man,&#039; said the guy buying a 6 pack, as his pickup idled in the scratch of land outside. &#039;Yes,&#039; she agreed, warming to the topic, &#039;Man can do some very bad things&#039;. There was a pause as we all dwelled on our own dark thoughts. And on that note, I set off alone on the highway, thinking about how, for a country that takes so much pride in its freedom, I&#039;d never received so many warnings to Stay Safe. Although they&#039;re all uttered with the best intentions, the negative vibe they leave in their wake inevitably niggles at my confidence, which is a shame. Anything can happen to you, anywhere in the world. Which doesn&#039;t mean you should just stay indoors. </p></div>

As I often do, I was questioning this itinerant lifestyle when I caught myself riding pace with a herd of antelope in the sagebrush. A moment later, a gleaming chrome truck whistled past, blotting out my elongated, late afternoon shadow for an instant. Two brief moments that brought me back to the present. And it all made sense again.</p></div>

My saddle had broken, with the rails shearing clean off. I was gutted, as this was the comfiest perch I&#039;ve owned.

I should be able to get a new one under warranty. </p></div>

Jim hobbled into action, and within a few minutes, we were driving down the road to see Ira, the local welder. Half an hour later, the saddle was back on the bike. Ira wasn&#039;t convinced the weld would hold; hopefully it would get me the 65 miles up and over a 8450ft pass to Vernal, where a bike shop was to be found. Jim and Barbara invited me to stay the night, and we dined on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  A Mormon family, they included my saddle and its repair in their prayers before eating, which I thought was rather touching. </p></div>
