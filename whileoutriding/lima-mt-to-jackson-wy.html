<h1>Lima, MT to Jackson, WY</h1>
<p>With all this snow billowing in across the region, I&#8217;m now having to patch together a modified plan, borrowing bits that are still rideable from the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route, with (boring) stretches of roads that are more likely to be open. As an overview, the route heads from Montana briefly into Idaho, before crossing into Wyoming, and then Colorado. Which means more and more mountains, and higher and higher elevations. At this point, the question is: should I head south towards the warmer climes of Utah and hit the mountain bike meccas of Fruita and Moab. Or should I persevere into Colorado and risk more snow&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some pictures I took while crossing Idaho to Jackson, Wyoming, where I&#8217;m based at the moment.</p>
<div id="attachment_1376" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1376" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1376" title="DSC_7057" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7057.jpg" alt="Outside Lima's motel, was this wonderful looking car for sale.

I did have a moment when I thought: is this really me, age 35, sleeping on the floor of a laundromat, alone, counting my every last dollar? But then I decided I&#039;m okay with that. I like living this way for now. It feels invigorating; being outside of my comfort zone reawakens my senses and makes me feel truly alive. </p></div>
<div id="attachment_1379" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1379" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1379" title="DSC_7080" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7080.jpg" alt="Cooking up a feast of a dinner.

<div id="attachment_1396" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1396" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1396" title="DSC_7103" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7103.jpg" alt="Though three, table thick blueberry pancakes in the local diner did set me up nicely for the morning. " width="400" height="266" /><p id="caption-attachment-1396" class="wp-caption-text">Three plank-thick blueberry pancakes in the local diner set me up nicely in the morning. Most of the conversations I&#039;ve been overhearing have been about hunting, often for wolfs, which has just been introduced this year. Like: &#039;I saw a pretty white one in the hills behind– should make someone a real special prize.&#039;</p></div>
<p>Diners, like the outside of cheap supermarkets as I&#8217;ve come to discover, are good places for weird conversations with unusual people. One of the waitresses in Lima looked a little like a white version of Tina Turner &#8211; very cool. Tucking into my pancakes, I was soon approached by a man with claw hand, who&#8217;d lost his fingers in an industrial accident. Retired since he was 32, he proceded explain the ins and outs of different mining equipment, and what each truck could haul, pincering his remaining fingers as he spoke. My eyes glazed over – I fear it&#8217;s the same reaction when I talk about bikes to people&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_1380" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1380" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1380" title="DSC_7112" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7112.jpg" alt="When I got on the road the next morning, it was 10F, that's -12C! I wore all my layers, even my jeans, on the long climb. " width="400" height="266" /><p id="caption-attachment-1380" class="wp-caption-text">When I took to the road at 9am, it was 10F . That&#039;s -12C! </p></div>
<p>I was togged up in all my layers, even my trusty jeans, for the long climb up and over the pass, and didn&#8217;t even break into a sweat. My water bottles froze as I rode, as did my beard. Beards sure keep you warm, but can be socially embarrasing when you start to defrost mid conversation.</p>
<div id="attachment_1381" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1381" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1381" title="DSC_7124" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7124.jpg" alt="I've had to detour off route, as the forest track to Lake View is currne" width="400" height="266" /><p id="caption-attachment-1381" class="wp-caption-text">Unfortunately  I&#039;ve had to detour off the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route for now, as the forest track to Lake View is currently impassable. Luckily the Interstate was almost empty, with a massive shoulder to ride on, a safe cushion from the goliath trucks that thundered past. Sometimes they tooted their horns, low and resonant, in greeting.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1383" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1383" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1383" title="DSC_7149" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7149.jpg" alt="Hello Idaho.

<div id="attachment_1385" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1385" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1385" title="DSC_7150" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7150.jpg" alt="Lots of dilapidated, abandoned houses by the roadside. " width="400" height="266" /><p id="caption-attachment-1385" class="wp-caption-text">First impressions? Not a lot of people, but lots of dilapidated, abandoned houses by the roadside.</p></div>
<p>Luckily I didn&#8217;t have to ride the interstate too long, as I tracked down a snow-free gravel road that cut round the mountains out of Spencer, a one strip hamlet famous for its locally mined opals.</p>
<p>I popped into the local gas station/opal store to check directions, and was somewhat embarrassed to find my beard defrosting as I spoke, dripping onto a prestine counter. &#8216;It&#8217;s okay,&#8217; said the lady, &#8216;happens all the time when my husband has a beard,&#8217; before hurrying off to fetch me a paper towel.</p>
<p>Later, as I was standing outside, cold and uncertain as to where I was heading, I managed to resist two temptations. First I met BK, who offered me a lift in his 4WD to Jackson, where I was headed. Then Connie pulled up, travelling south from Alberta to San Francisco in her VW van, with a Husky that adopted her, as she put it. As we sat and chatted, a biting coldness overwhelmed me. It was the kind of coldness that burrows deep, even deeper than all my layers. When she offered to give me a ride south to warmer climes, there was no doubt in my mind that I&#8217;d turn it down. But part of me wished I could have taken her up on it, and that I didn&#8217;t need to feel so constrained by my plans.</p>
<p>Instead, I set off once more, my body and my mood warming up on the first hill, music playing in my ears, uplifting my spirits. A little while later, the sheriff passed by and pulled over to see what I was up to, a lone cyclist making his way slowly across an empty backroad, under a porcelain sky.</p>
<p>Indeed, the lanscape was all but bereft of features. Lumps of obsidian, once used by native Indians for arrowheads, protruded out of the earth. Voles scuttled by, their tales pointing straight up into the air like radio antennas.</p>
<div id="attachment_1386" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1386" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1386" title="DSC_7158" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7158.jpg" alt="I stopped to have a chat to Blaine Grover, 85. " width="400" height="263" /><p id="caption-attachment-1386" class="wp-caption-text">Blaine Grover, 85. Although he now lives in Dubois, just down the road, he moved into the house behind in 1942. It didn&#039;t look like much had changed since then. </p></div>
<p>Roadside encounters uplifted my mood too. I love how approachable cycling makes me to people I pass by. Like Blaine Grover, a local farmer, who shook his head in wonder at the notion of riding down from Alaska. &#8216;How old are you?&#8217; he asked. When I told him I was 35, he laughed merrily and said: &#8216;Aren&#8217;t you old enough to know better?!&#8217; Then he asked me how old I thought he was, tottering slightly as he stepped back for me to make a proper appraisal. I was suitably complimentary.</p>
<div id="attachment_1387" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1387" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1387" title="DSC_7165" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7165.jpg" alt="I like the way this house was almost identical to the doghouse.

Or maybe it&#039;s the other way round...</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1388" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1388" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1388" title="DSC_7177" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7177.jpg" alt="Rexburg, just down the road, is considered one of America's 'reddest' towns!" width="400" height="266" /><p id="caption-attachment-1388" class="wp-caption-text">Rexburg, just down the road, is considered one of America&#039;s &#039;reddest&#039; towns.</p></div>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Soon, farming land was replaced by an expanse of sage scrub and tall, spindly wooden ranch gateways, cordorning off what seemed like vast tracts of empty land. Abandoned houses, their peeling paint muted over time, dotted the landscape.</p>
<div id="attachment_1495" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1495" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1495" title="DSC_7293" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_72931.jpg" alt="Another dilapidated Idahoan farmhouse.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">I&#8217;d heard there were ice caves along the way but didn&#8217;t want to end up sharing one with a local mountain lion, so opted for a clearing amongst the sage brush; a peaceful spot is was too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">That night, the temperature plummetted. Nowadays when I go to sleep, I&#8217;m pretty much in everything I wear during the day – long johns, jeans, base layer, jersey, fleece, jacket and wooley hat. At least it makes getting going the next day pretty quick&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_1395" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1395" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1395" title="DSC_7230" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7230.jpg" alt="I while away the cold night watching episodes of Flight of the Conchords.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">In St Anthony, a backwater farming town festooned with 50s, neon-signed shops, I asked a lady for directions at a four way junction; she immediately invited me in to stay at her farm down the road. But it was early, and I needed to push on to keep ahead of the storm. To check up on the weather, I stopped in at the visitor centre, which shared its offices with the police station, the medical centre, the town treasury and the library. It smelled of a hospital and there, a lady breathing through an oxygen tank marvelled at my accent, and suggested I check in at the forestry office, 12 miles down the road in Ashton.</p>

<p>In Ashton, I was told that snow was 40 per cent likely for that night, which might mean several miles of pushing over the pass. But I was keen to get back on the route, and to experience the remoteness of those forest tracks again, so figured that with the odds in my favour, I&#8217;d give it a go.</p>
<div id="attachment_1491" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1491" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1491" title="DSC_7300" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_73001.jpg" alt="XXX" width="400" height="266" /><p id="caption-attachment-1491" class="wp-caption-text">Into Wyoming and the Targhee National Forest.

That night, I listened to flakes crinkling on the tent, like candy wrappers in a cinema. </p></div>
<p>I was hoping all the bears would have slunk off to hibernate by now, but apparently there are still plenty around. In fact, they hang around until the end of hunting season, feasting on the entrails that hunters leave behind from the kills they&#8217;ve gutted and chopped up. I also heard that this forest is where the &#8216;bad grizzlies&#8217; are transferred to, if they misbehave in nearby Yellowstone National Park.</p>
<div id="attachment_1477" style="width: 276px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1477" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1477" title="DSC_7319" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7319.jpg" alt="It didn't feel so cold that night, but it froze the water in my cooking pot.

<p>In the morning, the sun was beaming in all its glory, and the night&#8217;s snowfall had compacted down, filling in the body-jarring corrugated track that had rattled loose my fillings the day before.</p>
<div id="attachment_1478" style="width: 276px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1478" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1478" title="DSC_7352" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7352.jpg" alt="This marker had increments for 11 feet of snow..." width="266" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-1478" class="wp-caption-text">This marker had increments for 11 feet of snow...</p></div>
<p>As I rode, two National Park Rangers, Chris and Jason, pulled over in their truck for a chat, surprised to see a cyclist out alone in the forest.  Chris insisted I grab myself a coffee and a beer in the resort down the road, and put it on his tab. Then, a jeep with two distinctly glamorous couples from Idaho pulled over to find out what I was up to. The driver was clearly a cyclist, noting my Brooks saddle and Rohloff hub, so I enthused about this wonderful route, and how fortunate he was in having it in his backyard.</p>
<div id="attachment_1479" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1479" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1479" title="DSC_7405" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7405.jpg" alt="Gutted. " width="400" height="261" /><p id="caption-attachment-1479" class="wp-caption-text">Uh oh. Roadworks. Unlike India, where cyclists can weave there way between road crews and steamrollers with little concern for &#039;health and safety&#039;, in the US, the rules are the rules, and you have to be driven through. Gutted. Great views of the Teton Range though. </p></div>
<p>For the first time on this trip, I had to take a ride in a pilot truck through 8 miles of roadworks, despite pleading over the radio with the head honcho. I&#8217;ve no doubt he gets the same pleas from every other cyclist on their &#8216;special&#8217; journey. The only way round it was to stay until work ended at 7.30pm, when it&#8217;s dark. It was a deflating moment, but I tried to see it in a positive light too. Riding every single last mile really just panders to your ego. Having to swallow your pride once in a while is no bad thing.</p>
<div id="attachment_1480" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1480" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1480" title="DSC_7439" src="http://www.whileoutriding.com/pics/2009/10/dsc_7439.jpg" alt="XXX" width="400" height="259" /><p id="caption-attachment-1480" class="wp-caption-text">The skies cleared, and as I rode round Jackson Lake, the Teton range sharpened into view. The highest peak in the range is Grand Teton, at 13 770ft. The peak in the centre of this shot is Mount Moran, at 12 605ft. Inevitably given its beauty, the roads are noticeably more busy now, even this late in the season. </p></div>
<p>I&#8217;d planned to try and reach Jackson, but there was a strong headwind to contend with. When I stopped in at the grocers along the way, I bumped into Sean, Ingrid and Kate, the family from Skye travelling to South America on their tandem. The campsite there was just $5 for hikers and bikers, so that helped seal the deal for an impromptu stop. I was pleased to note that RVs pay $45, the way it should be, to rebalance the coffers. It&#8217;s a shame that in in a lot of official campsites in the US and Canada, a cyclist looking for a small patch of land to pitch a tent pays the same as a family-filled RV on their massive pad of gravel.</p>

Nowadays it&#039;s the weekend escape of the billionaire crowd, and I noticed private jets to-ing and fro-ing from the airport. Still, as I rode into town, I could really picture riders galloping across the plains in a scene from the old Wild West.</p></div>
<p>At first glance, Jackson seems a curious blend of ultra wealthy residents rubbing shoulders with hippyish ski bums &#8211; apparently it has some of the best, and easily accessed backcountry skiing and snowboarding in the country. Everyone glows with the healthy sheen of the outdoors. It&#8217;s the kind of place where you can leave the keys in your car, and your house unlocked. In fact, as I rode into town, Nick, who&#8217;d cycled to Jackson from New Hamphire to work and ski, offered me a place to stay, having seen me way on his way back from work.</p>
<p>Right now, I&#8217;m staying with <a href="http://www.thesnaz.com/" target="_blank">David Gonzales</a>, a film maker/photographer/climber/skier, who kindly offered to put me up at the last moment. David keeps a great photo story blog and makes some very cool films, often revolving around the area and its issues. Today, I drove a neighbour&#8217;s truck so he could get a tyre fixed &#8211; the first time I&#8217;ve driven in a long while. The engine was low pitched and burbly. Despite myself, I did feel strangely powerful&#8230; Soon I was feeling confident enough to have my elbow sticking out of the window, and with my scraggly beard, I felt like a proper Mountain Man.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to spend a winter in a mountain town one day, though of course I&#8217;d invest in a Surly <a href="http://www.surlybikes.com/frames/pugsley_frame/" target="_blank">Pugsley</a>&#8230;</p>

Which means I get to housesit David&#039;s lovely dog Peppy, as he&#039;s headed out of town for the night. Today, I mooched around town and checked out Teton Mountaineering. Pepy was amazing - following me around without a leash, drawing a crowd of admirers at every store. I want a Pepy! </p></div>
