<h1>Cycling Europe 2019: Day 1, Yorkshire To Reading</h1>

<p>We’re off. Not a great deal of cycling taking place today; just a 10km journey from home to the train station in Huddersfield and the prospect of an even shorter cycle to a friend’s house once I arrive in Reading. It is not the stuff of epic adventures but does get me nearer to my destinations of the Isle of Wight tomorrow, Sunday, and then Spain &amp; Portugal on Wednesday and thereafter. However, for the record, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here are the details of that first cycle (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cyclemeter.com/b5118193f3bb3708/Cycle-20190824-0743-25958" target="_blank">here are the details of that first cycle</a> at least. Much of the rest of the day is being spent on trains but I don’t mind that&#8230;</p>



<p><div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="youtube-player" width="890" height="501" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z73_JHQCI-E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-GB&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div></p>



<p>&#8230;indeed I’ve already had two interesting conversations about my plans for the next few weeks. Firstly on the platform of Huddersfield station with a member of Holmfirth Cycling Club. He promised to come and hear me speak about what I’ve been up to when I do just that next year at one of the Calderdale CTC winter club nights that Has only just been arranged this week. I wonder what tales I will have to recount? I’ll know in three weeks. Keep following these posts and you’ll know too. If nothing much happens, I’ll spice it up a bit. Just like I did in the books. (Of course I didn’t!) Secondly, I struck up conversation with a Polish cyclist who was taking his Spa Cycles titanium-framed bike to none other than the Trans-Pennine Trail. That’s where I was only last Sunday (see post below). Those who think you are ever lonely on a solo cycle tour have clearly never embarked upon one themselves&#8230;</p>



<p>The only thing that is currently causing me any anxiety is the well-being of Wanda, the bike (do keep up!). She is currently, I hope, suspended in a small cage in coach D of this Cross Country Trains train from Manchester to (for me) Reading. I say ‘hope’ as she is surrounded by most of the people from a cancelled train service who are crammed into the aisles and open spaces of this train. For all I know she could have been removed by some hoodlum in Wolverhampton and being fenced in a local pub as I type, oblivious of her fate&#8230; Life, it seems, is rarely stress-free.</p>



<p>So that’s day 1 of this modest cycle tour. 20 days to go. Stay tuned!</p>
