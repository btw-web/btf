<h1>Mosquitoes, Manholes &amp; Miracles</h1>
<p>When I look at the map, Pisa sits in a lowland area with lots of blue lines indicating both natural and man-made waterways. The tower is / was sinking into the swamp / bog upon which Pisa is built. I can only hope that this means that as soon as I escape the big puddle tomorrow, I will also escape the damned mosquitoes as they are making life very, very uncomfortable. If I were to count, I must have a number of bites that rivals some of my most impressive days in the saddle in terms of kilometres. A plea: if anyone has an effective way to fight the little bastards then please, please let me know. Basil did suggest Avon body milk but as far as I am aware, the Avon Lady doesn&#8217;t do house, or even tent calls in Italy. Just while I&#8217;m having a rant about them, what is their purpose? The mosquito seems to be universally despised, it spreads malaria for goodness sake so just what the **** is its reason for existence and if it does have a solid argument that would hold up in front of the toughest Old Bailey judges while be cross examined by Michael Mansfield, why hasn&#8217;t evolution kicked in and made we humans immune to their &#8216;charms&#8217;?<br />
Slight pause there because, after consultation with my German neighbours, I have just invested in four citron candles&#8230;. So far no impact. I have two of the four candles balanced on my knees as I sit cross-legged on the ground like a yoga student (good practice I suppose for Otto Sentieri &#8211; see &#8220;Destination&#8221; above). If I ever find out that any of the money from the BBC Wildlife Fund (currently standing at 87% of target by the way, plus money from Gift Aid) is invested in any way, shape or form to sustain the World&#8217;s population of mosquitoes, I shall not be happy. I was going to put a reckless promise there instead of the bland &#8216;shall not be happy&#8217; but I hate having my words quoted back to me.<br />
Siena, doesn&#8217;t look as if it has the same geography as Pisa. I bloody-well hope not for it is my destination for tomorrow. I may, however, have greater things to worry about. According to the Rough Guide, one of the two annual &#8216;Siena Palios&#8217; starts on the 13th August. Tomorrow is the 12th and does that mean that the campsite may be crowded out by people eager to see some of the four-day spectacle that involves horses been ridden around Campo at full pelt? You may remember the scene from the last James Bond film where Daniel Craig appears from a manhole cover (I think) only narrowly missing the approaching horses. Something like that. Mind you, if you are a horsey type, would you be camping. The campers and the horse crowd seem two very different social groups. That said, if you are a horse lover them you may well choose to stay well away; the race itself doesn&#8217;t seem in with any chance of getting a seal if approval from the RSPCA anytime soon&#8230;<br />
Tonight&#8217;s entertainment has just been announced (see last night&#8217;s post); it is a magician and, according to the English version of the announcement he &#8220;&#8230;will be performing on the swimming pool&#8221;. That&#8217;s not magic, that&#8217;s a miracle!</p>
