<h1>The Wisdom Of Leeds</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A few days I posted a video about the wisdom of the Dutch in planning &amp; building their cycle network. Now it&#8217;s the turn of my fellow Yorkshire folk to bask in the glory I am about to heap upon them. As I type I am sitting on a train from Leeds to London having spent a couple of days with my family. I arrived quite early at the station in central Leeds so I went for a wander outside. I wasn&#8217;t expecting to find that the hanging gardens of Babylon had been planted in front of the station so it was no disappointment to find that they hadn&#8217;t. What I did find however, brought me an equal amount of surprise and joy. So much so that I took a picture. Here it is;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/20111026-143915.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/20111026-143915.jpg?w=890" alt="20111026-143915.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Initially I thought it was a conveniently-located bike shop so I wandered in to browse. There was something not quite right about the place however. It was certainly an Evans bike shop but they appeared to have started selling second-hand bikes. How strange. I wandered around the circular-shaped building and slowly realised that these bikes weren&#8217;t for sale, they were being stored there. This was a garage for bikes with a small Evans shop at its centre and a chap working in an equally petite workshop just to one side. How brilliant. I got chatting to the mechanic. Leeds Cycle Point was, it transpires, set up by one of the railway companies &#8211; Abellio, who are (no surprises here), a Dutch train operator! &#8211; and operated by Evans. It offers secure parking for up to 300 bikes, repair, rental, retail and information about cycling in Leeds. To store your bike there for a day costs £1 but you can buy monthly or annual subscriptions (£15 and £120 respectively). Those with subscriptions are given a swipe card allowing them to access the building from 6am to midnight. The Cycle Point is staffed from 7am until 7pm for casual users. The start-up cost was £700,000. How utterly wonderful.<br />
Now, a question especially for those of you who are reading this in my corner of England; Berkshire. Can you think of any local towns whose railway station is currently going through a £500 million rebuilding project where the country&#8217;s second Cycle Point would be perfectly located? Have a think about it while you look at some more pictures from Leeds;</p>
