<p style="text-align:justify;"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Japan was pencilled in for 2020 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/japan2020/" target="_blank">Japan was pencilled in for 2020</a>. Will that happen? Who knows? 2020 is scarily close to &#8216;now&#8217; and I am sceptical that I will ever manage to jump the not-insignificant financial hurdles that would be required for me to fly to Tokyo in an Olympic year and then cycle the length of the country. (If anyone with a spare wad of cash would like to sponsor me, I&#8217;m open to offers.) </p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">But let&#8217;s not get ahead of ourselves. That is 2020 and we are still in 2019. I had very credible plans to return to Andermatt and cycle down large sections of the Rhine &#8211; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="full details here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2019/03/03/return-to-the-rhine-in-2019/" target="_blank">full details here</a> &#8211; which would have combined with a speaking engagement I have booked on a river cruise from Basel to Düsseldorf in early June, but the delivery date of the new bike at the end of June has put paid to that plan. Back to the drawing board&#8230; Or rather, the EuroVelo map:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It&#8217;s almost 10 years since I set off from my flat in southern England with Brindisi in southern Italy as my destination. Since then I&#8217;ve not only cycled the length of the EuroVelo 5 but also the EuroVelo 8 and much of the EuroVelos 1 and 3. Lots of EuroVelos remain and it would be good if, over the next 10 years, I were able to cycle the rest of the network. To get me started with the new bike, perhaps one of the new, shorter routes; EuroVelo 17, the Rhone Cycle Route, or EuroVelo 19, the Meuse Cycle Route?</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Or how about breaking free from the constraints of the EuroVelo network and going rogue, &#8216;off grid&#8217; if you like? Catching a ferry to Rotterdam and then, upon arrival, tossing a coin to see if I turn right and head along the coast in the direction of France or turn left and head along the coast towards Jutland. That northern coast of France is an enticing one&#8230;</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">As I sit here at 10:45pm on a Tuesday evening in April I&#8217;ll be honest; I haven&#8217;t got a clue&#8230; Suggestions more than welcome!</p>
