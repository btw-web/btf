<h1>Election 2019: A Fork In The Road</h1>

<p class="has-text-color has-background has-drop-cap has-very-light-gray-color has-vivid-red-background-color">The beauty of a democracy &#8211; even a half-baked one like the one operating in the UK &#8211; is that you can vote  for whoever you want; Conservative, Labour, SNP, Plaid, Lib Dem, Green, Brexit, UKIP, DUP… The key thing is that you think about the consequences of doing so. But here&#8217;s my opinion&#8230;</p>



<p>I would love to have a rainbow coalition of parties in government; Corbyn in charge (although I think there are others &#8211; Keir Stamer, Caroline Lucas etc… &#8211; who would make better candidates in the longer term) working alongside the Lib Dems, SNP, Green(s) to form a left leaning government that works in the best interests of the majority of people in Britain. People across this country have been duped by the right wing for many, many years. In 1979, Mrs Thatcher stood on the steps of Downing Street and uttered the following (quoted) words:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;Where there is discord, may we bring harmony. Where there is error, may we bring truth. Where there is doubt, may we bring faith. And where there is despair, may we bring hope.&#8221;</em></p><cite>Margaret Thatcher, quoting Francis of Assisi</cite></blockquote>



<p>After 27 years of the Tories being in control of Britain, it hasn&#8217;t happened. In fact, her comments bring a ludicrous smile to my face (<em>&#8220;may we bring truth&#8230;&#8221;</em>!). Yet millions of people still vote for them. Just as millions voted for Brexit. Those people have been duped into believing that their lives are fantastic. <em>We live in the fifth richest country in the world! Look at the city of London and all those stunning skyscrapers! Visit the shops full of shiny things to buy!</em> Yet take a cycle ride across Europe and you will struggle to find the levels of deprivation that you find in almost all British towns and cities. This country contains some of the wealthiest regions of the European Union. But it also hosts a disproportionate number of the poorest. The gap between rich and poor in the UK is stunning. And the people who finance the Conservative Party (as well as the billionaire owners of the Mail, Telegraph, Sun, Times&#8230;) want to keep it that way. Our country is crumbling through lack of investment; the hospitals, the schools, social services, the transport network, the roads&#8230; don&#8217;t get me started on the cycle lanes! </p>



<p>A left-leaning coalition would begin to put that right. It will only happen by voting out the Tories. A vote for the future of Britain might well be a tactical one. It is for me. The rich funders of the Tory Party won&#8217;t thank you for doing it but hey, that&#8217;s democracy, even democracy British-style&#8230;</p>



<p>Watch this video made by Ken Loach if you are struggling to understand the slogan &#8216;<em>for the many, not the few</em>&#8216;. You are probably &#8211; like me &#8211; in the former group&#8230; </p>
