<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;"><em>By Oliver Devon</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing beats the fresh air, breathtaking view, and the thrill of riding your bike on a new barely touched trail. The adrenaline of rushing down that unknown path makes the hair on the back of your neck stand.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Getting ready for this journey is an adventure of its own. Even the dirt of your cycling shoes from your last trail has a certain magic to it. Your backpack and EDC are now packed with your favourite tools and before you go make sure you do a last security check on your bike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most important of all, remember you’re going to Europe. Once you pick your car, make sure it has a sturdy hitch mount, that the <a href="https://bikegearexpert.com/best-bike-racks-for-hatchback-cars-with-spoilers/">car bike rack is ready for the road</a>. Some of these babies are quite difficult to adjust so ask the car dealership before you hop on or just pick one with a model you have back home. The rugged European roads are filled with surprises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without much further ado, let’s go the five of the best mountain bike trails in Eastern Europe</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Reitanov-Lipsk-Dobromyslov-Domanovo (Belarus)</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the most beautiful mountain bike trails in Belarus. It has aproximately 65 miles and it takes you from the small Reitanov to the stunning Domanovo. You will have the opportunity to ride your bike on this trail and pass through Lipsk and Dobromyslov in your way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who have visited the road mentioned that it is perfect for beginners. However, keep in mind that you will probably need about 6 to 9 hours to complete this road. If you are a beginner it is best to start bright and early in the morning so you have time to catch a break and take photos of the amazing forest you cross on your way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>2. The Lion Route- Golubac 5 Route-IPA (Serbia)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are looking to another reason to visit the beautiful country Serbia, then you found it. This is one of the 5 MBT in the area of Banat. All of these roads were made between 2015-2016 and they are amazing. The Lion Route is probably the best one from all 5. It offers you the possibility to travel the mountains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, this is a great opportunity for those who also want to ride some mountain bike trails in Romania since this route is very close to the border. The forests, mountain rocks, animals, and places you are going to see during this route are amazing. This road has a moderate difficulty and it can be done in approximately 5 hours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>3. Singltrek pod Smrkem &#8211; Obri Sud Loop din Nove Mesto pod Smrkem (Czech Republic)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, we know that the name is a bit tricky, however, the kind people who visited this MBT trail posted their adventure on <a href="https://www.komoot.com/smarttour/172106">Singltrek pod Smrkem &#8211; Obri Sud Loop din Nove Mesto pod Smrkem</a> with all the necessary details. The start of this journey is located at a beautiful camping site named Singltrek Centrum. There you will be able to get ready for the new adventure. This camping site has a breathtaking view that will stay with you for a long time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fortunately, you will return to the same campsite after crossing paths with the stunning Obri Sud where you can stop for a while to catch your breath and enjoy the amazing view in the forest. After that your trails continues to the winkel trail and it finishes with the Nad Kyselkou trail that take you right back where you started.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">4. Miskhorka- Yalta (Russia)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mother Russia comes to surprise us with an easy yet fascinating MBT trail. The <a href="https://www.singletracks.com/bike-trails/miskhorka.html">Miskhorka trail</a> is located in Yalta and it 5 km. However, you need to take into consideration the fact that the elevation is about 1,150 m. You can complete this trail in less than 1 hour if you’ve got the skills. This makes the road a simple one that can be done by beginners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you want to see how good are your skills, you can even participate to a downhill race that is organised every year on this trail. However, plan ahead a of time because many people love to come to this DH race. Also, check the exact date of the race because it is in a different period each year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>5. Transalpina (Romania)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You probably heard about the amazing road Transfagarasan. Well, it is not the only great road in Romania. <a href="https://www.wikiloc.com/mountain-biking-trails/transalpina2133m-21-22-08-2009-503339">Transalpina</a> is another breath of fresh air for those who love mountain bike trails. Although it is a road for cars, a special trail is designed so that bikers can also enjoy this experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recommended that you make this trail in two days. You can start from Ranca and end up at the Campsite Obarsia Lotrului. There you can spend the night and continue the route up to Polovragi early in the morning. We guarantee you some of the most amazing views and a rush of adrenaline all the way.</p>
