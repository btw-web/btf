<h1>The Sound Of Cycle Touring</h1>

<p class="has-text-color has-background has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify has-very-light-gray-color has-vivid-red-background-color">Some names are easily forgettable. David Evans, Margaret Butcher, Terry Wilson&#8230; (I just made those up. Apologies if you are offended because you have one of those names.) My own name isn&#8217;t that exciting; Andrew Sykes. That&#8217;s why I stuck the &#8216;P&#8217; in there for the purpose of the identifying me as a writer; Andrew P. Sykes has a little more gravitas, no? I digress&#8230; Some names, however, are a little more memorable. Flash Gordon. Scarlett O&#8217;Hara. Sherlock Holmes. Then again, perhaps those names were just as boring as the rest before their creators got hold of them. We will never know. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In the past ten years of being &#8216;Cycling Europe&#8217;, I have been contacted by many, many hundreds of people. Most have fairly standard names. Once in a while, however, a name will stand out. Lester Knibb. Billy Romp. Otto Sentieri. (Although that third one is not actually someone&#8217;s name; it was just mistaken for someone&#8217;s name and it has stuck.) </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Paul Cheese?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">When the name cropped up in an email recently, it rang bells. Paul Cheese. There&#8217;s a memorable name. The email in question was not from Paul but from a chap called Richard Weston. Richard&#8217;s name is, like mine, not too memorable although you may remember him as, back in 2017, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="he invited me to Brussels to speak at a EuroVelo event (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2017/09/15/brussels-eurovelo-5-bicycles-rain-sun-beer/" target="_blank">he invited me to Brussels to speak at a EuroVelo event</a> that he was organising. Richard is one of the world&#8217;s few academics who specialises in cycle tourism and he heads <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the Institute of Transport &amp; Tourism at the University of Central Lancashire (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.uclan.ac.uk/research/explore/groups/institute_transport_tourism_itt.php" target="_blank">the Institute of Transport &amp; Tourism at the University of Central Lancashire</a>. &#8216;<em>Would you like to attend a similar event in Scotland in November?</em>&#8216; he asked. It turns out the event is about the development of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="EuroVelo 1 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/european-routes/eurovelo-1/" target="_blank">EuroVelo 1</a> &#8216;Atlantic Route&#8217; as a long-distance cycle route. Having cycled significant chunks of the route back in 2015 when I pedalled from Tarifa to Nordkapp, he thought I might be an appropriate person to speak to the delegates. So, in the first week of November, I&#8217;m off to Balloch &#8211; on the shores of Loch Lomond &#8211; to do just that. Paul Cheese has also been invited to speak. <em>Where had I heard that name before?</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I searched CyclingEurope.org. No results. It appeared that I had never mentioned Paul Cheese on this site before. Curious. I left in there and resolved to do a little more digging before I headed north to Scotland. Fast forward to last Sunday evening. I&#8217;m sitting working at the computer, half listening to Jim Al-Khalili select his <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="'Pick of the Week' on Radio 4 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0009jft" target="_blank">&#8216;Pick of the Week&#8217; on Radio 4</a> and the following &#8216;highlight&#8217; from Jim wafts through the air:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cheese.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Paul Cheese! Cycle touring&#8230; audio recording&#8230; That rang more bells. I started searching again but there was no email in my inbox from Paul Cheese, just a message response from me via Twitter to Paul&#8217;s Twitter account saying &#8220;<em>Hi! Yes, would be nice if you could write an article about your trip. It will perhaps be a bit of publicity for your music 🙂</em>&#8220;. It was dated December 2013 but there was no message prior to that one. <em>Was I responding to one of Paul&#8217;s tweets?</em> I scrolled back to 2013&#8230; but the oldest tweet on his timeline was from November 2016.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Clearly we had exchanged &#8211; probably now deleted &#8211; messages nearly six years ago but, thanks to Paul&#8217;s memorable name, it had stuck in my mind. Cue a little <em>more</em> digging online and I find Paul&#8217;s website where he explains all:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Hi, I’m Paul Cheese&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>On May 26th&nbsp;this year, I set out to discover what the UK sounds like.</em></p><p><em>I cycled almost 5000 miles – to every region of the UK to capture the sounds of people and places.

<p>And here is Paul&#8217;s piece of music in its entirety:</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="TheBigRecordUK Sound Of The UK 2019 by Paul Cheese" width="890" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F696244836&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=890&#038;maxheight=1000&#038;dnt=1"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">That&#8217;s rather beautiful, no? It&#8217;s always nice to have a project to combine with the cycle touring. For me it&#8217;s the writing and the photography. For Paul, it&#8217;s recording the sounds that he hears. I look forward to meeting Paul in Scotland in November. I might even do a bit of sound recording myself and interview him for the podcast&#8230;</p>
