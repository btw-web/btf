<h1>Bespoke Bicycles: Self-Building?</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the back of my mind, I&#8217;ve been thinking about my list of requirements for a bespoke bicycle that I would dearly love to have built before I travel to cycle the length of Japan in 2020. I have yet to write down a definite list &#8211; perhaps I never will &#8211; but I have located a potential builder, <a href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2018/07/11/bespoke-touring-bicycles-woodrup-cycles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Woodrup Cycles in Leeds</a>, and, crucially, started saving. Ultimately, that might be the biggest hurdle as custom bikes are wincingly expensive. However, whether it be literal or metaphorical one, every long journey started with one step so I&#8217;m not going to let the obvious barriers to purchasing my own bespoke bicycle stop me from thinking about doing so. Hold that thought&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know where you come from. Apologies; that does sound a little sinister. I should perhaps say <em>I know where a few of you come from</em>. There is a small box in the &#8216;stats&#8217; section of this website (that only I can see) called &#8216;referrer&#8217;. It does what it says on the tin and allows me to see where you, the visitors to this website, have clicked on a link to get you here. The vast majority of you come from search engines (although Google clamped down on revealing search terms a few years ago so I no longer see those) and social media. However, a handful of you arrive here after clicking a link on another cycling / travel website. These links sometimes throw up a gem and I just found another one: <a href="https://www.bikeramble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BikeRamble.com</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">BikeRamble.com is the website of cyclist and traveller Jamie Anderson. Jamie is travelling the world in what appears to be a fairly leisurely fashion and has been doing so for several years. He describes himself as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;This weirdo has cycled more than 25,000km on his touring bike in over 30 countries. He doesn&#8217;t take planes and hasn&#8217;t stepped inside a car for over 3 years. He also, apparently, cuts his own hair.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His latest posts reveal that he is currently in <a href="https://www.bikeramble.com/cycling-tbilisi-to-baku-part-2-azerbaijan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azerbaijan</a>. <a href="https://www.bikeramble.com/stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">His list of statistics</a> about his cycling makes interesting reading. The person who came to CyclingEurope.org via BikeRamble.com had done so via a link on <a href="https://www.bikeramble.com/cycling-barcelona-valencia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this page of Jamie&#8217;s website</a> where he writes about his experiences of cycling from Barcelona to Valencia. (Thanks for the link Jamie.) Anyway, back to the point and, bicycles&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jamie has a bespoke bike and <a href="https://www.bikeramble.com/bicycle-timelapse-video-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this page of his website is fascinating</a>. I&#8217;ll leave you to peruse it in detail but it makes me think. I&#8217;m no mechanic but should I be taking a more hands-on approach to realising my ambition to own a bespoke bicycle. Should I, in effect, try building one for myself? Thoughts, as ever, welcome.</p>
<p>Here is Jamie in action, building his bike in a video from the <a href="https://vimeo.com/bikeramble" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bike Ramble Vimeo page</a>:</p>
