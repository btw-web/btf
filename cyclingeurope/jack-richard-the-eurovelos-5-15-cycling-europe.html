<h1>Jack, Richard &amp; The Eurovelos 5 &amp; 15</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An email has arrived from Jack who fancies cycling around Europe&#8230; He writes in blue, I write in red. Well, I am a teacher, albeit one with a sniffly nose today. And on the day that Francois Hollande becomes the French president, it does give this post a very French look&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em><strong>Hi, Richard.</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Hi Jack!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em><strong>My name is Jack, from England.</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">My name is Andrew (not Richard), from England too.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em><strong>I am very keen on cycling around Europe next summer, and noticed your blog online, and thought it might be a good idea to contact you about some queries I have!</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Excellent. I love receiving emails from people who have visited CyclingEurope.org &amp; I don&#8217;t hold it against them when they get my name wrong.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em><strong>Firstly, I am interested in starting in Amsterdam, and doing a loop involving Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France, and some more countries too, and finishing back in Amsterdam. I am not too sure if this fits into any specific routes on Euro Velo or not, but I am keen to try it.</strong></em></span></p>

I like the vague &#8216;&#8230;and some more countries too&#8217; which implies your attitude towards detailed planning is similar to my own. Well, I can&#8217;t speak for the unnamed countries, but if you are heading south from Amsterdam towards Italy, it might be a good idea to consider the Rhine Cycle Route or Eurovelo 15 as it has now become. There is some information about the route on the <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/the-other-eurovelos/eurovelo-15/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff0000;">CyclingEurope.org Eurovelo 12 page</span></a> but I suggest you will find much more by searching for &#8216;Rhine Cycle Route&#8217; online. It does what it says on the tin; follows the route of the Rhine as shown here. The other route you might want to consider is the Eurovelo 5 of course, the one that I followed from southern England to southern Italy although this is a bit further west &#8211; the other side of Belgium (I changed my route slightly to avoid Brussels for no other reason than I wanted to make a bit of headway in the first week or so of my trip) &#8211; and anyway, it links up with the Rhine Cycle Route / Eurovelo 15 as soon as it arrives in Strasbourg. Both routes enter Switzerland via Basel but whereas the Eurovelo 15 continues to follow the course of the Rhine taking a long loop towards the east, the Eurovelo 5 heads straight across Switzerland towards the Gotthard Pass following Swiss cycle route number 3. Once in Italy, I suppose it depends what you &#8216;other countries&#8217; are.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em><strong>Anyway, I was wondering if you knew if it would be realistic to stay in cheap campsites for my trip? Or even wild camping? By cheap, I mean around 10 Euros a night. I will be on a budget.</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Cheap camp-sites? There are hundreds of them across Europe! Most towns in France have at the very least a &#8216;camping municipal&#8217; or a site that&#8217;s owned by the local council where you will pay (usually) well under €10 for a pitch for a small tent. The Rhine Cycle Route website will give you information about the sites through which it passes and there is an excellent website for travellers on foot, bicycle &amp; even rollerblading (!) that covers the whole of Switzerland. <a href="http://www.veloland.ch/en/welcome.cfm" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Take a look by following this link</span></a>. Wild camping? The problem is that Europe is not that wild&#8230; Perhaps in the more remote areas in the mountains. You might be better registering with <a href="http://www.warmshowers.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff0000;">WarmShowers.org</span></a>, the website for travelling cyclists where you can ask fellow travelling cyclists if you can stay in their house or pitch your tent in their garden. Of course <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff0000;">CouchSurfing.org</span></a> serves a similar audience of more general travellers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em><strong>Also, were such cheap campsites easy to come by, like within a day&#8217;s cycling? I plan to spend around 2500 Euros on the trip, feasible?</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Yes, they are everywhere! €2,500 sounds like a pretty good sum to me but ultimately it depends upon how many weeks you are going to be cycling for&#8230; How long is a piece of string? A budget of €30 euros per day for everything &#8211; accommodation &amp; food mainly I suppose &#8211; plus a contingency for any emergencies whether they be technical or because you can&#8217;t find anywhere to stay overnight except a hotel should be OK. If you have more lavish tastes, then perhaps not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em><strong>What kind of bike did you use? I am unsure which bike would be good for such a long trip. I am not keen on too many mountainous roads. The easier the better really.</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">My bike, the famous Reggie Ridgeback as mentioned in the title of my book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-Vibrations-Crossing-Europe-ebook/dp/B005HHSY4U" target="_blank"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em><strong>Good Vibrations: Crossing Europe on a Bike Called Reggie</strong></em></span></a> is, as you might guess, a Ridgeback Panorama. Apart from a few issues with spokes, it/he suited my needs perfectly. That said, I could probably have successfully completed the trip on a much cheaper bike. The road surfaces were fine, even high in the mountains. It goes back to what I said above about Europe not being much of a &#8216;wild&#8217; place anymore, certainly not Western Europe.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em><strong>Anyway, I appreciate any time you can spare for my questions.</strong></em><em><strong><br />
</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">It was a pleasure. Gives me something to do while I&#8217;m off work with a cold&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em><strong>Thanks,</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em><strong>Jack.</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Richard, sorry, Andrew!</span></p>
