<h1>The Butterfly Effect: UPDATE</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following on from <a href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2019/01/27/the-cycling-europe-cycle-touring-photograph-of-the-year-competition-2019-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the previous post</a>, it appears to be &#8216;update Sunday&#8217;&#8230; Here&#8217;s another, reflecting upon the reaction to my post of a few days ago: <a href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2019/01/20/the-butterfly-effect-the-dawes-karakum-the-koga-world-traveller-and-the-koga-grand-tourer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Butterfly Effect</a>. Before reading on, you may want to hop back to that post to read what I said at the time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Done? Good&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;We have the</em>  <em>World Traveller e-bikes. Bought in the summer. I was disappointed at not being able to have the butterfly bars but they couldn’t be changed due to the electrical components.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I still have a few years in my legs before I head down the electric bike route but I don&#8217;t doubt that the day will come. That said, Chris quips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;By the time you’ve saved up roughly £4000 </em><em>, you’ll have to consider upgrading to an e-bike because you’ll be that much older&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>John comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;My own bike is a Surly Ogre and I love it, but about 10 years ago I found a female Dawes town bike which had been dumped in a lay by. I took it to the police and after the required 28-day period collected it for my wife. It has served both my wife and my daughter, for commuting and touring and has never cost a penny.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ann Wilson, who you will know from the Cycle Touring festival had her hand built Roberts bike stolen when travelling round the World. She bought a cheap replacement and continued with that bike and has travelled extensively since with the cheaper model.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tom Allen has written a few articles about people doing amazing journeys on bikes that have been picked up at the tip.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>It&#8217;s all personal choice at the end of the day, but I certainly wouldn’t discount the Dawes.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Have you considered Jones bars? I have them on my Surly and a Salsa Timberjack which I use for bike packing. I can honestly say they are the best thing I’ve ever fitted to my bikes.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">John makes a good point: spending lots of money on a bike doesn&#8217;t guarantee a successful long-distance adventure, far from it. But I would add that we tend to hear the stories of adversity where a lucky individual has, for whatever reason, used a bicycle that would have otherwise have ended up on the scrap heap and subsequently cycled round the world on it. We don&#8217;t tend to hear of those cyclists who adopted a similar approach but had to abandon all plans very quickly. And it&#8217;s worth remembering that for every cheap second-hand bike to exist, there needs to be a more expensive brand-new bike made and bought. Surly Ogres don&#8217;t come cheap but perhaps John&#8217;s will one day get around the world when it is old and rusty. As for the Jones bars&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;has anyone else used them?</p>
<p>Rob Ainsley &#8211; <a href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2019/01/16/in-the-bleak-mid-winter-cycling-the-calder-valley-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who I met recently</a> &#8211; writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;I have three bikes I use for touring, each with a different style bar – drop, butterfly, flat. When selecting which one to use for a trip, the prospective feel of each on the likely surfaces is definitely as much a part of the decision process as other factors such as suspension, tyre width etc.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Butterfly bars are much more common on touring bikes on the continent than here; in the UK we are keener on drop bars. So it seems to me, any road. Anyone know why the difference? Is it just a cultural thing?&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Good question. Is it because we see the drop handlebar as the pinnacle of the bicycle design and, despite its obvious unsuitability for long-distance touring, we feel obliged to keep using them? Answers on a postcard. Or better still, below, in the comment box.</p>
<p>And finally, the humble opinion of Pagan Cidergod:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;About 10 years ago I paid £300 for a Dawes Kalahari. It has taken me from Worcester to Istanbul 1¾ times (I ran out of time in Macedonia on the first trip), both times carrying 4 well-stuffed panniers and a tent. Naming their bikes after deserts implies suitability for travel and having ridden it for years I don’t see that a more expensive bike could be an improvement. IMHO, of course.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you think?</p>
