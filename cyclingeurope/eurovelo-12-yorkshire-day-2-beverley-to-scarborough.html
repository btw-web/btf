<h1>EuroVelo 12 &#8211; Yorkshire, Day 2: Beverley To Scarborough</h1>
<p>That was a long ride but a very good one indeed. Not without its frustrations or challenges, but the best rides are so much better because of them, especially from the perspective of a belly full of curried spaghetti in a youth hostel in Scarborough. My only complaint is that there is a girl outside the youth hostel who is excessively high on life and has provided an annoying background audio track of continuous hysterical giggling ever since I walked into this building. She has just this moment walked upstairs with her friends. My hope is that she doesn&#8217;t return. Anyway&#8230; back to the cycling.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember following such a well signposted route. Did I say that yesterday? Probably. If I did, it&#8217;s worth repeating. Only once today did I make a mistake. If you want to take the stress out of route-finding, the Wolds Cycle Route / Sustrans Route 1 (in Yorkshire) / EuroVelo 12 (ditto) is the one for you. It doesn&#8217;t always follow the most direct of routes but the lanes that it does adopt are worthy of the detours. Quiet &#8211; often deserted &#8211; country roads that are well surfaced and that allow &#8211; encourage event &#8211; frequent pauses along the way just to stop and stare at the view.</p>
<p>The villages north of Wetherby ooze money. So close to the run-down estates of Hull to make a stark comparison between the two ends of the spectrum of wealth that exists in Britain in 2019&#8230;</p>
<p>BREAKING NEWS: Those girls have reappeared ffs&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;and what&#8217;s guessing that both the landed gentry of Beverley and its environs and the &#8216;underclass&#8217; (Tony Blair&#8217;s word not mine) in the impoverished housing estates both voted en masse for Brexit. Sigh&#8230; When will sanity prevail?</p>
<p>The only shower arrived just before I arrived in Great Driffield. I note it is just plain old Driffield on my map. As I noted earlier, it was OK. But great? That&#8217;s pushing it. The Secret Garden café gave me shelter inside and Wanda shelter under the awning and I spent a ponderous half hour listening to two old ladies discussing which of their friends had died in the previous week. It was a shockingly large number.</p>
<p>I crossed the railway line from Beverley to Bridlington and beyond a comically large number of times. They did at least make it easy to follow my progress on the (excellent) Sustrans maps that I&#8217;ve been using:</p>

<p>The series covers the entire country and they are well worth the investment of a few pounds.</p>
<p>Bridlington had me entering Desmond Morris people-watching mode. There&#8217;s an old part to Bridlington &#8211; didn&#8217;t they film the recent Dad&#8217;s Army film there? &#8211; which is very pretty, but it rapidly descended into amusement arcade / fish &#8216;n&#8217; chips / dilapidated building horror by the coast. The less said the better. At least it wasn&#8217;t as bad as Blackpool but that&#8217;s a bit like saying at least Fred West wasn&#8217;t as bad as Harold Shipman. The best view of Bridlington promenade is from afar:</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/img_4713.jpg?w=890&#038;ssl=1" class="size-full" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Moving on&#8230; the twisting, deviating nature of the route shortly after Bridlington had me heading south west and into a brutal wind. Distance-wise it wasn&#8217;t too long. Time-wise it was an eternity. There&#8217;s a small part of me still there fighting the elements. The reward came when I readopted the default cycling direction of heading towards the north east and I started flying rather than cycling.</p>
<p>The cycling sign-posted &#8217;10 miles&#8217; from Bridlington compared to the cycling sign-posted &#8217;10 miles&#8217; to Scarborough (at the alleged half-way point) was clearly measured by two people with widely different ideas as to what constitutes &#8217;10 miles&#8217;. Fortunately the &#8217;10 miles&#8217; to Scarborough was the shorter of the two and before you could say &#8216;bracing&#8217;, I had dismounted and was admiring the sweep of the South Bay from a lofty position. The town is much, much better than how it previously existed in my mind. Classy. Well maintained. Chic even. And a world away from Bridlington, although probably not 20 miles&#8230;</p>
<p>Tomorrow is much shorter than today&#8217;s 110km; 40km along the Cinder Track to Whitby which should hopefully give me a little more time to explore the gothic wonders of Yorkshire&#8217;s most atmospheric town.</p>
