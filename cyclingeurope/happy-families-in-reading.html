<h1>Happy Families In Reading</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I love eavesdropping on conversations in cafés. It&#8217;s like cutting into a cake; you only see one little bit of the cake (or hear about one little bit if someone&#8217;s life) but you make assumptions about the 99.99% you can&#8217;t see (hear about) based upon what you do.<br />
I&#8217;m in a café &#8211; Bella Italia &#8211; in Reading and there are four conversations taking place around me. Behind me is a 48-year-old guy who is on a first date with a woman who came to Reading because she found a job here. He is explaining all there is to know about Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. He&#8217;s a sufferer himself (and his sisters suspect that they are). He thinks his mother probably was ( but apparently it can jump a generation as it is a hereditary condition). His date hasn&#8217;t yet said a word and I&#8217;m thinking she may not give him a chance to explain more on a second one&#8230;<br />
Ahead of me is an older woman with a younger man. I know this for definite as she noted earlier that &#8216;when I was your age&#8230;&#8217;. They don&#8217;t know each other well. Perhaps they are students on the same course? Both are foreigners, southern European I think or perhaps even south American. It&#8217;s quite an intense chat about families and the relationships that exist within families. Perhaps they are sociologists at a conference at the university. That&#8217;ll do.<br />
The couple and their young child in the corner have just left. She was very good-looking and he wasn&#8217;t. He ate with his mouth open whereas she daintily picked at the olives they had ordered with a tooth pick. She didn&#8217;t have much to say for herself which means that she&#8217;s probably a bit dim and she married the oaf opposite her for reasons of money. He is called Adi by the way. He was wearing a T-shirt with the words &#8216;Adi does&#8217; (such wit!) on the front. I bet his wife wishes he didn&#8217;t but she&#8217;ll no doubt put up with him for the foreseeable future.<br />
The last twosome is to my right. A young grandmother and her ten-year-old granddaughter. They are Spanish and they are playing the card game happy families. In a way that&#8217;s what Adi &amp; his wife are doing and what the guy on his first date would like to do doing. The South American sociologists are just talking about it&#8230;<a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jaques-happy-families-1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9184" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2013/05/05/happy-families-in-reading/jaques-happy-families-1/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jaques-happy-families-1.jpg?fit=870%2C304&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="870,304" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="jaques-happy-families-1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jaques-happy-families-1.jpg?fit=300%2C105&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jaques-happy-families-1.jpg?fit=870%2C304&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9184" alt="jaques-happy-families-1" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jaques-happy-families-1.jpg?resize=500%2C174" width="500" height="174" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
