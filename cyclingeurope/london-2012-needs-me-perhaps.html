As I had heard nothing for many months, I was beginning to wonder if I had been passed over. To their credit, London 2012 sent the occasional email assuring me that I hadn&#8217;t but it was a little disheartening to receive an email on the 21st September that read <em>&#8216;Exciting news! After months of selection events and interviews, today we start making offers to London 2012 Games Makers</em>.&#8217; Not very exciting for me&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, my sense of rejection was misplaced! Earlier this week I received an email doing exactly what it said on the tin. It was entitled <em>&#8216;Well done! You have an interview!</em>&#8216;. Great 🙂 It went on; &#8220;<em>Congratulations, you are one step closer to becoming a London 2012 Games Maker! We have reviewed your application and would like to invite you to a selection event at ExCeL, London. The event will take around 90 minutes and will include a 30-minute interview for the Transport team</em>.&#8221; Very, very exciting!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the links provided, I booked myself in for a selection event on the 3rd November at 5pm. Although I&#8217;m at work that day, I only teach in the morning so should be able to escape early to get down to London in good time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Transport Team. What would that involve? Well, full details at the <a href="http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/volunteer/games-maker-roles-and-venues/teams-and-roles/transport.php" target="_blank">Games Maker website</a> but here is one section that sums it up quite well: the good and the bad or as they put it;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>The highs&#8230;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Some drivers will get to drive important members of the Games Family. Some roles will be located in competition venues and Olympic Villages, which means you could also be providing services for some of the world’s best athletes.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>&#8230;and possible lows</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Many roles will be located away from competition venues and will require you to stand for long periods outdoors, come rain or shine. Our services operate around the clock, so expect early starts and late finishes.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I can cope with early starts and late finishes. I have after all been practising as a teacher for the last ten years. As for rain and shine, well, my cycle along the Eurovelo 5 was perfect preparation!</span></p>
