The old guy who is the part-time projectionist at <a href="http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/cinema/Regal_Picturehouse/" target="_blank">Henley Regal Cinema</a> took me on a guided tour of the projection room which was fascinating. The kids were watching the French film <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0463872/" target="_blank">Astérix Aux Jeux Olympiques</a></em> and it was being shown via an old-style projector dating from the 1970s pictured here (the projectionist&#8217;s finger, not mine &#8211; he kept tapping &amp; poking the film and I was terrified it would all suddenly get chewed up by the mechanism in a frenzied shower of film and there would be cries of horror from the auditorium below) but it was equally interesting to see the ultra-modern 3D polarising projectors that have been installed over the last couple of years. Our film had arrived in six film cans and each spool had to be connected together prior to the showing; <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201607/" target="_blank">Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, Part II</a></em> arrived by courier while I was having a coffee after my behind-the-scenes visit in the café in the foyer&#8230; on a hard disk delivered in a cardboard box. Mmm&#8230; I told the projectionist he really should watch the film <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095765/" target="_blank">Cinema Paradiso</a></em> which, despite his many years of doing what he does, he had never seen. He promised to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyway, there is news about Reggie! As I was walking up the hill back to school with my 90 cinema-going pupils, I received a call from <a href="http://www.awcycles.co.uk/" target="_blank">A.W. Cycles</a>. New back wheel, new chain &amp; cassette, new cables, new brakes, general service (is there anything left to service?) plus labour will set me back £280. Gulp. I must keep reminding myself that £280 would probably only buy me three or four full tanks of petrol in an averaged-sized car. Or a fraction of the cost of a car service. Or indeed the insurance&#8230; I authorised the work to be done and I should be back cycling to and from work for the last few days of the academic year next week. £280 does, however, make me think I should make the most of my investment and escape somewhere by bike for a few days over the summer holidays.</p>
