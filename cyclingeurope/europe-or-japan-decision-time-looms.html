<p class="has-text-color has-background has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify has-very-light-gray-color has-vivid-red-background-color">So&#8230; what&#8217;s up next? Well, we have the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="UCI World Championships (opens in a new tab)" href="https://worlds.yorkshire.com/the-races/" target="_blank">UCI World Championships</a></span></strong> here in Yorkshire this coming week and I&#8217;d like to venture over to one of the nearby starting points (Bradford or Leeds) and perhaps even the Harrogate &#8216;loop&#8217; to see some of the cycling action. I have a little trip to Scotland planned in early November along the lines of my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="EuroVelo-related visit to Belgium (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2017/09/19/official-launch-of-the-eurovelo-5-via-romea-francigena-app/" target="_blank"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EuroVelo-related visit to Belgium</span></strong></a> a couple of years ago. Then there are a couple of speaking engagements in early 2020 and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Cycle Touring Festival (opens in a new tab)" href="http://cycletouringfestival.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cycle Touring Festival</span></strong></a> in May&#8230; </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">But I&#8217;m thinking of next summer and the possibility of another end-to-end ride that&#8217;s worthy of me putting pen to paper and writing another book. It is, of course, the natural progression from investing in a new bicycle &#8211; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Wanda, the Koga WorldTraveller (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2019/06/30/wanda-the-koga-signature-worldtraveller-up-close-personal/" target="_blank">Wanda, the Koga WorldTraveller</a> &#8211; and heading off to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Spain and Portugal this summer (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2019/09/15/cycling-europe-2019-21-days-of-travelling-in-20-videos/" target="_blank">Spain and Portugal this summer</a> to test her out. Indeed the purchase of a new bike was <strong><em>because</em></strong> I want to do more end-to-end rides and write books about them. It&#8217;s not so much a case of &#8216;<em>if</em>&#8216; as a case of &#8216;<em>when</em>&#8216; and &#8216;<em>where</em>&#8216;. The answer to those two questions really needs to be delivered in the next few months and certainly before the end of 2019.</p>



<p>The two options are:</p>



<ul><li>Somewhere end-to-end in Europe (again&#8230;) or</li><li>Japan, top to bottom</li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Clearly there are other feasible options out there, but for 2020, these are the two that I am currently weighing up. One option is on my doorstep and logistically relatively straightforward; the other is far away and logistically more problematic. I have no idea which of the two will finally win out although I think the European option (despite Brexit&#8230;) is more likely even if my preference would be for Japan. Other factors &#8211; time and money primarily &#8211; need to take precedence over my mere emotional desires. I hate to disappoint but, by continuing to read this post, you are not going to find me making a decision today.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">However, it is emails from people like Tamás that get me thinking. Tamás is, I think, from Hungary, and he noticed that I had written here on CyclingEurope.org about the possibility of cycling the length of Japan in 2020. You can too by visiting <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="this page of the site (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/japan2020/" target="_blank">this page of the site</a>&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/japan-2020-2.m4v"></video></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8230;although I think the &#8216;coming soon&#8217; bit in the video should have included the caveat &#8216;perhaps&#8217;. After introducing himself, Tamás offered his advice:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;I  last year in 5500km avoiding the big cities. I am not sure what kind of trip you are planning but if you have any questions and you think I might be able to answer then do not hesitate to ask. I was doing camping almost all the way.&#8221;</em></p><cite>Tamás B</cite></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Eager to find out what he had to say, I responded and Tamás has just emailed back with some very useful pieces of advice as well as links to online resources. Over to you Tamás!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I can recommend the following websites since I have found them very useful before and during my trip&#8230;</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.japancycling.org/v2/cguide/" target="_blank">JapanCycling.org</a> &#8211; Lots if useful information</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1ZBVjXbJKXFgt7AFBFQlSn5Zx3to&amp;hl=en_US&amp;ll=43.77915657802342%2C142.4346060202638&amp;z=7" target="_blank">Free camping, hot springs and Mich-no-Eki in Japan</a> &#8211; The Michi no Eki network is quite handy in Japan and during my trip only 1 of the campings was not available from the map. Unfortunately the map does not says what kind of camping is it. The car campings in Japan don&#8217;t really like cycle tourers and might not let you stay. And they are expensive.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.windfinder.com/#14/45.8501/6.8765/2019-05-31T06:00Z" target="_blank">Windfinder</a> &#8211; Lets face it&#8230; Wind can make your day pretty bad when you are cycling&#8230;</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sakuramobile.jp/lp/?i=psim&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI27Xh6Lrx2AIV6rXtCh1h_wp1EAAYASAAEgK00PD_BwE" target="_blank">Sakura Mobile</a> &#8211; You can&#8217;t buy a SIM card in Japan and the roaming is super expensive so I had this Sakura data SIM card and it was brilliant. With a data SIM you can and should use Google Maps (GM). </li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I used GM and Open Street Map (OSM) as well since OSM works offline and it can show you the elevation as well so you will see how hard your day will be 🙂&nbsp; Furthermore GM was a big help to find spots when I was doing wild camping. I am not sure what kind of trip is in your mind but I was doing camping almost all the way and my trip ended up being 5500km in about 63 days, daily average 100km cycling. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I would have to check my bank statements to give you exact number but I think I did not spend more than €2000 during my time in Japan and I have visited lots of place there. My flight ticket was €750. You should try and fly with British Airways because with them you can take your bike for free. On the way back I had to pay €200 to Japan Airlines.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">AirBnB is widely available and not expensive; I never paid more for a night than €30. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">If you are cycling in Japan water and public toilets are everywhere and they are clean as well. You can was your clothes with coin washers. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Taking your bike on public transport is a challenge since you have to take it apart, and this is the main reason I did not use public transport at all.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">There are small supermarkets at every stop so you do not have to carry much food on the bike BUT&#8230; I suggest if you get food from supermarkets (they have ready to eat food and it is quite good as well; they heat it up for you) you should eat it right there because there are no bins in Japan. Seriously. Basically these shops are your only chance to get rid of your rubbish. And these shops (at least 7Eleven&#8230;) are the places you are going to get your cash as well since they have ATMs. You have to use cash because they do not really use card terminals. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The traffic is super safe in Japan (I did not go to Tokyo though so that might be crazy). As I can see on your map you have planned the shortest route possible and I am pretty sure before you go you will change it here and there but let me say that the Japanese coast line is kind of boring. There are plenty of nice places as well but one fishing village is the same as the rest. That is the reason my trip was over 5000km with lots of mountains. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I was planning my trip all the way making a map with day-by-day schedule but on the first week it turned out it was a waste of time. Every night I was planning the next day keeping in mind that I have to cycle around 100km. Another thing&#8230; You should learn some basic Japanese. It happened many times with me that people started to talk to me in Japanese like they were sure that I am speaking that language and I do actually speak a bit of Japanese but it could be very frustrating. In big cities young people probably speak some English but I did not meet many of them. I am pretty sure I have more to tell but this is what I have now. If you have any specific question just ask.</p>



<p>Tamás B</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">What a wonderfully useful email to receive and many thanks to Tamás for taking the time to send it. Lots of really practical information about a trip that he clearly thoroughly enjoyed. &#8220;<em>I might go back next year to do some cycling on a different route&#8221;</em> he added to his original email. That, I suppose, is the ultimate endorsement. You never know; I might even meet him&#8230;</p>



<p>So, Europe or Japan? I did warn you not to expect a decision quite yet&#8230;</p>
