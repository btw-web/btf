<h1>More research, more questions!</h1>
<p>40 years ago today, Man first walked on the Moon. I walked home from Reading earlier this afternoon counting the number of people I passed who I thought were likely candidates for an adventure cycling to southern Italy. I counted zero. So on a day that we celebrate the achievements of Neil, Buzz and Michael, Reading (the bit that I walked through anyway) couldn&#8217;t supply any adventurers anywhere near their calibre. Except me of course. 🙂<br />Back to the planning: more window shopping today. Well, more than window shopping as it has involved entering the shops and actually having discussions with shop assistants. Who I have to say, knew their stuff. It&#8217;s nice to get the chance to shop during the week. At the weekend, shops tend to be staffed by kids who know very little about anything. So that is good.<br />Two shops visited today, well three actually but one was shut: Carters of Reading (boo). Blacks in the town centre is a cracking store (and doesn&#8217;t shut on any day of the week &#8211; Carters take note!) and has an excellent selection of camping gear. Remember that I am after a tent which is light and compact when rolled up. The Blacks Octane 1 fits the bill&#8230; but it is £149.99. My budget for a tent had been £100. 1.75kg, wraps up in a pack 12 x 45 cm. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">TGO</span> &#8211; the magazine (&#8220;The Great Outdoors&#8221;) &#8211; is quoted &#8220;The inner porch is spacious with good head room and the interior is quite roomy&#8221;. Need to go back to Cotswold Leisure before I decide which one to go for (see previous post). The second shop was my bike shop of choice: AW Cycles in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Caversham</span>. Had a good chat with a guy in there about panniers and front bar bags.We both agreed that my current set of panniers were not suitable for anything other than a commute to Henley with kids&#8217; exercise books. They can get over their books being ruined due to rain. I would not be a happy camper if that were to happen to my belongings en route to Yorkshire. A set of better replacements was identified &#8211; <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Altura</span> Orkney Panniers. I suppose the choice of a group of islands not known for being particularly dry is a good indication that they will put up with what the Peak District can throw at me. Size wise they are almost identical to the current panniers. Question: is that enough? 34 litres. The tent would sit on the rack rather than in the bad itself which would then be used for everything else. I have half an eye on cycling to Italy next year on this one: I don&#8217;t want to have to buy even more panniers next year, although if I did, I could opt for some for the front wheels. I wonder what litre-age Mark Beaumont has? Time for an Internet search! The following is from an Edinburgh shop&#8217;s website about one of their bags: &#8220;&#8230;on the principle that 28 litres is enough to carry on any bike&#8221;. Elsewhere, somebody actually refers to the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Altura</span> Orkney panniers by name noting that they are &#8220;&#8230;handily sized at 34 litres the pair for taking Far Too Much Stuff on tour&#8221;. That cryptic bit at the end using capitalisation escapes me. Searching under the name of the product I find a whole host of places selling the panniers significantly cheaper than AW Cycles (whose price is £89.99). <a href="http://www.cyclestore.co.uk/">CycleStore.co.uk</a> for example sell them at £66.54. I seem to have found some good panniers but not where to buy them!</p>
