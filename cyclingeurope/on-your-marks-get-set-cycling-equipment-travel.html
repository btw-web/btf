The flight is purchased and the Spanish course booked but you already know that as <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/2015/02/10/the-spanish-plan-february-march-2015/" target="_blank">you have read this</a>, no? Yesterday I spent the day in Leeds in search of some of the &#8216;equipment&#8217; I need to get hold of before I leave, notably the <a href="http://www.mountain-equipment.co.uk/firefox-jacket" target="_blank">Mountain Equipment Firefox jacket</a> that <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/2015/01/18/the-mountain-equipment-firefox-jacket-mtnequipment-cotswoldreading/" target="_blank">I mentioned a few weeks ago</a> (now discounted in <a href="http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/mountain-equipment-mens-firefox-jacket-11111499" target="_blank">Cotswold Outdoor</a>) along with an <a href="http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/icebreaker-mens-oasis-long-sleeve-crewe-19110254?id_colour=3322" target="_blank">Icebreaker merino base layer</a>, a nice <a href="http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/mountain-equipment-plain-knitted-beanie-1c110137?id_colour=105" target="_blank">beanie</a> and a &#8216;<a href="http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/buff-polar-buff-reversible-2d810007?id_colour=161" target="_blank">buff</a>&#8216; (all with those potentially chilly days in Spain in April and Norway in July in mind), a pair of Endura &#8216;8-panel Lycra mesh liner&#8217; padded cycling undershorts to wear with a normal pair of shorts or trousers from <a href="http://www.evanscycles.com/products/endura/8-panel-clickfast-liner-ec022289" target="_blank">Evans Cycles</a> (if they are good I&#8217;ll probably buy another pair at some point) and a replacement <a href="http://www.blacks.co.uk/equipment/105520-victorinox-explorer-pocket-knife-assorted.html" target="_blank">Swiss Army knife from Blacks</a> (the scissor function being problematic on the old one). Oh, and a book about the modern history of Spain from Waterstone&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/giles+tremlett/ghosts+of+spain/8661569/" target="_blank">Ghosts of Spain</a>. (And two pints of beer.) I should also be receiving at some point today* (yes, get ready to groan&#8230;) the black Ortlieb Classic Roller Plus panniers (with QL2.1!) that <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/2015/01/18/the-ortlieb-roller-classic-plus-pannier-with-ql2-1-cycling-equipment-panniers/" target="_blank">I mentioned a while back</a>. Not the most essential of things in that I already have a perfectly serviceable set of Ortlieb Roller Plus panniers (without QL2.1), albeit with a slightly twisted support in the case of one of the rear bags.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let&#8217;s move on to something that is essential: travel insurance. I already have worldwide bike insurance from <a href="https://bikmoplus.com/" target="_blank">Bikmo</a> and I was expecting to use <a href="http://www.hbinsurance.co.uk/" target="_blank">Harrison Beaumont</a> for the travel insurance. I used them when I cycled along the Mediterranean in 2013 and the product was a good one (although thankfully I didn&#8217;t need to use it). I was expecting to use the same company for this year&#8217;s trip but the Harrison Beaumont insurance didn&#8217;t come cheap &#8211; about £250 I seem to remember &#8211; so I did a quick search and was surprised to find much cheaper options available. The length of the trip &#8211; in my case six months including the period in Cadiz &#8211; is always an issue, or rather I thought it was. Using <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/compare/travelinsurance" target="_blank">Google comparison</a> a whole string of travel insurers were listed and having looked through them I didn&#8217;t go with the cheapest (just £80) but with a company called <a href="http://www.erv.co.uk/products/cycle-triathlon-insurance/touring-cycle-insurance/#.VNxw1VOsW5I" target="_blank">ERV who sell a specialist touring cyclist insurance</a> and who were able to sell me their product for the comparatively low cost of £144. Why did I not find them two years ago?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing that somebody might be able to offer me advice upon is how I can use my mobile phone cost effectively during those six months. I&#8217;ve been thinking a bit about this recently and I have concocted the following plan&#8230; Back in 2013 I abandoned Orange (now EE of course) in favour of Vodafone for two reasons. The first is <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/2010/09/18/oranges-lemons/" target="_blank">this</a> (I&#8217;ll just leave you to read the details via that link but needless to say it lead to me abandoning my Orange contract as soon as I was able to do so) and the second is <a href="http://www.vodafone.co.uk/shop/pay-monthly/travelling-abroad/vodafone-eurotraveller/index.htm" target="_blank">this</a>, the Vodafone Euro Traveller product. In 2013 whilst cycling &#8216;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Along-Med-Bike-Called-Reggie/dp/1849145059/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423733548&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Along the Med</a>&#8216; (not bought the book yet?!) I paid £3 every day to <img data-attachment-id="96992" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2015/02/12/on-your-marks-get-set-cycling-equipment-travel/vodafone-eurotraveller/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vodafone-eurotraveller.jpg?fit=339%2C263&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="339,263" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Vodafone-EuroTraveller" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vodafone-eurotraveller.jpg?fit=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vodafone-eurotraveller.jpg?fit=339%2C263&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft  wp-image-96992" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vodafone-eurotraveller.jpg?resize=241%2C187&#038;ssl=1" alt="Vodafone-EuroTraveller" width="241" height="187" data-recalc-dims="1" />continue using my phone (calls, texts, data&#8230;) just as I would have done back in the UK. Perfect! (Apart from in Montenegro of course &#8211; more details on <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/2013/07/17/cycling-day-14-ulcinj-to-tivat/" target="_blank">the post I wrote at the time</a>.) I seem to remember that last summer, Vodafone actually reduced this charge to £2 a day in the summer months and I am hoping that they will do the same in 2015. Anyway for most of my trip &#8211; all seven countries are included in Vodafone&#8217;s &#8216;Eurozone&#8217; &#8211; this time I&#8217;ve checked!) &#8211; I am happy to pay the extra £3 (or £2) which will add around £90 to my bill per month between May and July. However (and this is the complicated bit) when I&#8217;m in Spain, there is a cheaper option: buy a local SIM card. I could do this in France, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway but quite frankly I can&#8217;t be bothered will all the hassle of constantly swapping over cards in the phone (and can you imagine looking for a micro SIM card when you drop it at a campsite?!). But in Spain I&#8217;ll be in Cadiz for a month learning some Spanish and then in April travelling north on the bike. For that period it does seem sensible to try and save myself £180 by buying a local SIM. So, I travel to Spain on the 25th February and probably pay £3 for the first couple of days by using the Euro Traveller, I then text REMOVE to 40506 (I&#8217;m writing this here so I can refer back to it later) which will stop me being charged £3 a day. I then buy a local SIM and use it in my iPhone (which belongs to me, not Vodafone so I&#8217;m free to do this). Brilliant! However, how will people from back home contact me? Well, I could tell them the new number (a bit of a faff) or I could put my UK SIM card into a cheap phone that I&#8217;ve bought back in the UK. By stopping the Euro Traveller service I won&#8217;t incur the £3 a day charge should I very occasionally use the phone but I will still have access to any calls or texts that are sent to me. At the end of my period in Spain towards the end of April I text ADD to 40506 and the Euro Traveller service starts again for the remainder of the cycle. Can anyone see a flaw in my cunning plan? If you can, please let me know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, what do I still need to do? Well, I require a new stand for Reggie (I&#8217;m tempted to get hold of one of these, the <a href="http://www.evanscycles.com/products/pletscher/double-leg-center-kickstand-ec009056" target="_blank">Pletscher double leg center kickstand</a>. Anyone used one?) Then I need to start sorting through the packing boxes from the move north to fish out all the bits of kit I will be taking to Spain (or rather than <a href="https://www.luggagemule.co.uk/" target="_blank">Luggage Mule</a> will be picking up on the 23rd). That&#8217;s going to be a long job. Even more pressing than that is a questionnaire for the BBC. I&#8217;m being interviewed on Monday at 2pm on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00t3gy6" target="_blank">Radio Leeds by Martin Kelner</a> and I need to pick some music! It&#8217;s Yorkshire&#8217;s answer to Dessert Island Discs. I thought I&#8217;d put that in at the very end of the post just to see if anyone reads this far &#8211; well done if you did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One very last thing; my sister-in-law has asked me to buy an Acme Thunderer whistle as a present for someone training to be a teacher at her school(!). On your marks, get set&#8230; GO!</p>
