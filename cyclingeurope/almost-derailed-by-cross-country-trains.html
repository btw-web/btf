<h1>Almost Derailed by Cross Country Trains</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people who thinks that the trains in Britain were far better before privatisation &#8211; they certainly were not &#8211; they were much worse; just like TV in the 70s and 80s, the clothes, public services, schools, museums&#8230;. Most things are much better now. But our expectations have risen. So when I try and contact Cross Country Trains by phone because their website does not allow me to reserve a place for my bike at the same time as my seat (which the very same website tells me I must do) and I get transferred to another continent who cut me off after having made me wait while they &#8220;check the back office&#8221;, am I right to be annoyed? Probably. I gave up on Cross Country Trains after having rung back and being told that not one train on either the 1st, 2<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">nd</span> or 3rd August is capable of taking my bike (I just don&#8217;t believe this! All Cross Country trains have bike compartments and as the trains are very short, I cannot imagine that it is impossible to get me and my bike from Reading to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Berwick</span>-upon-Tweed on any of those days&#8230;). Stop! This is becoming a rant. Just one last thing: I now know why they are called Cross Country Trains &#8211; and it has nothing to do with them going diagonally up and down the country.<br />But I have bought a first <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">calss</span> single ticket from Kings Cross to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Berwick</span> leaving at 9.30am on Saturday 1st August with National Express East Coast. First class? That&#8217;s a bit <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">extravagant</span> Andrew! Well, no. The logic of 21st Century train travel in the UK dictates that it was cheaper to do that than buy a standard class single ticket. I shall spend 4 hours in the lap of luxury in my cycling gear in first class. There is one downside to first class on a train: usually, I suppose in the expectation that most people who take bikes on trains don&#8217;t go in first class, the place where you can store them is at the other end of the train&#8230;<br />Just to make me feel better, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7599141.stm">here are some seriously pissed off train users</a> 🙂</p>
