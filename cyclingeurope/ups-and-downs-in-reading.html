<h1>Ups and downs in Reading</h1>
<p>Today has been a funny day. Let&#8217;s start on a good point: my deliveries have started to arrive &#8211; Mark Beaumont&#8217;s book. But then it rained&#8230;and rained&#8230; when will this English summer start? I plodded up to AW Cycles, my bike shop of choice to invest in more kit &#8211; this time the panniers. I went for the 36 litre <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Altura</span> Orkney ones (in red), £89.99. I also bought a &#8220;bar bag&#8221; &#8211; same make &#8211; which will take some getting used to, £49.99. I associate any appendage to the handlebars of a bike with Miss Marple kind of cycling &#8211; wicker basket etc&#8230; My £49.99 bought me something which is more weatherproof than wicker with a tea towel on top (in fact it has a plastic map cover on top!), but it will take some getting used to and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be using it around Reading for the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">time being</span>. I&#8217;m sure I will see its benefits when desperate to take a picture in some isolated northern location in a couple of weeks without getting off my bike to delve into the panniers. I got a 10% discount on all of that for being a member of Reading Cycle Campaign and / or the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">CTC</span>. I also bought some spare inner tubes. It seems to be modern thinking that, quite frankly, when an inner tube costs £4.99 (and I bought three today as they were on offer &#8211; three for the price of two), the average cyclist has better things to do with his or her time than find a bath tub full of water, find some chalk, sandpaper, patch and rubber glue to repair a puncture. My total spend today was £135.96. I got home and fitted the front bar bracket and slotted the panniers onto the rack only to find that one of the clips was missing so I cycled back to AW Cycles. They put another one on without quibbling. Chatted with a guy called Gavin who has served me up there on my three visits this week. I asked him what else I needed in terms of repair material / equipment / tools. He recommended a chain splitter / fixer. About £20 should buy me the tool that can do all of that. I&#8217;ll pop in again next week.<br />Cycling back up to AW Cycles this afternoon was the first time I had been on the bike since last weekend: I have been purposefully not using the bike to give my body a rest after the daily commute to and from Henley. I felt nervous about cycling and didn&#8217;t feel at all at ease on the roads. How bizarre. I&#8217;m usually far too comfortable on the roads&#8230;</p>
