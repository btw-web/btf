<h1>The Exclusively Cycling News</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This blog has become a little more generalist of late with me discussing a varied range of topics from trips to France with groups of school children to how the re-decoration of my flat over the last couple of weeks has been progressing. I need to get things back to cycling (although in fairness, my going &#8216;off topic&#8217; doesn&#8217;t seem to have done any harm whatsoever to my cycling blog ranking; up to number 11 in the UK in August compared to number 16 in July!). So here goes. Guaranteed, exclusively cycling content coming up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/416178354_370-jpg.gif"><img data-attachment-id="4416" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2011/08/06/the-exclusively-cycling-news/416178354_370-jpg/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/416178354_370-jpg.gif?fit=370%2C484&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="370,484" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="416178354_370.jpg" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/416178354_370-jpg.gif?fit=229%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/416178354_370-jpg.gif?fit=370%2C484&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4416" title="416178354_370.jpg" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/416178354_370-jpg.gif?resize=206%2C270" alt="" width="206" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A couple of purchases first of all to push me back into cycling thinking; the August copy of <a href="http://magazine.bikeradar.com/category/cycling-plus/" target="_blank">Cycling Plus</a> which I never quite manage to read from cover to cover on the occasions that I buy it but I will try my best over the next couple of weeks. I notice that at the bottom of the front page under the &#8216;<em>Essential Riding Advice</em>&#8216; banner it promises an article entitled &#8216;<em>Drink Booze, Ride Better</em>&#8216;. I wonder if they have lifted one of the <a href="http://apsykes.com/2011-2/" target="_blank">online chapters</a> to my forthcoming book where I managed to cycle along the Eurovelo 5 with far too regular pauses for beer and wine. Incidentally, I am still at the editing stage; I haven&#8217;t touched the original manuscript for about two weeks but I aim to have this done over the course of the coming week. Still not convinced by the title (see the top of the column to your left). <a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/stewart_lemons.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4417" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2011/08/06/the-exclusively-cycling-news/stewart_lemons/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/stewart_lemons.jpg?fit=309%2C475&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="309,475" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="stewart_lemons" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/stewart_lemons.jpg?fit=195%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/stewart_lemons.jpg?fit=309%2C475&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4417" title="stewart_lemons" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/stewart_lemons.jpg?resize=156%2C240" alt="" width="156" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Rick Stein interviewed Chris Stewart, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0953522709" target="_blank"><em>Driving Over Lemons</em></a>, an account of his life in Andalucia, during his trip around Spain this week on the TV (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0134pn9/Rick_Steins_Spain_Episode_4/" target="_blank">well worth a watch</a>) and Chris said that by far the most important thing in selling a book is the title and the cover because although we all like to think that we don&#8217;t, we really do judge a book by its cover. His title is fantastic and immediately conjures up a hot corner of Europe. As it stands, mine says nothing about the contents of the book although at least the cover speaks volumes.</p>

After his previous book called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0552158445/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=103612307&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0593066987&amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_r=0PF07WRSAMRDKVJWW1C9" target="_blank"><em>The Man Who Cycled The World</em></a>, he really could go on for a long time writing books about &#8216;the man who cycled&#8230;&#8217;. That said, <a href="http://www.markbeaumontonline.com/" target="_blank">his current expedition is rowing in the Canadian Arctic</a> so I suppose his next volume would have to be <em>The Man Who Rowed The Canadian Arctic</em>. Anyway, back to his previous cycling trip; the Americas book details his cycling journey from Alaska to the southern tip of Argentina taking in North &amp; South America&#8217;s highest peaks en route; Mounts McKinley &amp; Aconcagua which happen to be at each end of the respective continents. I shall no doubt blog some comments as I read over the next few weeks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My own past and future adventures harvested a few interesting contacts in the past week or so. I have already mentioned Kate Belcheva in a previous post. She is planning on cycling from her home in Bulgaria to London in time for the Olympics next summer and will use the Eurovelo 5 from Switzerland north. <a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/jonathan_37_heading_down_to_altstaetten.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4419" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2011/08/06/the-exclusively-cycling-news/jonathan_37_heading_down_to_altstaetten/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/jonathan_37_heading_down_to_altstaetten.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,333" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="jonathan_37_heading_down_to_Altstaetten" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/jonathan_37_heading_down_to_altstaetten.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/jonathan_37_heading_down_to_altstaetten.jpg?fit=500%2C333&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4419" title="jonathan_37_heading_down_to_Altstaetten" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/jonathan_37_heading_down_to_altstaetten.jpg?resize=180%2C119" alt="" width="180" height="119" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Someone else who is &#8216;<em>musing about something similar</em>&#8216; in his words is <a href="http://twitter.com/?lang=en&amp;logged_out=1#%21/TheJT" target="_blank">@TheJT</a> on Twitter (no name). He describes himself as a &#8216;<em>City-hopping wordsmith; pen for hire and brain to let</em>&#8216; but more than just that, is an ex-pupil of the school where I teach &#8211; <a href="http://www.gillotts.oxon.sch.uk/scripts/index.pl" target="_blank">Gillotts</a> in Henley-on-Thames. From his picture, I suspect his attendance at the place was well before my time but it is good to know that I am enthusing students of Gillotts School,  albeit ones of long ago, to do something cycling wise. I&#8217;ve asked for more details of what his musings might lead him to do, whether it be the Eurovelo 5 or some other cycling adventure and I&#8217;ll let you know when he reports back.  And the future? Well, that is hopefully going to be the Eurovelo 8 in 2013, but Rachel Golden from the USA will have beaten me to it. She commented the following; &#8216;<em>I’m hoping to bike-camp the Eurovelo8 route in 2012. I have 4 months off work. When do you recommend is best? April-July? I’m an avid bike-tourer, but have never done it outside of the U.S. Any advice would be great!</em>&#8216;. I advised April &#8211; June to avoid the heat of the summer and the crowds but I think by the time she has completed the route next year, the advice will be coming in the opposite direction. She has subscribed to the blog (you can too &#8211; just click here) so may become a familiar name that you recognise on here over the months to come. I hope so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And finally (as they say in all the best news bulletins), the Trek was indeed sold. For £100 he was pedaled down the road next to the flats where I live rather unsteadily by his new owner earlier this week. I wish both of them happy cycling. Reggie now has the hall to himself!</p>
