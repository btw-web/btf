<h1>Is The &#8216;Golden Age For Cycling&#8217; Already Over?</h1>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">As I have been doing ever since the lockdown started, today I went out for my daily exercise. It&#8217;s no longer my &#8216;permitted&#8217; exercise as it seems that things are back to normal in terms of getting out and about, as long as we keep our 2 metres of distance. In the main, people seem to be sticking to that. This morning I set off on what would become a 20km walk to the Ryburn and Baitings reservoirs making the most of the warm day. There were a good number of people out and about despite it being Monday; I was certainly not alone.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Then I looked online at social media and the news. Today saw the &#8216;non-essential&#8217; shops reopen and the long lines of people queuing was a depressing sight. Tonight on the news a woman explained that she had taken a day off work to ensure that she could visit her local Primark. I was immediately reminded of this wonderful cartoon by <a href="https://www.robertthompsoncartoons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Thompson</a> that appears in the current edition of Private Eye:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">First of all can I say that I understand that the economy needs to get going again and an important part of that is the shops reopening, especially in Britain where so much of the economy is service-based. I have no truck with that (although taking a day off work to head off to queue at Primark seems a little excessive&#8230;). But it is worrying how quickly some people seem to be reverting back to their old ways. Remember a few weeks ago when Boris Johnson stood up in parliament and talked about a &#8216;<em>golden age for cycling</em>&#8216;? All the talk of creating safe space for walking and cycling that would transform the way we live our lives? A real silver lining to the black cloud that has been the Coronavirus.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Yesterday I spent about two hours highlighting potential changes that would help develop better safe spaces for walking and cycling in my local area of Calderdale via <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.yourvoice.westyorks-ca.gov.uk/safestreets" target="_blank">a portal that has been created by the West Yorkshire Combined Authority</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;The West Yorkshire Combined Authority and our partners want to understand which areas in our region could be improved to help the public travel more easily by bike or on foot, and to provide more space to travel safely while social distancing. Our interactive map will allow you to highlight issues that you are experiencing when travelling by bike or on foot and to suggest where improvements could be made to make these journeys safer, including increasing space for social distancing.&#8221;</em></p><cite><a href="https://www.yourvoice.westyorks-ca.gov.uk/safestreets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WYCA: Safe Streets for Walking and Cycling</a></cite></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The map itself can be found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.yourvoice.westyorks-ca.gov.uk/safestreets/maps/safestreets" target="_blank">here</a> and, should you live or work in the Calderdale, Kirklees or Wakefield areas, I would encourage you to add your thoughts. Here&#8217;s one of the entries &#8211; one of the longer ones &#8211; that I added concerning the A640 New Hey Road that connects Outlane / Junction 23 of the M62 with the centre of Huddersfield:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;The entire length of New Hey Road is very dangerous for cycling. This is despite it being a very wide road and already having a cycle lane marked on the road for much on the length of the road. Alas cars park intermittently along the entire length of the cycle lane rendering much of it less than useless. Cyclists have to constantly enter the lane of traffic. It is safer simply to ignore the cycle lane and remain in the traffic. The risk of being &#8216;doored&#8217; is high as the cycle lane runs adjacent to car parking for many stretches of the road. The cycle lane / road itself is very poorly maintained. Pinch points (bollards, crossing etc&#8230;) are regular features of the road. With quality design and significant investment this road could be a fantastic example of how different methods of transport can coexist. There is plenty of space but so much is wasted with hatched off areas in the centre of the road. A large number of people live on either side of the road, there is a large secondary school on the road and others very close by. If we are not willing to invest to create quality safe space for walking and cycling on this road, then tinkering around the edges elsewhere is simply a bit of window dressing.&#8221;</em></p><cite><a href="https://www.yourvoice.westyorks-ca.gov.uk/safestreets/maps/safestreets#marker-9209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew P.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">A couple of weeks ago &#8211; during the lockdown &#8211; this was the attitude of one van driver to creating safe space for cycling. He parked his vehicle in the cycle lane as I was approaching him IN THE CYCLE LANE and when I asked if he could move it and explained why it wasn&#8217;t really on for him to do what he had just done, he told me that he needed someone in the shade to eat his lunch. It was almost comical:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background has-medium-font-size">Am I just wasting my time? Are we all wasting our time filling in forms and online consultations when the willingness for the wider population is not to embrace anything new but to revert back to their old ways as soon as they possibly can? We&#8217;ve already seen the number of cars on the road seemingly return back to normal levels. The people are eager to get back to Primark and I don&#8217;t have an issue with that but in other areas &#8211; safe space for walking and cycling &#8211; I am worried&#8230;</p>
