<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify has-very-light-gray-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">The 2020 Tour de France is scheduled to take place a little later this year, with 29<sup>th</sup> August pencilled in for the opening day of the Grand Tour. This year’s Tour is expected to be wide open, with a large pool of cyclists likely to be hopeful of coming out on top after 21 gruelling stages. Here is a look at who we think are the four biggest contenders for the latest renewal of the most famous cycling event in the world.</p>



<h3><strong>Ergan Bernal</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="youtube-player" width="890" height="501" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lTOyQTpISSg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-GB&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Colombian rider Ergan Bernal won the Tour de France for the first time in his career in 2019 and he is <a href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/Cycling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the favourite in the cycling betting at 7/2</a> to prevail once again this year.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The 23-year-old has gone from strength to strength since joining Team Inseos (formerly Team Sky) in 2018. He was also successful in Paris-Nice and Tour de Suisse last year which proves his victory in the Tour de France was no fluke.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Bernal has been tipped to have multiple success in the Grand Tour competitions over the next few years. Now he knows what it takes to be top of the podium in Paris, he will fancy his chances of defending his crown and becoming the first back-to-back winner since 2017.</p>



<h3><strong>Chris Froome</strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Chris Froome was forced to miss the Tour de France in 2019 following <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2840707-chris-froome-injured-out-of-2019-tour-de-france-after-very-serious-accident" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a high-speed crash on his bike last June</a>. The four-time Tour winner is now back cycling and will be hoping to add to his tally in the race in September.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Froome’s record in the Tour de France speaks for itself. He will be one of the most experienced cyclists taking part in 2020. Although the focus within Team Ineos is no longer just on Froome, he still has&nbsp;a strong team around him which gives him a great chance once again. &nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Primoz Roglic</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe loading="lazy" class="youtube-player" width="890" height="501" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kGSB_YsC4f0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-GB&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Primoz Roglic won the biggest race of&nbsp;his career in 2019 with his success in the Vuelta a Espana. It was the first time the Slovenian had entered the event and it proved to be a winning debut.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Roglic has featured twice in the Tour de France. He was a long way down the field in 38<sup>th</sup> place on his first appearance in 2018. The 30-year-old fared much better 12 months later though, finishing fourth in the race, which was won by Bernal.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">With more experience in the Grand Tour events now, Roglic goes into the 2020 Tour de France as one of the most consistent cyclists in the sport so must be considered as a strong contender.</p>



<h3><strong>Geraint Thomas</strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Great Britain’s Geraint Thomas has not been out of the first two in the last couple of Tour de France classifications. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/07/30/633863542/welsh-cyclist-geraint-thomas-wins-tour-de-france?t=1588609534820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">He was crowned the winner in 2018</a> while in 2019 he finished second in another excellent campaign.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Thomas is part of the strong Team Ineos squad, which has everything in its ranks to produce the winner once again in 2020.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This year’s Tour will the 107<sup>th</sup> edition and will begin with stage one in Nice. As ever, it will conclude in Paris along the Champs Elysees.</p>
