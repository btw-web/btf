<h1>Yorkshire To Edinburgh By Bicycle</h1>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">The cycle touring summer of 2020 has been somewhat delayed by the outbreak of COVID-19 and the lockdown restrictions that were implemented in March. However, to a greater extent, limitations on travel have now been lifted and it seems an appropriate time to head off on the bike. If you read <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2020/07/09/summer-2020-plan-b/" target="_blank">the post from a couple of days ago</a></span> (which has since been updated several times), you will know that my plan is to head north from where I live in Pennine West Yorkshire (A on the Google Map at the foot of this post) in the direction of&#8230; Edinburgh (H).</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">One slight difference with this cycle tour is that a bit more pre-planning has been required. This summer it is simply not possible to arrive at a campsite and expect to be able to stay overnight with a bike and a small tent as COVID-19 regulations have put strict limits on the number of people on site so, for the first time in my cycle touring career, I have pre-booked accommodation in advance and this is where I will be staying and what I will be doing over the course of the next few days:</p>



<p><strong>Tuesday 14th July</strong>:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.catgillfarm.co.uk/" target="_blank">Catgill Farm Campsite</a>&nbsp;(B) near Bolton Abbey</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The cycle to Bolton Abbey is a familiar one and there are several possible routes. As I know the area well I will follow my nose. The key challenge will be keeping away from the busy A629 road along the Aire Valley north of Keighley.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I&#8217;m meeting the cycle writer Rob Ainsley at the campsite and my plan is to record the next episode of <strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/podcast/" target="_blank">The Cycling Europe Podcast</a></em></strong> with his help. It&#8217;s going to be themed on interesting premises for cycle tours and having completed multiple interesting rides himself, I&#8217;m looking forward to recording the chat. The podcast will also feature two cyclists who each had a rather unique idea for a cycle tour. (Their contributions were recorded last week.) The podcast will be out as soon as possible after I return to Yorkshire but that could be several weeks away.</p>



<p><strong>Wednesday 15th July</strong>:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.oldhallcottagecampsite.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Old Hall Cottage Campsite</a>&nbsp;(C) near Hawes</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Following <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cyclethedales.org.uk/route/yorkshire_dales_cycleway/" target="_blank">the Yorkshire Dales Cycleway</a> should help me get to Hawes. That said, I will probably follow Wensleydale upon arrival in Wensley itself thus avoiding some big hills.</p>



<p><strong>Thursday 16th / Friday 17th / Saturday 18th July</strong>:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rydalhall.org/" target="_blank">Rydal Hall Campsite</a>&nbsp;(D) near Ambleside</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It proved very difficult to find any camping accommodation to continue my journey north on Saturday 18th so I contacted Rydal Hall and reserved a third consecutive night. This means that I can spend two days cycling in the Lake District, not just the one. With the panniers stored in the tent, it also means I don&#8217;t need to be wary of the hills.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">On Thursday I need to head west from Hawes. National Cycle Routes 10, 68 and 70 will probably feature. I need to look into these a little bit more. Any advice?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">On Friday morning I am meeting a chap called Tim Boden (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2020/07/09/summer-2020-plan-b/" target="_blank">who was mentioned in the earlier post</a>) and he will hopefully join me for a cycle from Ambleside along the Langdale Valley. Later in the day I intend to cycle alongside Coniston Water and Windermere in a loop that will see me back in Ambleside by the end of the day.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As for Saturday &#8211; my extra day in the Lakes! &#8211; I have, as yet, no ideas whatsoever. Perhaps Tim will be able to advise me. Or perhaps you can?</p>



<p><strong>Sunday 19th</strong>:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.c2c-cycle-accommodation.co.uk/" target="_blank">Bank House Farm</a>&nbsp;(E) near Penrith</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Tim can probably also advise about a route in the direction of Penrith. A direct route beside Ullswater or a longer journey via Thirlmere?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UPDATE</span></strong>: Jeff &#8211; who lives in Cumbria &#8211; has been in touch with the following advice regarding the route from Rydal Hall to Penrith:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;I have a few suggestions about your route from Rydal to Bank House. You could go up Kirkstone Pass, but the road isn&#8217;t called &#8216;The Struggle&#8217; for nothing! I would recommend looking for the small lanes that come out of the top side of Grasmere, eventually forcing you on to the main Ambleside -Keswick road. At the top of Dunmail Raise there&#8217;s a lovely cycle path on the left. This takes you on to the quiet side of Thirlmere. From there, cross the main road, go up St John&#8217;s in the Vale, to Threlkeld, where you can pick up the C2C and then follow this all the way to Little Salkeld and your campsite.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Monday 20th July</strong>: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.winshieldscampsite.co.uk/" target="_blank">Winshields Campsite</a> (F) near Haltwhistle</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Monday will see me climb Hartside Top. (Have they rebuilt the café yet since it burnt to the ground?) I climbed the hill from the other direction <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/countries/united-kingdom/index-of-posts/" target="_blank">back in 2009 when I cycled along Route 68, the Pennine Cycleway</a> so it will be interesting to do it in reverse. The campsite near Haltwhistle is very close to Hadrian&#8217;s Wall so that should offer some diversions when off the bike.</p>



<p><strong>Tuesday 21st July</strong>: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ruberslaw.co.uk/" target="_blank">Ruberslaw Wild Woods Camping</a> (G) near Hawick</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I would have loved to stay overnight at the campsite at the northern end of Kielder Water but alas there is no availability for the night of July 21st. I will, however, do the next best thing and cycle beside the lake before pushing on in the direction of the Scottish border and the campsite near Hawick.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Wednesday 22nd July</strong>: Edinburgh (H). I haven&#8217;t arranged any accommodation in Edinburgh. Perhaps it might be a good time to revisit <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.warmshowers.org/search" target="_blank">WarmShowers</a>. It is a city that is not lacking in potential hosts and after over a week in the tent I may be grateful for a mattress&#8230; If you live in Edinburgh, are on WarmShowers and happen to be reading this, please get in touch.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">For someone so accustomed to making things up on a day-to-day basis, I&#8217;m quite looking forward to having sorted out the accommodation for the first week of this trip in advance. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>After Edinburgh? Who knows&#8230;? Any advice about the journey to the Scottish capital or where I should go afterwards is very welcome:</strong></p>
