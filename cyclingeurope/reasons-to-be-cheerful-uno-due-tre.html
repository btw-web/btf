<h1>Reasons To Be Cheerful, Uno, Due, Tre&#8230;</h1>
<p>1. I have a place to sleep tonight in a very busy but very friendly site somewhere that I can&#8217;t spell without looking at the map (and that would mean standing up and I can&#8217;t be bothered) but about 30 kilometres south of Parma<br />
2. I have just eaten a fantastic gourmet mean while sat on the ground next to my tent of a baguette, some Philadelphia full fat (never buy that I&#8217;m the UK!) cheese, a tube of Pringles and a packet of biscuits. If anyone feels more satisfied than I do within 100 kms of here after eating tonight, I&#8217;d be very surprised indeed.<br />
3. It was all washed down with the contents of a bottle of Montepuliciano wine drunk from a bright yellow University of York (Wentworth College) mug. Best of all it isn&#8217;t finished yet!<br />
4. I am on the cusp of cycling 2,000 kilometres since leaving my flat in Reading three weeks ago today. I&#8217;m very proud of that. My Italian neighbours on the campsite were very impressed when they asked me. (They will never find out that Reading isn&#8217;t actually in the Shetland Iles&#8230;)<br />
5. I have had lots of conversations in Italian today and even been complimented by one chap in the local town with the very long name (see the excuse in number 1 for not telling you what it is) for how good it was; he even put his arm round me while telling me how to get to the campsite!<br />
6. I have just spent an excellent 36 hours in the company of a young couple from Pavia who couldn&#8217;t have been kinder and more generous in welcoming me onto their house and easing me into Italian life and culture; thank-you Simone and Elettra.<br />
7. Two friends &#8211; Sally in the UK &amp; Simone in Italy &#8211; have gone to the effort of finding out the names and addresses of two cycling shops in the local town with a very long name (see 1) for which, even if both shops are shut, I will be eternally grateful as it means that I will sleep better tonight (needless to say with the help of the Montepulciano).<br />
8. When I lay back and look at the sky, I do not see a cloud, just the emerging stars. They are just a bit more blurred after each sip.<br />
9. I have so much to look forward to over the next two weeks including meeting up with people I have never met in Rome and in Benevento who I am sure will be just as friendly and welcoming as Simone and Elettra were in Pavia.<br />
10. I have, in Puglia, two good friends and two familiar faces to look forward to seeing and spending a few days with at the end of my trip. Reasons to be miserable:<br />
1. One of my spokes is broken and I cycled a bloody long way to find a campsite (OK pedants out there, that&#8217;s two reasons but it doesn&#8217;t fit with the thrust of this post!) but&#8230;. (reason to see the silver lining around the cloud), I have experienced some of the most beautiful scenery of my trip so far while cycling those last few kilometres.<br />
Result: 10-1. The reasons to be cheerful have won the Community Shield of Eurovelo 5 hands down.</p>
