<h1>Cycling Day 6: Nafpaktos to Mitikas</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m in Mitikas. Didn&#8217;t arrive until about 8pm but more of that in a moment. I eventually dragged myself away from the café in Nafpaktos and headed back in the direction of the bridge. It&#8217;s a very photogenic thing and I spent a bit if time snapping photos from various angles. What is it with bridges that makes them so pleasing on the eye? Even the most brutal of bridges (I&#8217;m trying to think of a good example) is worth a photo so when you get one where more than just a little time and thought has gone into how it looks, it&#8217;s photo heaven. Can&#8217;t think of a brutal bridge. Perhaps you can suggest one.<br />
My Michelin map shows a motorway running all the way from the bridge to somewhere above the fold (the map is still in the plastic protective thing and sorry, I can&#8217;t be bothered to rip open the Velcro &#8211; there is a lot of it &#8211; and find out where it goes) so I was expecting the A road that runs adjacent to the motorway to be relatively quiet. Problem was that until half way along my route the motorway hasn&#8217;t yet been built. The dotted red and yellow bands that indicate a motorway under construction had escaped me and I only really noticed it when I couldn&#8217;t see or hear a motorway where it should be. The result was that the traffic on the road that I was taking was much, much heavier than I had anticipated. The road was also thinner than the roads had been in the Peloponnese and I felt increasingly intimidated by the speeding cars, lorries and coaches that thundered past me at speed. The road safety minister in the Greek government must have a thankless task. The driving habits of all but a small minority of drivers are appalling; mobiles used while driving, speeding (one motorist drove past me today doing at least 80km/hr in a 30km/hr zone), overtaking habits, tailgating&#8230; I could go on (and probably will in the book citing statistics when I find them) of how bad the driving is here in Greece. On reflection I&#8217;d be surprised if Greece has a road safety minister in the government.<br />
A few interesting encounters today. I cycled alongside an archaeological dig taking place at a 2nd century BC theatre at a place called Kalydon. I chatted to one of the archeologists for a few minutes; it was the final summer of work and they were concentrating upon the stage area. I later bumped into a couple of French people &#8211; Isabelle &amp; Samuel &#8211; who were making a television documentary about a caravan being towed to Olympia. I&#8217;m not sure why it was being towed to Olympia but they passed on details of the Facebook page and I will investigate later. I also made the acquaintance of a herd if cattle and a number if goats. Now this may sound stupid but I noticed today how much goats smell like goats&#8217; cheese. Obviously it&#8217;s the cheese smelling of the goats but this does make me reassess my love of goats&#8217; cheese.<br />
Most the the goats were on the final section of today&#8217;s ride from Etoliko (missed tourism opportunity if ever there was one &#8211; just Google the location and you&#8217;ll see what I mean) and my final destination here in Mitikas.<br />
Other things to remember to include in the book; the salt flats, the deserted roads, towns &amp; everything else after Mesolongi. Mesolongi itself; what a cycling-friendly place it is (in contrast to Nafpaktos which has invested in the infrastructure but nobody seems to cycle; in Mesolongi people cycle in number but cycling infrastructure is non-existant; debate!). The stunning views in the final section of the route along the coast in the 30km before Mitikas.<br />
And so to Mitikas itself. The French TV couple had said there were plenty of campsites. I have found one and it is run by a man who you would not want within 100 metres of your children. My neighbours on the site are a couple of teenage girls who see drama in everyone (OK, that&#8217;s teenage girls&#8230;). The chap who lent me the mallet to help erect the tent did speak excellent English and hopefully is looking out for my tent while I&#8217;m sitting here typing this next to the sea but if I had been looking for a contrast to last night&#8217;s boutique hotel in Nafpaktos, I think I&#8217;ve found it at Camping Ionia in Mitikas. </p>
