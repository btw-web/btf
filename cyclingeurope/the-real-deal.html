<h1>The Real Deal</h1>
<p>Iain Harper and I exchanged messages as I was sitting in the precincts of Canterbury Cathedral and arranged to meet. We had coffee and he persuaded me that a comfortable bed in his house was a better option than scamp-site and I eventually agreed (I am worried about getting out of the camping habit after just one night under, well it isn&#8217;t canvas anymore but some lightweight material designed by NASA no doubt).<br />
The cycle across the beautiful Kent countryside towards Deal where Iain lives with his partner Carly was stunning in the early evening setting sun and if I needed evidence to prove that this county really is the garden of England, I couldn&#8217;t have done better. I was, however beginning to tire and it was a relief, after 127 kms (from Abbey Wood that is, not Canterbury) to arrive at Iain&#8217;s house. Following a quick shower the three of us drove to the seafront in the town and ate. I could have eaten my lasagne three times over; the hunger has begun to kick in big time despite the extraordinary number of calories I must be consuming.<br />
Iain &amp; Carly were the perfect hosts; after eating we walked along the pier at dusk and then drove to Sandwich for another stroll and a quick drink. They were both interesting as people and interested in my little adventure. As a yoga teacher I pointed Carly in the direction of <a href="http://www.euronaissance.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.euronaissance.com</a> , my destination in Puglia.<br />
And so to Tuesday, my first border crossing and a bit of a rest day as U only have to cycle down the coast to Dover, jump on a ferry, meet up with Alain in Boulogne and cycle to his place. Iain gave my bike a quick once over and then I was off. To say that I had only met them barely 12 hours ago, I was as comfortable with them as I am with some people I have known for 12 years&#8230;. This Internet networking thing seems to work!<br />
PS: If you are looking for a nice place to visit, you could do a lot worse than Deal. The first town to be recommended by eurovelo5.com 🙂</p>
