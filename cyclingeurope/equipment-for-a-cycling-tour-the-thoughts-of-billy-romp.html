I much prefer a light kit on a heavy bicycle with fat, smooth tires. My 2012 trip was 10 months, 14,000 miles, in weather that included freezing temperatures, snow, rain, desert dry heat, and tropical heat with humidity. I camped about half the time. <a href="http://billyromp.com/" target="_blank">billyromp.com</a> contains a list of my equipment. After forty years of bicycle touring I feel I have a highly developed kit.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>1) Ortlieb panniers, not light, but recommended <span style="color:#ff0000;">Agree</span></em><br />
<em> 2) I choose to ride without a helmet; I use a wool cycling cap in cold weather, a cotton one in warm. <span style="color:#ff0000;">For my daily commute I wear mine all the time but yes, for touring you need to have a more pragmatic approach depending upon the conditions you are cycling in.</span></em><br />
<em> 3) A plastic plate is very light but unreliable and single-purpose. I use a titanium Sierra cup, no heavier, more versatile. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Not sure why a plastic plate should be unreliable&#8230; or less versatile.</span></em><br />
<em> 4) I use a four-season mountaineering tent, single-wall, 1-2 man, Black Diamond brand, 3.5 pounds. More than 4 pounds is excessive. <span style="color:#ff0000;">The Robens Osprey 2 &#8211; the tent I&#8217;m taking &#8211; weighs in at 2.4kg or 5.3lbs. Excessive? I need more space than I was afforded by the Helium 100 back in 2010 so I&#8217;m happy with the Osprey.</span></em><br />
<em> 5) A two-pound goose down bag (North Face Chrysalis) serves me well; it packs up very small. A goose-down hooded jacket, pants and booties, ultralight, from Western Mountaineering, extends the bag’s usefulness in cold weather. Rule of thumb: if I am not wearing everything to bed on the coldest night of the trip, I have carried too much clothing. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Nice logic. My sleeping bag is down but I don&#8217;t think that during the summer cycling along the Mediterranean coast I&#8217;ll be too worried about the cold. </span></em><br />
<em> 5b) Vango brand I am unfamiliar with. I see most bicyclists carrying way too much mattress. An ultra-light Thermarest has served me well for decades; it rolls down to the size of a water bottle and weighs a few ounces. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Again, my own experiences from 2010 tell me that ultra-thin is equivalent to ultra-uncomfortable. I&#8217;m happy with a standard mat which rolls up slightly larger than a water bottle.</span></em><br />
<em> 6) I make up my own first aid kit, according to my planned exposure and my own first aid skills. Wound care, basically. <span style="color:#ff0000;">It would probably have cost me about the same (if not more) to buy the items in the first aid kit individually.</span></em><br />
<em> 7) I use a wash cloth; a towel is a luxury. <span style="color:#ff0000;">It&#8217;s a travel towel so very small. Towels can be comforting; you can hug them&#8230;</span></em><br />
<em> 8) A single keychain LED light is enough. A spare one is in the survival kit. <span style="color:#ff0000;">The LED one I&#8217;m taking is very small. </span></em><br />
<em> 9) A camping stool? Unless you have a physical limitation, a heavy luxury. <span style="color:#ff0000;">It&#8217;s extremely light and it is certainly one thing that I missed when cycling to Italy in 2010. That said, it is likely to be an item that I abandon if it becomes a pain to carry it. It only cost me £6.</span></em><br />
<em> 10) I wear mountain bike racing shoes, SPD. “Touring shoes” and sandals break down quickly by comparison. <span style="color:#ff0000;">The sandals are wonderfully comfortable and allow the feet to breath in the hot weather. </span></em><br />
<em> 11) I read books on my iPhone these days. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Delighted to hear that! (Have you bought <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Crossing-Europe-Called-Reggie-ebook/dp/B009YYZLDY/" target="_blank">mine</a> yet?) I&#8217;m clearly a big fan of eBooks but I&#8217;m also a professional browser who likes nothing more to sit with a beer and choose random pages of a guidebook to read. Yes, I could do that with the iPhone or iPad but at least real books don&#8217;t need charging&#8230;</span></em><br />
<em> 12) Business cards are a good investment and worth carrying. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Agree! (especially when you are flogging a book&#8230;)</span></em><br />
<em> 13) Finish Line Dry has limited application, no rain protection. I’m not particular, but it has to be heavier than that. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Again, the conditions should be dry along the Med but if needed I can always exchange for heavier duty oil.</span></em><br />
<em> 14) Multi-function tools vary a lot, and most are overly heavy. I carry a tiny pocket Swiss Army knife to supplement the Opinel knife in the cook kit. <span style="color:#ff0000;">I need to take some basic tools hopefully for nothing more than reassembling the bike when I arrive at Athens airport.</span></em><br />
<em> 15) Rechargeable and battery front lights are heavy for their output and unreliable compared to a generator with a powerful light. I prefer battery-powered rear lights; they are more reliable than a long wire from the front to the back. Spare batteries are not needed; I carry a spare rear light, a tiny button-battery unit, the size of a wrist watch that mounts on the seat post or anywhere. <span style="color:#ff0000;">I don&#8217;t intend cycling at night but it may happen (and there are tunnels of course if I&#8217;m allowed to cycle through them) so hopefully recharging the front light shouldn&#8217;t be too much of an issue. It charges by plugging into a computer via the USB port so when I arrive at a friendly campsite reception&#8230;</span></em><br />
<em> 16) I am not a photography enthusiast, so I save weight by bringing no camera, case, tripod, batteries, recharger. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Essential for me. I missed having a quality camera in 2010 as there are things that an iPhone simply won&#8217;t do. In the book I&#8217;d like to publish more photographs but they do need to be good ones!</span></em><br />
<em> 17) I’m a believer in good solid water bottles.</em><br />
<em> 18) I do not use a lock. While occasionally one would be convenient, it is hardly necessary. In the most dangerous campsites I tie a black cord to the bike, lead it into the tent and tie it to my sleeping bag. At hotels, hostels and at hosts’ homes I bring the bike inside, try hard to bring it to my room, and trust the front desk when I can not. So far so good. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Agree mostly with this. The cable lock is used for the purpose you state here to attach the bike to the tent (although I suppose I might be better buying a thinner steel cord). My bike is however insured and to not lock it would invalidate the insurance so this one is not optional I&#8217;m afraid.</span></em><br />
<em> 19) There are lighter pumps, good ones. Mine is Topeak brand, tiny, only a few ounces. <span style="color:#ff0000;">It was the smallest one in the shop!</span></em><br />
<em> 20) Three water bottle cages are sometimes not enough for water. I would not use one for tools. <span style="color:#ff0000;">I&#8217;ll take a flexible approach to this. If I need a third cage, I&#8217;ll use it for water instead of carrying tools. That said, I am cycling through some very hot places and I will probably be carrying extra water in the panniers anyway.</span></em><br />
<em> 21) I go a little heavy on tools. A needle-nosed Vise-Grip is good. So is a toothbrush. I like to have a couple of cone wrenches and some BB tools. I carry two tubes and a patch kit (with a razor blade, wire, and money in it). I did not notice a patch kit on your list. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Well-spotted! There is no patch kit as I&#8217;ll just replace the inner tube if they go with a new one and stock up on spare inner tubes as I cycle. In 2010 I didn&#8217;t have a single puncture. I&#8217;m  hoping for a similar experience in 2013! I may live to regret this strategy&#8230;</span></em><br />
<em> 22) Soap powder; for laundry? Available where laundry machines are; not recommended for rivers and streams. <span style="color:#ff0000;">My experience tells me otherwise. Very often campsites use the necessity for washing powder as a reason to fleece their customers. A few solid-state washing powder tablets are useful.</span></em><br />
<em> 23) Wallet, of course, for the contents. A zip-lock bag suffices.</em><br />
<em> 24) Better make that two spare cables, one brake and one derailleur. Spare spokes definitely; I put mine in the seat post with a cork. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Thanks for pointing this out.</span></em><br />
<em> 25) Toothpaste I like. Deodorant creates a situation where eventually you will smell worse as the bacteria change to deodorant-resistant. Wear wool, which has natural antibacterial properties and fights odour. In warm weather I wash (rinse) clothing and body daily. <span style="color:#ff0000;">The deodorant is not for smelling sweet while I cycle but for the occasions when I have other things to do. I am writing a book about the trip and will be spending much time in other people&#8217;s company, some planned meetings, other impromptu ones. They will not all be cyclists and if we head off to share a meal in a restaurant for example, I&#8217;d rather not wreak of perspiration.</span></em><br />
<em> 26) Shaving gel–in a can? Heavy. Bar soap (which I have anyway) and a brush (super-light weight) do the trick. <span style="color:#ff0000;">I like my smoothly shaved chin 🙂 Surely the small can I have cannot be much bigger than a brush.</span></em><br />
<em> 27) Another lock? <span style="color:#ff0000;">See above. Padlocks (if you are referring to those) are useful on any trip whether on or off a bike.</span></em><br />
<em> 28) Mouthwash–like deodorant–you’re better off without it. Good brushing, the occasional mint or chewing gum. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Mouthwash changed my oral hygiene a few years ago when I started using it. I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s coming with me! Gum? Not a fan and environmentally unfriendly&#8230;</span></em><br />
<em> 29) I have stopped using maps since I carry an iPhone. When I did use maps, I kept them in the pack and referred to them only when necessary, usually in town. I find a mounted map distracting. Same for iPhone: I carry it in the handlebar bag, not on a mount, and refer to it as necessary. <span style="color:#ff0000;">I&#8217;ll be using both electronic and traditional maps. I am a sucker for a map and could (and no doubt will) spend hours poring over them. Digital maps are great but I like to look beyond the edges of the screen to where I&#8217;m not going as well as those places that I will visit. In addition, maps are excellent conversation ignitors in a way that screens on iPhones or iPads are not. </span></em><br />
<em> 30) Waterproof bags, good. Bungee cords, bad. They are poor attachment devices on a bicycle, and can be dangerous. Perlon cord will serve you much better. <span style="color:#ff0000;">You may have a point about the bungees. I&#8217;ll think about this one carefully.</span></em><br />
<em> 31) You carry an iPhone. Why all the paper books? The books and information in there (and in the leaflets and other printed stuff) is available for download. <span style="color:#ff0000;">See above</span></em><br />
<em> 32) Powermonkey I take to be a battery for electronics. I carried one all last year, a Mophie 4200MAh unit, and only used it a couple of times. I charge my phone with a Tout Terrain “The Plug” powered from my front hub generator. I don’t like the sound of that “bag of accessories.” <span style="color:#ff0000;">All the accessories won&#8217;t be going with me, just the one or two plugs that I need. The PowerMonkey is an amazing piece of equipment and comes with solar panels for charging when there is no access to a mains plug. You may be interested in reading <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/2013/04/30/the-powermonkey-extreme-power-problem-solved-cycling-powermonkeys/" target="_blank">this post</a> that I wrote about my experiences with solar chargers in 2010.</span></em><br />
<em> 33) iPad mini AND iPhone? If you are an enthusiast, maybe, but it seems like a lot for a bicycle trip. <span style="color:#ff0000;">I am! I&#8217;m also doing a lot of writing (in 2010 I tapped out 30,000 words on the iPhone and at times it was a little tedious). The mini iPad is the perfect size for doing such &#8216;work&#8217;.</span></em><br />
<em> 34) The camera is a good, small model, but with it’s charger, batteries, adaptors, cards and their care and storage, I leave mine home. The iPhone has a decent camera. <span style="color:#ff0000;">See above</span></em><br />
<em> 35) You have a notebook in addition to the phone and iPad? I created and wrote my blog on my phone, using voice-memos and learning to type fast on it. <span style="color:#ff0000;">See above. Sometimes, more private thoughts are best expressed on paper. It&#8217;s the poet in me I&#8217;m afraid&#8230; And I may be tempted to sketch from time to time!</span></em><br />
<em> 36) I don’t use a cyclocomputer any more, but I used to, and I understand the appeal. I don’t miss mine. <span style="color:#ff0000;">It&#8217;s a very small one and is useful for quickly checking distances, speeds etc&#8230; The iPhone app is a little more cumbersome to consult while cycling.</span></em><br />
<em> 37) Years ago I gave up bicycle gloves. One less item to keep track of. This requires that I set the bike up more precisely to control the weight on my hands, and better set-up is a good thing. I carry leather dress gloves (with the lining removed), light wool liners, lighter polypropylene liners, and waterproof over-mitts, which covers a range of conditions. <span style="color:#ff0000;">On the occasions that I haven&#8217;t worn gloves I have suffered so again, they are coming with me!</span></em><br />
<em> 38) A plastic mug. Again I choose a titanium mug. Plastic cracks, melts, burns, and stains. <span style="color:#ff0000;">My University of York plastic mug has served me well for over 20 years! It&#8217;s almost a personal friend 🙂</span></em><br />
<em> 39) I hope your Swiss Army knife is a tiny one. <span style="color:#ff0000;">It&#8217;s a small one yes but it could do with a sharpen.</span></em><br />
<em> 40) Razors, OK. Insect repellant is largely ineffective, smelly and hard to clean off, soils the clothing, and is often toxic. I carry a mosquito head net. Same for sun block; I use a hat. In the desert, a band-aid on my nose and tops of my ears. <span style="color:#ff0000;">I&#8217;m suspecting that you haven&#8217;t read my book as I had terrible problems with mosquitoes in Italy in 2010. I solved them problem by starting to use a product called Autan. The stuff I taking with me this year is similar so again, it&#8217;s non-negociable I&#8217;m afraid.</span></em><br />
<em> 41) The pharmaceuticals are your choice, but I have found little use for them over the years. I have learned to approach health from a pro-active, preventative approach, and healing from a food-and-local-remedy perspective. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Great advice&#8230; but cure may be just as important as prevention if the circumstances dictate.</span></em><br />
<em> 42) The phone mount I have mentioned above. With no map, cyclometer or phone on the dashboard, attention is focussed outward for navigation information, which places a person more definitely in the landscape and increases skill and ability. With a cyclocomputer, one never really learns to estimate distances properly. <span style="color:#ff0000;">See comments above about maps.</span></em><br />
<em> 43) Bottles can be opened with almost anything, including the bottle openers on your multi-tool and Swiss Army knife. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Agree &#8211; I need to check if the Swiss Army knife has a corkscrew on it (I think it does) in which case the bottle opener will probably stay at home.</span></em><br />
<em> 44) A knife, of course, and a spoon. A fork is redundant. If you can’t get it with a spoon, and you can’t get it with a knife, a fork is not going to help. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Again, good point but what if I invite someone around for dinner&#8230;?</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>As for clothing, I favor merino wool shorts, tights, jerseys and socks for most weather. Merino wool can be aired out overnight and smell good; polypro and most synthetics are very hard to keep fresh. In the heat, lycra shorts and jerseys, rinsed daily. A Gore-Tex bicycle suit is nearly always enough, but I carry an extra ultra-light hooded Gore-Tex shell for extreme weather (it will go over my goose-down jacket, which my bicycle suit will not). On a long trip I carry no other, off-the-bike clothing. What for? In the last forty years I have very rarely wished I had some civilian clothing along. I feel fine at any gathering in bike clothing and shoes. <span style="color:#ff0000;">My clothing is mainly made up of quick drying materials that are designed specifically for sporting activities if not specifically cycling. I will be taking off-bike clothes for all the lavish dinner parties that I will be attending (although I think I&#8217;ll leave the dinner jacket at home)!</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>You did not mention cook kit. I use a minimalist alcohol stove, kettle, Sierra cup, 12-oz. bowl, and spoon, all titanium; aluminium foil a windscreen; and two 8-oz. Nalgene bottles for alcohol. I carry 1-oz. Nalgene bottles for salt, pepper, garlic powder, 8-oz. for olive oil. That’s it. Usually I use it only for dinner. <span style="color:#ff0000;">When I cycled to Italy in 2010 I left all of my camping equipment in a hotel in Luxembourg. Remember that I am cycling through Europe, a continent that is dripping with cafes, supermarkets and restaurants. My favourite meal three years ago consisted of some beer, a baguette and some cheese. Wonderful!</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>My entire kit is 48 pounds with water and fuel, without groceries. Everything goes in the panniers; I do not stack the rear rack. On this last trip I took my mandolin in its hard-shell case and five harmonicas, an extra nine pounds, purely an indulgence. <span style="color:#ff0000;">I&#8217;m a guitarist&#8230; Now there&#8217;s an idea!</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>I have met cyclotourists with twice as much weight as I was carrying, doing much more work and camping in no more comfort than I was. I often wonder what is in those stacks of stuff (poorly attached with bungee cords) that I see people carrying on the rear rack, and I wonder what good it does them. The world is not flat, mostly. I have toured with less, and put up with the lack when it arose, very happily.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>I hope you have found my comments useful. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Very. Many thanks for putting down your thoughts. It has certainly made me think carefully about the things I will be taking. I stand ready to eat my words when I set off in ten days&#8217; time.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Sincerely,</em></p>
