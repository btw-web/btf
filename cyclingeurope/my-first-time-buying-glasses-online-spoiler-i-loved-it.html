<h1>My First Time Buying Glasses Online (Spoiler &#8211; I loved It!)</h1>

<p class="has-cyan-bluish-gray-color has-text-color"><em>By Susan Sierra Lorenzana </em></p>



<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">Have you recently had your eyes checked and got a prescription from your optometrist? Well, if you’re reading this article, chances are that you’re out in the market for a new pair of stylish glasses that will help you see and look better. I recently bought these <a href="https://www.smartbuyglasses.co.uk/designer-eyeglasses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">glasses online</span></a> from <a href="https://www.smartbuyglasses.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SmartBuyGlasses</span></a> and had a great experience, unlike any time when I shopped from a regular optical store. Let me tell you all about it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Now thanks to Covid-19, I was nervous about going to a store and choosing after trying on a bunch of different frames. And going by how picky and indecisive I am, I found SmartBuyGlasses to be a true shopper’s paradise. I don’t think I have ever seen such a huge variety of glasses and sunglasses. They have every single color and model number which regular stores don’t really have. On top of that, they guarantee the best price. After I placed my order, I saw the same frames on another site for $20 less and after I reached out to their customer service, they refunded me the difference as soon as my order was shipped!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">What really made the difference in shopping with them was the support from their <a href="https://www.smartbuyglasses.co.uk/optical-centre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">optician</a>, Chloe. After I placed my order she emailed me, asking me some questions about my prescription. She was so kind, helpful, and prompt, she helped me finally understand what lens index means &#8211; something I would typically just look at in a card form while shopping in-store and pick the one with the best price. I loved that they went the extra mile for me, adding a truly personal touch. It took much less time than going in for an appointment with my eye doctor, and I didn’t need to deal with the risk of my appointment getting canceled like everything else is these days.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Actually, it wasn’t just Chloe that made the experience so great. I also used their super cool Virtual Try-On tool which helped me accurately see how my new glasses would look on me. This was a lot of fun. I took a selfie video on their website, which then told me my face shape and suggested the kind of frames that would flatter me the most. I wish I needed to shop for glasses more often!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The whole process took me less than an hour, compared to the hours I would have spent at a store, feeling confused and under pressure. If you’re shopping at SmartBuyGlasses, I recommend checking out their <a href="https://www.smartbuyglasses.co.uk/designer-eyeglasses/blue-light-glasses?feature=blue-light-glasses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blue light blocking glasses</a>: a must-have in my opinion, given all the time we’re spending on our screens these days. These are glasses that protect the eyes from the harmful effects of blue light emitted by screens. Even if you don’t have a prescription, I recommend getting a pair. Wearing them at least in the late evening before bedtime has been helping me sleep better. Did you know that too much blue light blocks melatonin production? That’s the hormone that helps us go to sleep.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I would also recommend checking out their photochromic lenses. If you live in sunny Florida or California and spend a lot of time in the sun or are driving for long hours, it’s the best way to protect your eyes from harmful UV rays. The sun really is our enemy; it can speed up cataract formation, retinal degeneration, and lead to wrinkles! Photochromic glasses have lenses that react with UV rays to darken in sunlight and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">SmartBuyGlasses has definitely made me smarter when it comes to eye health and I’m sure you’ll feel the same way when you shop with them. If you’re not looking for designer brands, you’ll be happy to know that they even have £6 <a href="https://www.smartbuyglasses.co.uk/designer-eyeglasses/SmartBuy-Collection/?brand=smartBuy-collection&amp;price=~9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frames</a>! This is music to my ears as I tend to leave my glasses anywhere and everywhere and have had a few mishaps here and there.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I can’t stress enough how amazing this experience was. Have you shopped with them before? Tell me all about it!</p>
