<h1>Blogging, Shopping &amp; Dithering</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I need to get back into the habit of blogging while on the move. Apart from this summer&#8217;s epic cycle (is it really &#8216;epic&#8217; or is it just me trying to spin?), I&#8217;m off to France in just under three weeks with a small group of 15 year olds on the French exchange and then, only a few days after my return from the Normandy town of Falaise (worryingly the Apple spell checker wants to correct the spelling to &#8216;malaise&#8217; &#8211; Falaise incidentally means &#8216;cliff&#8217; in French which only makes me wonder if there is a &#8216;Bob&#8217;, &#8216;Eric&#8217;, &#8216;Colin&#8217; &amp; &#8216;Norman&#8217; dotted around France; there must be a &#8216;Norman&#8217; somewhere in Normandy, no? But I digress&#8230;). So, after the trip to France, I&#8217;m off to the High Tatras in Slovakia with a couple of friends for a walking holiday. Then on the 1st July it&#8217;s the, err&#8230; epic cycle from Greece to Portugal. All that to make the point that I need to get blogging again!<br />
So, here I am, sitting outside the Caffè Nero by the canal in Reading after a couple of hours trawling the shops for some of the things I need for the aforementioned trips. Phone mount for Reggie, cycling clothing, walking clothing, guide books for the cycling &amp; Normandy are the items that come to mind on my mental shopping list. But in two hours of wandering I have bought only two things; a Mother&#8217;s Day card &amp; a large bag of value tea lights. Hardly the stuff of adventure travelling and as far as the tea lights go I&#8217;m sure it would be cheaper just to turn on more lights. I&#8217;m a bit of a ditherer when it comes to making purchases. It&#8217;s not that I am reluctant to spend money, it just terrifies me that I am not buying what I consider to be the best things at the best prices. Take guide books for example. In W.H.Smith they have an offer of &#8216;buy one guide book &amp; get a second at half price&#8217; which is not a bad deal when you consider that your average Rough Guide is priced at the wrong side of £15. Unfortunately (well actually it is fortunately if you think about it), the publishers are in the process of creating a &#8216;new edition&#8217; of the range (and making a big thing of doing so by stating that the new versions are just that it big letters on the spine) and so far I have the new edition Rough Guides to Greece &amp; Spain at home. I still need the Croatia, Italy &amp; French new editions. Anyway at Smith&#8217;s they have the new France guide but only the old Italy one. In Waterstone&#8217;s they have both new versions but since the Russian guy took over, they have ditched the &#8216;buy two get one free offer&#8217;. Result: I buy nothing&#8230; Similar situation in Blacks where I went to buy a new fleece for the mountains (and the chilly evenings along the Med &#8211; I know what you are thinking but don&#8217;t say it; I will be making a couple of forays into the mountains). Different brands, different prices, different deals, different meanings of &#8216;medium&#8217;. I end up buying nothing as the devil on my shoulder keeps reminding me maliciously that there will be a better deal next week or down the road at Cotswold Leisure. And then there is of course the Internet where there must be better deals but where you can&#8217;t discover whether &#8216;small&#8217; means &#8216;small&#8217; or &#8216;large&#8217;. In Evans I took a cursory glance at the cycling accessories, clothes (&amp; briefly the bikes themselves) but not with any expectation of buying anything. I did wonder why I had made the effort to walk just outside the town centre to pay them a visit; I was just a cycling pilgrim paying my respects but with no intention of putting any of my money in the collection box.<br />
So here I am with my card and my tea lights, listening to Don McLean who is reminiscing about driving his Chevy to the levee. Perhaps it&#8217;s time to buy a car and join him. But is March the best time to buy vintage American cars? And they are probably cheaper on the Internet&#8230;</p>
