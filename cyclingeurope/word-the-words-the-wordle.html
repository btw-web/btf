<h1>Word, The Words &amp; The Wordle</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as with the first book, the first thing that I needed to do requires nothing more than a bit of patience and a lot of copying and I have spent several hours today doing just that. I am conscious of not just publishing a blog. If you want to read the blog you can trawl through the 70,488 words that I wrote during the cycle from Greece to Portugal on this website. Should you choose to do so I&#8217;ve even provided you with <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/the-next-adventure-201/index-of-posts/">a handy index of the posts</a>. The book will be a different beast altogether; much more reflective, more informative, more entertaining and even perhaps at times educational and instructional (although not <em>too</em> instructional; it&#8217;s not my style). I want you to read a book, not a blog and I&#8217;m proud to say that if you ploughed through &#8216;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-Vibrations-Crossing-Europe-Called/dp/1849142130/ref=tmm_pap_title_0" target="_blank"><strong><em>Crossing Europe on a Bike Called Reggie</em></strong></a>&#8216; you did just that. Very little of what was written at the time of the cycle survived to be published in the book. On the odd occasion when I did quote directly from what had been written on the blog I tried to make it abundantly clear that I was doing so. The best example of this was a post entitled <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/2010/07/25/24-hour-eating-at-pizza-hut/">24 Hour Eating At Pizza Hut</a> which seemed so popular at the time that I thought I better not fiddle with it and ruin the effect.</p>

It&#8217;s astonishing to think that one of my fingers hit the screen of either my mini iPad or my iPhone a total of 376,933 (at the very least) during the writing of the blog. 70,000 of those taps were merely to place a gap between the words! My word document as it stands is summarised in the box shown on the right. Below is what it looks like on my computer although I suggest you don&#8217;t reach for the magnifying glass just yet&#8230;<a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-09-29-at-16-57-04.png"><img data-attachment-id="27586" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2013/09/29/word-the-words-the-wordle/screen-shot-2013-09-29-at-16-57-04/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-09-29-at-16-57-04.png?fit=1218%2C611&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1218,611" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2013-09-29 at 16.57.04" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-09-29-at-16-57-04.png?fit=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-09-29-at-16-57-04.png?fit=890%2C446&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-27586" alt="Screen Shot 2013-09-29 at 16.57.04" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-09-29-at-16-57-04.png?resize=500%2C250" width="500" height="250" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The job of writing the book will start at the beginning of November. I need a couple of months for the rose-coloured spectacles to descend upon the bridge of my nose in order that I can write something of quality and hopefully warmth and wit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Something else that the mundane process of copying the blog posts into a Word document has allowed me to do is create a <a href="http://www.wordle.net/" target="_blank">Wordle</a>. Below is the top 100 word Wordle for the 70,488 words I wrote during the cycle. Wordle&#8217;s insistence upon ignoring the apostrophe creates some interesting nonsense words (but I&#8217;m sure you can guess what they were originally for example &#8216;wasn&#8217; should be &#8216;wasn&#8217;t&#8217; etc&#8230;). I am delighted that &#8216;campsite&#8217; seems slightly larger than &#8216;hotel&#8217; and also that &#8216;reggie&#8217; squeezes into the top 100. I did lots of things &#8216;one&#8217; time, sometimes &#8216;two&#8217; times and occasionally &#8216;three&#8217; times. The only country in the Wordle is &#8216;Greece&#8217; and that does intrigue me. Perhaps I kept reminiscing about the place long after I had cycled on&#8230; Your own comments are welcome.<a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-09-29-at-17-21-17.png"><img data-attachment-id="27587" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2013/09/29/word-the-words-the-wordle/screen-shot-2013-09-29-at-17-21-17/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-09-29-at-17-21-17.png?fit=838%2C362&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="838,362" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2013-09-29 at 17.21.17" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-09-29-at-17-21-17.png?fit=300%2C130&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-09-29-at-17-21-17.png?fit=838%2C362&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-27587" alt="Screen Shot 2013-09-29 at 17.21.17" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-09-29-at-17-21-17.png?resize=500%2C215" width="500" height="215" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It&#8217;s interesting to compare this Wordle with the one I created back in 2010 with the 38,000 words in the blog posts about cycling along the Eurovelo 5. You can see it <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/2010/08/25/eurovelo-5-wordle/">here</a>. <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/2011/06/09/wordle-updated/">Here&#8217;s another</a> that I made having written 90,000 of the eventual 110,000 of &#8216;Crossing Europe on a Bike Called Reggie&#8217;.</p>
