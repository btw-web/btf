<p class="has-text-align-justify">That was back in the summer of 2013 as I made my way along the Mediterranean coastline from Greece to Portugal. It was the briefest of visits to Slovenia &#8211; just 30 km over the course of a few hours &#8211; but it was difficult not to be impressed. My route, across the south-western corner of the country, can be seen on the map below in blue:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">So, all things considered, I didn&#8217;t get much of a chance to &#8216;experience&#8217; the country in any meaningful way, but it sticks in my mind as a delightful few hours of cycling in the sun along a green and very pleasant valley. Perhaps, however, it&#8217;s time to return&#8230;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A few days ago I attended an online event organised by the Slovenian Tourist Board which introduced two cycling routes that may well be worth adding to the &#8216;to do&#8217; list; the Julian Alps Bike Trail and the Drava Cycle Route. Two of the presenters on Zoom were actually streaming their talks live from the Slovenian wilderness&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;which was a clever way of showcasing the beautiful countryside. But to the cycling!</p>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Julian Alps Bike Trail</span></strong></p>



<p>This is a new route, broken down into 8 stages of around 35 km each. It reaches 1,600 m at its highest point and there are campsites in all of the main stopover towns that form the loop.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">I dare say the route is more mountain-bike friendly than touring-bike friendly although if you are bikepacking I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d manage just fine. The Slovenian authorities seem keen to cater for all types of cycle tourists, as is clear from the following short video:</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Drava Cycling Route</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This, I think, is a much more established route than the Julian Alps Trail although to my shame, I had never heard of the river that it follows never mind the route itself.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Much more information can be found on <a href="https://dravabike.si/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Drava Bike website</a>.

<p>You can find much more information about cycling in Slovenia on the dedicated cycling pages of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.slovenia.info/en/things-to-do/active-holidays/biking" target="_blank">Slovenian Tourist Board&#8217;s website</a>.
