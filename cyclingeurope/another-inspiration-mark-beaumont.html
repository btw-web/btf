<h1>Another Inspiration: Mark Beaumont</h1>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/man-who-cycled-the-world.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/man-who-cycled-the-world.jpg?w=890" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> A few developments since I last wrote:<br />1. I have been discovered &#8211; by the people I know who spend their summers in Puglia and whose idylic holiday destination / yoga retreat you can link to over there on the right under &#8220;The destination in Puglia&#8221;. Check out their site. Some of the photos are mine!!<br />2. After last Sunday&#8217;s failure to follow the route 4 to London, I felt frustrated so yesterday&#8230; I tried again. And what a cycle it was. A lot longer than the road route &#8211; I set off at 11.30 and got to central London at around 6pm (in fact, the bells of Big Ben were donging their dongs as I cycled past). But how beautiful the route was. From Windsor it followed the Thames through to central London. It is hard to imagine that London is one of the World&#8217;s greatest centres of life if you take the route I followed yesterday. I cycled through Windsor Great Park, Richmond Park, along the Thames past Hampton Court Palace&#8230; If I ever have a cycle mad visitor staying with me here in Reading, I will certainly encourage them to do the same thing.<br />3. There was a documentary on TV tonght about a Scottish chap called Mark Beaumont who decided to cycle around the World. &#8220;In August 2007, the 24 year-old Scot left Paris at the start of an 18,000-mile journey across four continents, one of the greatest endurance challenges ever attempted. Aiming to cover 100 miles a day, he faces the challenge of finding food and water while racing against the clock. Crossing Europe, he battles with broken spokes, faces soaring temperatures, and tackles the terrifying traffic of rush-hour Istanbul.&#8221; Strangely enough I too was in Paris on the 4th August 2007 when he set off but I can&#8217;t say that our paths met. He ended the programme, as it says above in Istanbul. Very instructive to my August 2010 plan. You can visit his website at <a href="http://www.pedallingaround.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pedallingaround.com</a> and I shall add him to my website list over there on the right. What a guy!</p>
