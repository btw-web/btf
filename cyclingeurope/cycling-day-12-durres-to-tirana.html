<h1>Cycling Day 12: Durres To Tirana</h1>
<p>There isn&#8217;t a great deal to tell about today&#8217;s cycling (well shut up then!) but for the sake of completeness, here goes (at which point everyone has found something more interesting to do. Anyone still there? I could say anything! It&#8217;s all a lie! I&#8217;m really sitting at my computer in my flat in Reading making the whole thing up. It&#8217;s Capricorn 1 all over again&#8230; Shut up!) It was a cycle of only 34km &amp; I chose to follow the back roads to the capital and yes, you know what that meant. It was option B all over again. Every bone in my body was shaken, was rattling by the end and it&#8217;s a miracle I didn&#8217;t take a roll. (You&#8217;d have missed that clever use if &#8216;shake, rattle &amp; roll if you&#8217;d gone elsewhere. Thanks for sticking with it.)<br />
Tirana is a well-hidden city surrounded by hills and I didn&#8217;t really see it coming. I knew where it was by reference to my map but there were really no visual clues before I was welcomed by a large gantry proclaiming my entrance into the city. Initially very busy, certainly for a Sunday morning, things seem to calm as I moved away from the predominantly residential suburbs to the more business-orientated centre. (That&#8217;s not rocket science!) I&#8217;m not sure of the religious breakdown here &#8211; there are minarets and churches (I&#8217;ve heard the call to prayer as well as the bells, seen the hijab as well as nuns) and to what extent Sunday is a day of rest of work. Certainly the banks &amp; offices were shut but everything else open.<br />
I found a corner fast food place and munched a sandwich as I found my lovely hotel on the Internet. I&#8217;m sold on this turn up, log on, check in thing.<br />
It was then a case of hanging around for a couple of hours before I could take up residence at 1pm. Damn! Two hours to kill in a city I&#8217;ve never visited before and an inviting café where I could sit and watch the World go by. It was so good I&#8217;ve returned now to do exactly the same now while writing this update. Congratulations if you hung around to the end. Here are some pretty pictures to amuse you further&#8230;</p>
