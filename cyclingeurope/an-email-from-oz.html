<h1>An email from Oz</h1>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Just recived the following email from a guy in Adelaide. My comments to his various points are in red&#8230;.</span><br /><em><span style="color:#000099;">Hey Andrew,</span></em><br /><span style="color:#000099;"><em>My name is Ian Hendry and I&#8217;m from Adelaide, South Australia (yes, Tour Down Under territory). I have just been reading your Puglia 2010 blog after googling away looking for Eurovelo 5 info&#8230;seems we have a similar thing in mind. I am looking at London to Rome 2010. Your blog is very good, btw 🙂</em> </span><span style="color:#ff0000;">I didn&#8217;t pay him to say this 🙂 &#8211; thanks Ian</span><br /><em><span style="color:#000099;">I found your googlemaps plot along the A2 very useful as EV5 data is hard to come by in detail and the route out of London was a curious thing to me.</span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#000099;">My goal is either June, July or August in 2010, so not far from your goal. I&#8217;m staying fairly flexible with dates as it&#8217;s dependant on work and rec leave etc.</span></em><br /><span style="color:#000099;"><em>As I&#8217;m from Australia, I was wondering what you know about the A2 road out of London. Is it a dedicated cycle way or a shoulder lane? Google Earth is a powerful tool, but I was wondering if you had cycled the London-Dover route before.</em> <span style="color:#ff0000;">Regarding the map on Google Maps, don&#8217;t take this as more than an indication of what the route might be. In the UK we have a fabulous signed cycle network &#8211; see the <a href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-we-do/national-cycle-network">Sustrans website</a> for more info about this. You can see that from London down to Dover (and the ferry) it is <a href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-we-do/national-cycle-network/route-numbering-system/40">route 1</a>. You can see that actually it goes all the way to Edinburgh if you fancy a challenge! The green bits of the route on the map are off road and you can see that a fair bit of route 1 from London to Dover is green. When it is on road, the national cycle network tends to be well segregated from the road itself, very often a shared path with pedestrians although this isn&#8217;t brilliant for picking up a bit of speed.</span><em> I&#8217;m super pleased to see you have a similar goal and I wish you well with your planning. You seem to have done some cycling before.</em> <span style="color:#ff0000;">I&#8217;m doing more and more as time goes by &#8211; I sold my car a couple of years ago and have been on the bike ever since.</span><em> Over here cycle networks are nonexistent but I prefer road riding over veloway. I cycle a little bit (25km round trip to work each day</em> <span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8211; I bit more than me: my commute is a 20 km round trip</span><em>) and do a lot of running so I&#8217;m looking forward to the training to get my cycling endurance right up there.</em> <span style="color:#ff0000;">Me too: I have 370 days to get super fit and am up for the challenge!!</span> <em>Let me know what distance you hope to cover each day.</em> <span style="color:#ff0000;">I need to average about 80 kms a day I think but I need to do more planning on this&#8230;</span> <em>I can&#8217;t estimate a distance for myself just yet as I have to assess my endurance shortly to train up.</em> </span><span style="color:#ff0000;">Me too!</span><br /><span style="color:#000099;"><em>Great to see another rider planing to take on this ride&#8230;I really cant wait to get going, but accept there is some hard graft ahead.</em> </span><span style="color:#ff0000;">It&#8217;s fantastic to get emails like this: keep in touch!</span><br /><span style="color:#000099;"><em>Take it easy and I&#8217;ll keep reading your blog.</em> </span><span style="color:#ff0000;">Hope you don&#8217;t mind that you have become part of it. 🙂</span><br /><em><span style="color:#000099;">Ian Hendry</span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#000099;">Glenelg, Adelaide, South Australia.</span></em></p>
