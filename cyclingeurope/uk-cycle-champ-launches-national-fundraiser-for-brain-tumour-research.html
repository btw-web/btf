<p class="x_MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Former cycling champion Phil Corley has launched a national fundraiser to help find a cure for brain tumours.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><img data-attachment-id="175616" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2019/01/07/uk-cycle-champ-launches-national-fundraiser-for-brain-tumour-research/screenshot-2019-01-05-at-07-09-45/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/screenshot-2019-01-05-at-07.09.45.png?fit=570%2C230&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="570,230" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="screenshot 2019-01-05 at 07.09.45" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/screenshot-2019-01-05-at-07.09.45.png?fit=300%2C121&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/screenshot-2019-01-05-at-07.09.45.png?fit=570%2C230&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="  wp-image-175616 alignright" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/screenshot-2019-01-05-at-07.09.45.png?resize=221%2C89&#038;ssl=1" alt="screenshot 2019-01-05 at 07.09.45" width="221" height="89" data-recalc-dims="1" />Phil, ex National Road Race Champion, who now runs one of the UK’s leading independent cycle retailers, is hoping hundreds will follow his lead and take part in <em>&#8216;On Yer Bike&#8217;</em> for Brain Tumour Research. And he has a very personal reason to support the campaign as he lost his own brother to the disease.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Phil’s brother Richard was 44 when he died in 1990 leaving a wife and two small children who are now grown up and have families of their own – grandchildren Richard never got to meet.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Taking place in February, &#8216;<em>On Yer Bike</em>&#8216; is a chance for everyone from committed cyclists – like Phil and his customers who are used to putting in high mileage out on the roads or on turbo trainers – to those more used to the odd spinning class at the gym or cycling as a family, to get involved and raise money for a great cause. Participants select a sponsorship target, set up a fundraising page and can then track their performance, keeping an eye on their ranking on the national leader board, to see who will cover the most miles from 1 February to 23 February.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of 40 yet, historically just 1% of the national spend on cancer research has been allocated to this devastating disease and the <a href="https://www.braintumourresearch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">Brain Tumour Research</a> charity is proud to be changing this.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;On Yer Bike&#8217; has been running since 2012 when it was launched as a local event by brain tumour patient Paul Halfpenny from Derbyshire. Sadly, Paul passed away in 2014 but the event continued and now takes place nationwide.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">The 2019 event is expected to be popular with road cyclists, and particularly those who are training for the big events in the sports calendar as this year, for the first time, participants can track their progress on an all-new website <a href="http://www.onyerbikechallenge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">www.onyerbikechallenge.org</a></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Cyclists can upload their training and mileage from their wearable technology and so compete against each other on an individual and team basis.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">A professional cyclist and National Road Race Champion in 1978, Phil’s business Corley Cycles is based in Milton Keynes; the city is also home to Brain Tumour Research. Other big names who have held the prestigious title include Geraint Thomas (2010), Bradley Wiggins (2011), Ian Stannard (2012) and Mark Cavendish (2014).</p>

<p class="x_MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><i> </i><i>“Many cyclists may well be putting in lots of mileage during February as they prepare for upcoming events and I would ask them to register and take part in On Yer Bike. It’s a great way of raising money for such an important cause and perhaps it will give them some increased motivation as well.</i></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;"><i> </i><i>“Sadly, brain tumours are indiscriminate and can affect anyone at any age. They are all too prevalent and many people, like my own family, have been affected this cruel disease.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="x_MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">Brain Tumour Research funds sustainable research at Research Centres of Excellence in the UK; it also campaigns for the Government and the larger cancer charities to invest more in research into brain tumours in order to speed up new treatments for patients and, ultimately, to find a cure. The charity is calling for an annual spend of £35m in order to improve survival rates and patient outcomes in line with other cancers such as breast cancer and leukaemia.</p>
