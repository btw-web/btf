<h1>Strange endings&#8230;</h1>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/p1000994.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/p1000994.jpg?w=890" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> It didn&#8217;t end there. Strange things were about to happen in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Trafalger</span> Square. First of all, Cat Woman was removed and replaced. Just before she was replaced, I had been thinking what I would do if I were to be stuck on top of the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">plinth</span>. I imagined it would have to have something to do with a bike, probably I would take a bike up there with me. And then, the neon jackets appeared again with their cherry picker&#8230;. and replaced Cat Woman with a suited man and a&#8230;. bike. How bizarre is that?</p>
<div>But it became even more surreal. The suited man didn&#8217;t do a great deal. The bike was upside down and everyone was watching, including his family who appeared to have turned up en <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">masse</span>. Then there was a low throb in the air, a buzzing that could only be a helicopter. It had Virgin written on the side so I have expected that Sir Richard <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Branson</span> would jump out and be part of the elaborate stunt with bike man atop of the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">plinth</span>. But the helicopter didn&#8217;t land. It continued to buzz around. On the third circle above <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Trafalgar</span> Square you could see that it said &#8220;Ambulance&#8221; underneath so I presumed <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Branson</span> was not about to appear. But then, very strangely, it landed, in the middle of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Trafalgar</span> Square. Yes, it landed. Bike man on the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">plinth</span> had become a mere side show. The helicopter was something else. Loud, cool, like in a Hollywood movie. One woman sat nearby said that she expected Bruce Willis to jump out in a Die Hard kind of moment. After landing, the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">engine</span> was cut and the blades stopped whirring&#8230;. and then Bike man dropped his bike off the top of the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">plinth</span>. Was he trying to regain the attention of the crowd. It had fallen into the net around the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">plinth</span> and he <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">successfully</span> made an attempt (with his tie) to retrieve it. He then stripped down into cycling Lycras and s<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">at</span> on top of it. This was better than a West End show! I couldn&#8217;t stand anymore excitement and headed home. What a fun afternoon. 🙂</div>
