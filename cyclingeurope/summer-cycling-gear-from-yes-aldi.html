I wrote about the items in a post called &#8216;<a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/2013/09/27/cycling-gear-from-err-aldi-aldiuk/" target="_blank">Cycling Gear From&#8230; Errr&#8230; Aldi</a>&#8216;. As you might guess from the title I was a little surprised that Aldi actually sold cycling gear and, if you read the piece itself, you&#8217;ll discover that I was a little taken aback as to what good quality stuff they were selling bearing in mind the cost. Well, Spring is here and Aldi is about to launch its summer cycling gear range. They&#8217;ve sent me a few items to review and I&#8217;m delighted to say that I am equally impressed as I was last September with the winter stuff. From the feedback I received following the previous post, I&#8217;m clearly not the only person out there who thinks the clothing is good value. I also learnt that the Aldi cycling gear sells out pretty fast so you need to get down to one of their shops as soon as you can after either the 4th May or 29th June as these are the two dates on which the gear is made available. This is what Aldi themselves say;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><em>&#8220;In store on 4<sup>th</sup> May and 29<sup>th</sup> June 2014 and while stocks last, Aldi is offering expert and amateur cyclists alike the chance to pick up everything they need for a summer of cycling with its range of excellent quality cycling clothing, accessories and tools. From a cycling computer (£4.99), sixteen function bicycle mini tool (£6.99), double cylinder foot pump (£5.49) and a whole host of premium quality textiles including shorts (from £7.99), gloves (£3.49), ergonomic socks (2.99), base layers (from £4.99) and cycling jackets (£15.99), Aldi has everything you could possibly need to get out on the open road and enjoy the sunshine.&#8221;</em></span></p>

The only one thing I was slightly disappointed with were the gloves where one of the pull-off loops broke when I pulled it to remove the gloves, but apart from that, brilliant! Here&#8217;s a picture of what I looked like! I&#8217;ll be on the catwalk quicker than you can say &#8216;sexy beast&#8217;. Perhaps. Anyway, <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/prl258-aldi-cycling-specialbuys-may-2014.pdf" target="_blank">here is a complete list of the stuff that&#8217;s available</a>. Soon, you could be looking just as good as me&#8230;</p>
<p>(Note: It&#8217;s been pointed out that the list refers to 2013 which is a good point but the original document provided by Aldi was dated 2014 so I can only assume that they haven&#8217;t made any changes&#8230;)</p>
