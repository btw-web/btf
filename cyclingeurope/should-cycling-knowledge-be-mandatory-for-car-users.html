<h1>Should Cycling Knowledge Be Mandatory For Car Users?</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">By Jason Furness</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you&#8217;re on the road as a cyclist, you can sometimes get the impression that those in the safety bubble of their cars can be totally oblivious to us two-wheelers. Whether you ride to work, use it for fitness, or for some outdoor time on a weekend, you&#8217;ll be used to the regular experiences of drivers thinking the cyclists don&#8217;t exist. Whether intentional or not, it is something that causes major issues, even fatalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has been much debate about how to tackle the issue, but <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2012/aug/06/cycling-lessons-driving-licence" target="_blank">one good suggestion</a> is to include a cycling proficiency element as a necessity for all learner drivers. That&#8217;s not just to amass more work on those fresh to the road, not at all, but to make them safer for everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-12-at-17-14-44.png?ssl=1"><img data-attachment-id="89011" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2015/01/12/should-cycling-knowledge-be-mandatory-for-car-users/screen-shot-2015-01-12-at-17-14-44/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-12-at-17-14-44.png?fit=695%2C459&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="695,459" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2015-01-12 at 17.14.44" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-12-at-17-14-44.png?fit=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-12-at-17-14-44.png?fit=695%2C459&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-89011" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-12-at-17-14-44.png?resize=660%2C436&#038;ssl=1" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-12 at 17.14.44" width="660" height="436" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Cycling proficiency, a thing of the past? Via <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/woodleighschool/" target="_blank">Woodleigh School</a> Flickr</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you&#8217;re starting out you are given every opportunity to familiarise yourself with what&#8217;s right and wrong when driving; what&#8217;s legal and illegal. A lot of hours’ worth of research go into reading your highway code and <a href="http://toptests.co.uk/" target="_blank">using online theory tests</a> to make sure you&#8217;re capable of maintaining road safety, but the smallest of considerations is given to cyclists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why is it a good idea? Let&#8217;s start with awareness. Unlike many of our school days, when the cycling proficiency test often went on yearly, now that&#8217;s not the case. Though youngsters will always play on bikes, is there the relevant education going on? When they get to the legal driving age, they&#8217;re not likely to be as clued up as people once were. You can even test your own cycling proficiency knowledge <a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/quiz-could-you-pass-cycling-7315073" target="_blank">with this quiz</a> that was published to highlight sometimes just how little people know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Making a driver commit to some experience on the road as a cyclist will put them in the position where you learn the most, and that&#8217;s first hand. It will highlight common mistakes drivers make to give them the vision not to do it themselves. Also, if you&#8217;ve been the subject of hasty and uncouth drivers, you might just share some more empathy towards your non-motorised road users.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Initiatives are going on to try and tackle the issues in some hotspots &#8211; look to <a href="http://www.cycletraining.co.uk/index.php?pg=187" target="_blank">CPC Cycle Training</a> for example. But a mandatory course for every driver on the road would mean that the knowledge is universal. Last year the AA also launched a <a href="http://www.ctc.org.uk/news/aa-launches-%E2%80%98think-bike%E2%80%99-awareness-campaign" target="_blank">&#8216;Think Bike&#8217; initiative</a> to try and give more cohesion to the petrol and leg power-fuelled classes on the road.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Mutual respect&#8217; was one of the key lines, but we still face disrespect on a day-to-day basis, and in a time when more people should be advised to keep their cars at home and use more environmentally friendly methods of getting around, we can&#8217;t afford for that behaviour to contribute to the bikes rusting away in the garage.</p>
