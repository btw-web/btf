<h1>Stress En Suisse</h1>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the stats;<br />
Cycling time: 6 hrs 14 mins 34 secs<br />
Distance: 103.41 kms<br />
Average speed: 16.4 kms/hr<br />
Maximum speed: 51.6 kms/hr<br />
Eurovelo 5 total: 1,426.6 kms<br />
Just a note on the statistics; they are a reflection of where the bike goes between setting off in the morning to arriving wherever I will be sleeping in the evening so include seemingly endless cycles around towns to find tourist offices or frequent doubling back to correct myself when I take the wrong road. I reckon you would have to knock off 10% of the total distance to make up for these &#8216;diversions&#8217;.<br />
So finally today I arrived at a campsite, much to my relief as there were times during the afternoon when I thought it might be on sleeping on a park bench.<br />
Basel was not really what I expected. A grimy, dark city surrounded by industrial areas. It was more like Brussels than anything else in that part of France. I cycled east in the general direction of the Swiss cycle network route 3, hoping to bump into it at some point and to my delight, I did, in a suburb of Basel. My delight was not to last. Back in the UK I dreamt of cycling in Switzerland; beautiful roads, sign posts at every corner, polite drivers&#8230; Well the reality didn&#8217;t initially meet my expectations. The roads were on a par with France but not Luxembourg. The sign posts were good but far from perfect; the road signs didn&#8217;t give distances and were nowhere near as frequently placed as they are in France, the cycling signs had gaps which left me scratching my head. I was almost ready to jump on a train at one point when the Swiss redeemed themselves in the form if a middle-aged couple who pulled over to ask the blatantly obvious question &#8220;are you lost?&#8221;.<br />
I persevered and made good progress along route 3. I successfully climbed the most arduous climb yet to Schafmatt at 810 metres (Basel is at 266 metres), had lunch at the top of the hill / mountain (when does a hill become a mountain?) and then had a leisurely downward ride (with annoyingly screechy brakes) towards Aarau my final destination&#8230;<br />
Sunday is not the best day to arrive in Switzerland. The place shuts down. Added to that the fact that today is the annual national holiday. Aarau was a ghost town, I rattled the door of the tourist office in vain. I scoured the map to find reference to a campsite; nothing. Even the hotels (second option) appeared to have closed their doors. Bugger!<br />
I sat on the steps of the tourist office pondering my options. Stay put and make a greater effort to find a hotel? Expensive in Switzerland. Wild camp? Not really an option in an area that is not &#8220;wild&#8221;; you would more likely than not be camping in someone&#8217;s garden. Cycle on to the next town with a campsite&#8230;. It was the only option so I set off to Sursee, 30 kms down the road but at least in the direction I needed to go; halfway to Lucern.<br />
Tired but relieved I arrived at around 5pm after 100 kms which included a very significant climb.<br />
On the positive side, I&#8217;m now within spitting distance of Lucern &#8211; in effect, one and a half days ahead of schedule and have spent a very pleasant evening chatting with a father and son team of bikers, Carl &amp; Nick who are busy making plans to cross the Alps and then head west towards Argeles near the Spanish border.<br />
We&#8217;ve just had a storm and the forecast for the next few days isn&#8217;t brilliant. I feel a day off coming, perhaps even tomorrow after having cycled the short distance to Lucern. Any suggestions?</p>
