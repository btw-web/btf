<h1>And The Winners Are&#8230;</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To help celebrate passing the milestone of 5,000 copies of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-Vibrations-Crossing-Europe-Called/dp/1849142130/ref=tmm_pap_title_0" target="_blank"><strong><em>Good Vibrations: Crossing Europe on a Bike Called Reggie</em></strong></a>, I asked people on Twitter &amp; Facebook to nominate people or causes who might benefit from receiving a complimentary copy of the book. I had quite a few nominations and thanks to everyone who took the time to consider the offer. There are going to be some disappointed people I&#8217;m afraid and I apologise in advance to those who I have not chosen but I have made my decision. I originally intended giving away three copies but following the response, I increased this to five. My short list contains six so for the sake of postage of one extra book, I&#8217;m going to send out six.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here are the successful nominators and nominees (in no particular order);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Karen Stuart nominated her friend Adrian Wing who is cycling from Calais to Montauroux in the south of France and <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/Adrian-Wing" target="_blank">trying to raise £20,000 for bowel cancer research</a> in the process. He gets the first copy. Good luck with the trip Adrian.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next copy goes to Chris Archer&#8217;s dad. &#8220;<em>He&#8217;s been ill recently which has put off plans for  the end to end. Your book may speed up his recovery</em>.&#8221; Well, I&#8217;ve never claimed that there are any kind of medical benefits from reading <em>Good Vibrations</em> but it&#8217;s worth a try. Well done Chris!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mark Vatcher has nominated a charity &#8211; <a href="http://www.wheelsforwellbeing.org.uk/" target="_blank">Wheels for Wellbeing</a> &#8211; &#8220;<em>they can share it</em>&#8221; he says. The charity supports disabled people to cycle. They will soon be receiving copy number three.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth book is going to another group of people; the families of patients at Simon Gregory&#8217;s intensive care unit: &#8220;<em>some relatives are there for days &amp; sometimes weeks. An inspirational read would be great for them</em>&#8220;. Let&#8217;s hope so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two more books to go and the next one is heading to Yorkshire, York to be precise to a person nominated by an old school friend, Richard Hirst. Richard has nominated one of his colleagues at York St. John University, Andy Smith. &#8220;<em>He is an expert in sport &amp; sports participation at the university &amp; he would use it to inspire the next generation</em>&#8220;. I can&#8217;t believe that I am so old that I can now refer to younger people as &#8216;the next generation&#8217; but it&#8217;s true&#8230; Good call Richard!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And so to the final book&#8230; This week is Valentine&#8217;s Day of course and one nomination did suggest that love is in the air (although if it isn&#8217;t, this will be horribly embarrassing). Neil Carrington says he would love to cycle Europe with his friend Lois. He doesn&#8217;t cite inspiration as the reason, merely that &#8220;<em>a copy of your book will keep  busy while I save up the money</em>&#8220;. There&#8217;s true love for you!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Congratulations to all the successful nominated people. I&#8217;ll be in touch via Twitter or Facebook for address etc&#8230; If you are able to send immediately, your copies of <em>Good Vibrations</em> will be in the post today. And apologies once more to the unsuccessful people. You could of course try again when we get to 10,000 books sold&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Happy cycling!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Andrew (&amp; Reggie)</p>
