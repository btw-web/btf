<p><em><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Hi Andrew<br />I keep getting drawn back to your blog and I am very envious of the trip you&#8217;re planning. I was thinking of cycling the same route but breaking it up into a few visits as I couldn&#8217;t get five weeks off work in one go. I was wondering if you were looking for any company for a week or ten days at the beginning of your trip. I was thinking I would cycle as far as I could and then get the train back. Then return later in the year to continue where I left off.<br />Let me know your thoughts and if you think it&#8217;s feasible.<br />I took up cycling at the beginning of the year and train a couple of times a week. I did the Brighton 50 in September and it&#8217;s now made me want to take on the world.<br />I&#8217;m 42 and my girlfriend says I&#8217;m having my midlife crisis. She may be right.<br />Kind regards<br />Richard Burton<br /></strong></span></em><br /><u>From</u>: Andrew<br /><u>Subject</u>: Re: Puglia 2010<br /><u>To</u>: &#8220;Richard Burton&#8221;<br /><u>Date</u>: Saturday, 12 December, 2009, 8:00</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#000099;"><strong>Hi Richard<br />Thanks for the email and glad you are following the blog which sometimes has little to do with cycling to Italy next summer!<br />Interesting proposition! &#8230;. Having some company would be an interesting thing to consider, especially in those first couple of weeks of the ride. I suppose I am at a bit of a disadvantage here as I know little about you apart from the fact that you are 42, you cycle and share a name with a famous actor. My life is on the blog, or most of it&#8230;<br />I did a search on Facebook with your email address but nothing came up apart from a prompt to invite you to join Facebook so that is what I did &#8211; you will have already received the email. Where are you based? Are you the kind of person who would drive another person nuts if they had to spend 11 days with you? Do you have convictions related to violence? That kind of thing etc&#8230;<br />Apologies for the delay in responding by the way. I tend not to function on any level apart from work from Monday 5.30pm to Friday 5pm. My postings at 4am on the blog mid-week are because I can&#8217;t sleep due to the stresses and strains of being a teacher&#8230;.<br />Look forward to hearing from you<br />Best wishes<br />Andrew<br />PS: I have put a small reference to your email on the blog &#8211; nothing too detailed &#8211; hope you don&#8217;t mind. 🙂<br /></strong></span></em><br /><u>From</u>: &#8220;Richard Burton&#8221;<br /><u>Sent</u>: Saturday, December 12, 2009 18:40 PM<br /><u>To</u>: Andrew<br /><u>Subject</u>: Puglia 2010</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color:#ff0000;">Hi Andrew<br />I haven’t joined Facebook yet as my daughter says I’m too old and I may embarrass her if her friends see me on there.<br />I live just outside Clacton in Essex with my girlfriend and our three children and work for ourselves, so we are limited to time off. &#8230;. I don’t think I’m the type to drive anyone nuts and I don’t have any convictions for violence. Although there was one time when&#8230; just kidding.<br />I started the cycling to get fit and now have the bug. So I did a little bit of research and chose a route in Europe that I could do in stages, then I came across your blog.<br />I was surprised to find someone else looking at doing the same route.<br />I was thinking (I’m still in the thinking stage) of setting off from Clacton and taking 2 days to get to Dover. Then following the Eurovelo 5 as far as I could but I can’t seem to find a very detailed map. I&#8217;m not sure whether I would camp or stay in cheap b&amp;b&#8217;s. Here comes the cheeky bit. I was wondering whether you would consider sharing your route with me. Either by meeting up each day and setting off alone or by riding some parts together. I am only in the very early thinking stage and I’m not expecting a yes or no. But it will give you another thing to think about. Sorry.<br />Regards<br />Richard<br />PS<br />I like the breaking news.</span></em></strong></div>
