Sykes.  This is the much anticipated follow-up to the acclaimed &#8216;<i>Crossing Europe on a Bike Called Reggie</i>&#8216; and recounts the author&#8217;s 2013 cycling journey from Cape Sounio at the southern tip of Greece to Cape St.Vincent in the south-western corner of Portugal:</p>

Secondary school teacher Andrew Sykes moves out of the classroom, climbs onto his bicycle and sets off along the route of the EuroVelo 8, from the southern tip of Greece to the Atlantic coast of Portugal. However, this is more than just a cycling tale of border crossings and big hills, as our would-be adventurer perspires his way through a hot and sticky mix of Mediterranean landscapes, life and culture. Join Andrew as he travels Along The Med on a Bike Called Reggie: an inspirational and light-hearted travelogue for cyclists and non-cyclists alike.&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since its publication in 2011, Andrew Sykes&#8217; first book, &#8216;<i>Crossing Europe on a Bike Called Reggie</i>&#8216; has won acclaim as an &#8216;inspirational&#8217; travelogue. The CTC described it as &#8216;a wonderful, witty account of a cycle tour across Europe&#8217;. Readers have found the author&#8217;s down to earth, self-deprecating style of writing (and cycling) both appealing and approachable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Initially available from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Along-Med-Bike-Called-Reggie-ebook/dp/B00M783KDW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406714911&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Amazon</a> as an eBook (£3.99 / €4.99 / $5.99) and in paperback (£8.99 / $14.99) from <a href="http://completelynovel.com/books/along-the-med-on-a-bike-called-reggie" target="_blank">CompletelyNovel</a> it is anticipated that the second volume of Andrew&#8217;s adventures with Reggie will become widely available online (Apple, Kobo&#8230;) as well as in bookshops nationwide in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A limited number of review copies of the book are available.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Andrew Sykes is available for interview in person, over the phone, via Skype or written questions. You can contact him directly at <a href="mailto:apsykes@hotmail.com">apsykes@hotmail.com</a> .</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;<b><i>Along The Med on a Bike Called Reggie</i></b>&#8216; is the second in a trilogy of European cycles; our traveller and author will complete the set of three with a journey from Santiago de Compostela, Spain to North Cape, Norway in 2015 with publication of the final book scheduled for 2016. He will then turn his attention to the other four continents&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Notes</b>:</p>
<p>Short biography</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Andrew P. Sykes was born and grew up in the small town of Elland, in the foothills of the Pennines in West Yorkshire. He studied for a degree in mathematics at the University of York and immediately after graduation, went to work in London for a firm of city accountants. The world of auditing was not, however, for him and in 1993, he left the UK to go and work in France, initially in the tourist industry and then for four years teaching English in the Loire Valley city of Tours. He returned to the UK in 1999 to train as a secondary school teacher of French at the University of Reading. He still lives in the town and can currently be found working as the Head of Modern Languages at a secondary school in South Oxfordshire. You may well spot him each morning and evening during term time, cycling to work through the picturesque countryside that lies between the Thames Valley towns of Reading and Henley-on-Thames.</p>
