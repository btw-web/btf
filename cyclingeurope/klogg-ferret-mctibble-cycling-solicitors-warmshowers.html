<h1>Krog, Ferret, McTibble: Cycling Solicitors?</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today is the last day of the half-term holiday&#8230; Back to work tomorrow. But skipping over five days back at the interactive whiteboard, next weekend looks interesting. If you remember a few weeks back, I had Kate Clabby staying here in Reading after she contacted me via <a href="http://www.warmshowers.org/" target="_blank">Warmshowers.org</a>. You can catch up on her travels <a href="http://www.clabbermouth.com/" target="_blank">on her website</a> which is a little bit behind where she actually is; she should now be in Ireland working on the organic farm she was aiming for. Since Kate&#8217;s overnight stop, I&#8217;ve been contacted by a couple of other touring cyclists who are passing through Reading. On Saturday, a guy called Matt Krog from South Africa is in town. Just like Kate, he is en route to Oxford and then Wales &amp; Ireland before moving down to France to cycle the <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/the-other-eurovelos/eurovelo-6/" target="_blank">Eurovelo 6</a> from Nantes to Budapest. I may ask him if he is interested in being a guest blogger for <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org" target="_blank">CyclingEurope.org</a>. With my Olympic endeavours this summer, my back side will spend much of its time in the comfort of a BMW rather than on a bicycle saddle so it would be good to follow a trans-European adventure, especially one which follows one of the Eurovelos. I don&#8217;t know much about Matt apart from what he has posted on his own website, <a href="http://mdkrog.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Matt&#8217;s Big Cycle Tour</a>. He is not an experienced cyclist &#8211; only three days in Mauritius &#8211; but he has posted the video below on his website which is simply stunning. It does make me wonder why he isn&#8217;t staying put in South Africa to do his first long cycle rather than brave a potentially cold, wet summer that he could experience in Europe. I suppose he&#8217;ll get the chance to explain himself next Saturday&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="890" height="501" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tq0oIOmlrEA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-GB&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I&#8217;ll be kicking Matt out of the flat very early on Sunday (I have warned him) as I need to attend my final Olympic training session in Grosvenor Square (the place where I will be based for the during of the games) which starts at 8am. It&#8217;s a long day &#8211; up to ten hours &#8211; and when I get back to Reading, I&#8217;ll be welcoming the second of the visiting touring cyclists. This time it will be a couple from Norway although he is British; Ross &amp; Pirkko are their names and they are travelling from Bath (via Hungerford) before heading north to Oxford and that great cycling destination of err&#8230; Birmingham. The most intriguing thing about this Scandinavian couple is the variety of names they go by. So far, I&#8217;ve been scratching my head over &#8216;Torridon Ferret&#8217; (Ross&#8217; Warmshowers profile name), &#8216;Kivikettu&#8217; &amp; &#8216;Hamish McTibble&#8217;. Are those their bikes? Whatever else, it should keep us chatting.</p>
