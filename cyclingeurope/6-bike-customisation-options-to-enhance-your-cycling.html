<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">If you’re an avid biker who is looking to give your ride a little upgrade or makeover, this is the article for you. Whether you’ve got a shiny brand new bike that you’re looking to accessorize or simply looking to give your beloved old bike a stylish new makeover, accessorizing your bike is one of the most fun ways to add a personal touch to your ride. In today’s article, we have a look at 6 bike customisation options to enhance your cycling &#8211; because <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://decathlon.com.au/collections/bikes" target="_blank">bikes</a> don’t have to be boring! Read on to find out more!</p>



<ol><li><strong>A Fresh New Paint Job</strong></li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A new paint job isn’t just something that has to be limited to your home. In fact, getting funky with some spray paint is an amazing and inexpensive way to breathe new life into your trusty ol’ bike. All you have to do to prepare your frame is to clean it and sand off any existing paint. Next up, remove all of your bike’s components and utilise masking tape to cover whichever areas you want to protect from your new paint. At this point, let your creativity flow. Why not give your bike an ombre makeover, or perhaps even a metallic or matte finish? A wide variety of <a href="https://www.spraybike.com.au/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spray paints for bikes</a> exist so explore your options and channel your inner Picasso!&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Switch Up Your Handlebar Tape</strong></li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Did you know that most pro cyclers always replace their handlebar tape anytime they’re competing in a race or challenge? Aside from ensuring that your handlebars are in mint condition (and preventing your hands from getting sore), switching your tape up is also a great way to introduce some spice to your overall bike decor. Thankfully, there are hundreds and thousands of different designs available when it comes to <a href="https://www.bicycles.net.au/2019/02/btp-bartape-in-review-any-colour-any-style-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bar tape</a> so you can ensure that your bike looks fresh, trendy and colourful at all times!&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Swap Your Saddle</strong></li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">You don’t need us to tell you that there are thousands of different saddles available for you to choose from online, but if you really want to take customisation to the next level, you’re going to want to head to the <a href="https://www.fizik.com/uk_en/configurator/all.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fizik</a> website. Fizik will customise your very own saddle for you and you can choose from a wide variety of over 20 models that range from $150 to $300, depending on your budget. Choose the colour, logo and protection that suits your personality the best in order to have the most unique saddle this side of town!&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Slap On Some Stickers</strong></li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This one is going to make your inner teenager scream. Slapping on some stickers onto your bike is possibly the easiest and most inexpensive way to really customise your beloved ride. Accessorizing with stickers takes minimal skill, cost and effort. The best part is that hundreds of online stores in 2020 offer <a href="https://www.tenstickers-australia.com/stickers-for/bike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bike sticker packs</a>, with everything from flowers to cartoon characters to motivational quotes. Bike stickers aren’t just for kids either &#8212; lots of professional cyclists and adventure seekers often customise their bike with colourful and fun stickers because why the heck not!&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Explore Colourful Components</strong></li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">If you’re someone who is looking to add a bit of “funk” to your somewhat boring looking bike, then exploring colourful components is definitely the way to go. Whether you’re looking for a super-coordinated colour scheme or prefer a little clash of colours, the best way to achieve your ideal look is with colourful pedals, stems, cranks and <a href="https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/g20007229/10-awesomely-over-the-top-bike-components/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other components</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="6"><li><strong>Funky Stem Caps</strong></li></ol>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Last but not least, don’t forget your stem caps if you’re looking to give your bike a makeover. Chances are that you’ll be spending a fair amount of time staring at your stem cap, so why not give yourself a gorgeous view with a colourful or patterned stem cap. A wide variety of designs exist online, with options such as sugar skulls, birds, slogans and other <a href="https://www.kapz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decorative designs</a> available for the picking! A unique stem cap is the best way to round off your total bike makeover!&nbsp;</p>
