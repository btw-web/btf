<h1>The Best Day So Far?</h1>
<p>What a fabulous day! The question mark in the title is merely because I have now been doing this for so many days that I am beginning to forget all of the great days I have had.<br />
This afternoon&#8217;s cycle from Morhange to Sarrebourg continued in the same manner of the morning; beautiful, rolling (I use that word too often!) countryside and good weather to boot. What I did begin to notice were the occasional elements of southern France beginning to kick in; a lavender field, the noise of the cicadas, the white-washed houses and the increasingly mountainous landscape. Only a few moments before I had taken the picture in the previous post, I had noticed in the far distance some looming hills the like of which I had yet to see on my trip south; little did I know at the time that I would be spending the night half-way up one of them.<br />
I arrived in Sarrebourg at around 4pm. I didn&#8217;t really know what to expect but I was hoping for a quiet, picturesque little place like you find in the Dordogne with a little campsite and a few bars in which to while away the evening. I was in for a bit of a let down. It was a boring town with a penchant for drabness. The fact that it wasn&#8217;t twinned with a suburb of Slough was the only remarkable thing about the place. I already knew that there wasn&#8217;t a campsite in the place which was a blessed relief. Last night I had picked up a brochure in the campsite in Metz which included a list of campsites for the department; none were listed for Sarrebourg.<br />
I asked at the tourist office about campsites and the helpful girl gave me a list of five. All were east of the town which was good in that I am heading for Strasbourg and only one of them was ideal as it was on a direct route to Strasbourg; the site in Dabo. Only one problem; it was 20 kilometres away and up a big hill.<br />
But it was only 4 pm so I thought, why not and headed for this hills. An hour or so later I found myself in a beautiful wooded landscape on a campsite high in the hills and the fact in my mind that I have successfully achieved my first major climb of the Eurovelo 5 route!<br />
Only one problem; I have made such good progress today that I am one day ahead of myself; do I take that extra day here in the mountains and stay put for two nights or do I head for Strasbourg tomorrow have an extra day in the Alsatian capital before meeting up with Claus on Friday. I&#8217;ll ponder that one over sunset in the mountains and the bottle of Bordeaux I bought in the shop down the road&#8230;.</p>
