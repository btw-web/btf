<h1>Laghi Di Monticchio</h1>
<p>If you are reading this then it is probably at least Friday, if not Saturday or Sunday. My phone no longer wants to &#8220;connect to the data network&#8221;. Apologies. You probably all think I have been murdered if you aren&#8217;t used to using the Spot tracker link just over there on the left.<br />
Just look at that picture; gorgeous isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m still looking at the real thing as I type. This is the most serene place I have visited on my long trek south. The campsite is rudimentary, but that&#8217;s how it seems to work; fantastically peaceful setting = basic (some would say &#8216;crap&#8217;) campsite. But give me one of these at the end of every day and I would never return home, I&#8217;d just keep on cycling. Wonderful for the blood pressure&#8230;.<br />
So, this afternoon. Let&#8217;s start with the statistics for Benevento to the Laghi di Monticchio; Cycling time: 6 hrs 56 mins 20 secs<br />
Distance: 115.70 kms<br />
Average speed: 16.6 kms/hr<br />
Maximum speed: 57.9 kms/hr<br />
Eurovelo 5 distance: 3,033.8 kms<br />
Leaving the service station cafe where I had lunch, the road continued along the bottom of the valley. I was never sure which road I was actually on as they numbers indicated on my map never seemed to correspond with those on signs.<br />
Then the first of the day&#8217;s climbs started; a gradual one that took me to the top of the valley and the town of Bisaccia. Some people back in the UK dislike wind turbines to the point of obsession. I love the things. I think it is a really positive way in which rural communities can be plugged into the green economy. Every time I am in West Yorkshire I look with pride towards Ovenden Moor at the collection of turbines up there. Bisaccia and its local community leads the way in having embraced the wind turbine; they are gloriously everywhere! All shapes and sizes too. It&#8217;s like Strictly Come Wind Turbine up there, all strutting their stuff wanting to impress. Hundreds of the things. It makes me feel embarrassed that I live in a part of England that still only has one wind turbine. Yes, in the whole the southern TV area there is just one solitary turbine; the one next to the Madejski Stadium in Reading. Appalling.<br />
Every climb has a silver lining; the decent. In this case it was a bit rugged, down through the town of Aquilonia which, as far as I could see had no shop where you can buy food. I would have killed for a Mars bar at that point&#8230;<br />
And this descent had a nasty sting in the tale; the ascent to the lakes themselves. A gruelling 10 kilometres of switchback roads. Eventually, exhausted, I made it to the volcanic oases in the hills and found my little evening idyl.<br />
Think of the last time you were happy and relaxed and multiply by two. That&#8217;s where I am now. Clearly the two bottles of beer help.</p>
