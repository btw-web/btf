<address><span style="color:#0000ff;">I have read plenty of accounts of climbing while touring on a loaded bike. My heroes will climb 1800 metres in a day. Last summer I left camp and tackled a small 352 m pass on one of the hottest day of the year. I think the steepest grade was 5% but for a short distance. That 18 kilometres took me four hours and led me to re-examine the day. Here are a few tips that I need to remember and follow since I retired from being Superman:</span></address>
<address><span style="color:#0000ff;">1. Avoid the heat of the day. Drink plenty of water. Siestas were invented for a reason.</span></address>
<address><span style="color:#0000ff;">2. Train more. “A busy life” is no excuse.</span></address>
<address><span style="color:#0000ff;">3. Lose weight. The extra fat I carry is the same as putting extra weight on the bike.</span></address>
<address><span style="color:#0000ff;">4. Eat foods that quickly convert to energy.</span></address>
<address><span style="color:#0000ff;">5. Be armed with good information so you know the profile of the climb. I climbed with no end in sight, this was demoralizing. After all was said and done, I was glad for the experience. Next time I do a real mountain pass I will be better prepared. I know Italia will provide the mountains and hills. I have to do the rest.</span></address>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Michael lives in Vancouver, Canada, the place with all the snow problems for the Olympics (call me euro-centric but I never consider Winter Olympic Games to be real if they are not in the European Alps; they just don&#8217;t look right anywhere else!). He contributes to <a href="http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/directory/?o=RrzKj&amp;user=respirare&amp;v=8" target="_blank">Crazy Guy on a Bike</a>, a website that has the tag line &#8220;<em>A place for bicycle tourists and their journals&#8221; </em>and I have just been reading about &#8211; no, stop; I didn&#8217;t read much of it &#8211; let&#8217;s be honest &#8211; I just looked at the pictures &#8211; so I have just been looking at some of his pictures from the trip that he refers to above in southern British Columbia. He was actually cycling there while I was making my way down the Pennine Cycleway last summer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I can&#8217;t argue with his advice, all of which is relevant to me&#8230; I have also added his &#8220;tentative pile of crap&#8221; picture to the <em>equipment</em> section of the blog. Keep reading Michael and keep commenting; I promise to read more of the text when I next visit your own site.</p>
