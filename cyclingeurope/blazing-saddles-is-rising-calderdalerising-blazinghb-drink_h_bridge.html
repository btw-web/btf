<h1>Blazing Saddles Is Rising&#8230;</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had Reggie serviced after last summer&#8217;s Tarifa to Nordkapp cycle at my new local bike shop here in the Calder Valley, Blazing Saddles in Hebden Bridge. Alas, along with many other businesses in the valley towns of Elland, Sowerby Bridge, Mytholmroyd and Hebden Bridge, Blazing Saddles was washed out by the Boxing Day floods. I was in Hebden Bridge last week and many shops &#8211; including Blazing Saddles &#8211; remain closed for drying out, repair and restocking&#8230; But Calderdale is indeed rising! If you in the area, here&#8217;s one way in which you can help out:<img data-attachment-id="164282" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2016/01/28/blazing-saddles-is-rising-calderdalerising-blazinghb-drink_h_bridge/new-special-event/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/new-special-event.jpg?fit=960%2C540&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="960,540" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="New Special Event" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/new-special-event.jpg?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/new-special-event.jpg?fit=890%2C501&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-164282 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/new-special-event.jpg?resize=890%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="New Special Event" width="890" height="501" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
