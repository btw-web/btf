<h1>Easter, Venison and Bullet Points</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nearly there. Just one more day until the second biggest reason to be a teacher starts; the Easter holidays. I know that sounds a bit cynical so apologies to those educational purists who want us all to be teachers because it is our &#8220;calling&#8221;, but we all have to be honest and the long holidays are a very big factor in our job satisfaction index and enable us to put up with our working conditions in the other thirty-nine weeks, even in leafy Henley-on-Thames where I ply my trade. Number one is, of course the summer holiday. Easter, on a relaxation scale, comes in ahead of Christmas as there is bugger all to interrupt two weeks (seventeen days this year!) of doing what you want to do&#8230;. Christmas is busy!</p>

To celebrate both the Easter holidays and this momentous period of virtuosity pre-Puglia, I will be dining tonight on venison, pommes de terres and Australian Shiraz! That does sound impressive; it is actually venison sausages, mashed potatoes and a bottle of red plonk but I am looking forward to it. I really don&#8217;t care that I have another day to work; the kids can put up with a diminished level of education for the last day of term tomorrow morning. We knock off at 2.30pm anyway after only a couple of hours of what is supposed to be meaningful work.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Catching up with all things Puglia, I feel some bullet points coming on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The Panorama (still no name for him / her) is back at the cycle shop for a few adjustments. I cycled the new bike to work this morning to see how it would cope with the 12% hill that cuts through Henley Golf Club. It passed although it wasn&#8217;t that different from the Trek. Still uncomfortable (in both a physical and spiritual sense) with the position of the handlebars, I returned home via <a href="http://www.awcycles.co.uk/" target="_blank">AW Cycles</a> for a post-purchase consultation with Darren, the guy who measured me a couple of weeks ago. He was actually busy so I spent some time with the other guy who frequents the upstairs of AW Cycles. I explained how I was feeling the riding position uncomfortable but he did manage to convince me that it was because I was so used to a very upright position with my previous bike. I&#8217;m more than happy to buy into this  and no changes are planned to the length of the stem that attaches the handlebars to the frame. I did, however, also mention how I was finding the width of the handlebars equally uncomfortable. After a couple of measurements, my cycling consultant agreed and the bike is now spending the night in the bike shop awaiting a re-fit of the handlebars. They will be replaced with a wider set and also the brakes on the top of the bars will be moved to a more central position to allow me more room to grip the bars themselves. I trudged back to Reading on foot but glad that I had addressed the issue. I was now more comfortable in the spiritual sense and I hope that soon that will be reflected in the physical sense.</div>

<div style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00rt7ss/The_Man_Who_Cycled_the_Americas_Central_America/" target="_blank">The second episode of Mark Beaumont&#8217;s excellent documentary</a> on his cycle from Alaska to Argentina continued last night on BBC1 but I only made it as far as just south of Chihuaha before I was too tired to keep my eyes open. This is not a reflection upon the documentary but a reflection upon my  stupid addiction to getting up at 5am and being at work by 6.30am. I will hopefully watch the rest of the documentary tonight. Basil, my fellow language teacher who I will be visiting in southern Italy later in the year at the end of the ride texted to inform me that riding through Bari will be more dangerous than Mexico.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;">On the subject of <a href="http://twitter.com/MrMarkBeaumont" target="_blank">Mark Beaumont</a>, he has made me one of his friends on Twitter! Thanks for that Mark. I wonder if he is a regular reader of this blog?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I received another text today from another fellow language teacher who I used to work with. She wished me a good Easter holiday and asked &#8220;is it this one where you cycle to Italy?&#8221;. It&#8217;s a good job she teaches German and not Geography. Reading to Brindisi in two weeks would be impressive!</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of bullet points. I&#8217;m off to dine on my venison sausages. 🙂</p>
