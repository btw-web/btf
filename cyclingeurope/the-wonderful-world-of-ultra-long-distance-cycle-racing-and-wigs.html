<h1>The Mysterious World Of Ultra-Long-Distance Cycle Racing (And Wigs&#8230;)</h1>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify has-white-color has-vivid-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">I think that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called &#8211; <em>Ultra-Long-Distance Cycle Racing</em> &#8211; but, if not, I&#8217;m happy to be corrected. In fact (not for the first time) I have just checked on Wikipedia and the first line of the entry for &#8216;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-distance_cycling" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ultra-Distance Cycling</span></a>&#8216; reads &#8220;<em>The definition of&nbsp;ultra-distance cycling&nbsp;is far more vague than in ultra running</em>&#8221; which is perhaps the reason why I hesitate when coming to using the term. It&#8217;s worth sticking with Wikipedia for a moment just so we know what we are talking about:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Any&nbsp;bike race&nbsp;longer than a&nbsp;century ride, which is 100 miles (160&nbsp;km), is sometimes considered to be ultra-distance cycling. However, such events are relatively common, so using a longer distance to define the category is more useful, such as any race that is longer than 200 kilometres (120&nbsp;mi), 300 kilometres (190&nbsp;mi) or even a double century, 200 miles (320&nbsp;km).</em></p><p><em>Bike races that cover these distances but which are split into&nbsp;stages&nbsp;do not fit most definitions of ultra-distance races &#8211; the clock needs to run continuously from start to finish. Even so, extra-long stages within a longer race may be long enough to be an ultra-distance race by themselves. In addition, any team events in which individual cyclists do not complete the full distance are not considered to be ultra-distance.</em></p><cite><a href="Ultra-distance cycling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia: Ultra-distance cycling</a></cite></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So, basically, the very long-distance rides you sometimes hear about, often in reverential terms; the <em>Trans Am Bike Race</em> (America west to east), the <em>Tour Divide </em>(American north to south), the <em>Transcontinental Race</em> (Europe west to east) being perhaps the most prominent three examples but there are many more. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Now I hasten to point out that I am writing this not because I plan to surprise you and announce that I have decided to enter one of these mythical rides (sorry to disappoint&#8230;) but because yesterday I recorded a fascinating chat with Dr Ian Walker for <em><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/podcast/" target="_blank">The Cycling Europe Podcast</a></strong></em> that will hopefully be published in the next week or so. In fact, I would go so far as saying that it was probably the most fascinating discussion I&#8217;ve had so far. Perhaps that was down to this &#8216;mythical&#8217;, &#8216;mysterious&#8217; status that these rides have in the cycling world. I&#8217;ll come back to the interview with Ian in a few moments but delving into the CyclingEurope.org archive, there are a few related posts that are worth examining once again. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Before the races came along, &#8216;<em>audax</em>&#8216; cycling was already well established and I first heard about this kind of cycling when I was planning my first long ride to Italy in 2009. Here&#8217;s a post about a chap who cycled from Calais to Brindisi (my destination in 2010) in just 12 days:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-cyclingeurope-org wp-block-embed-cyclingeurope-org"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>&#8230;and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Calais-Brindisi.pdf" target="_blank">here is the pdf referred to in the post</a>. (It took me five weeks by the way.) </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">At some point, someone, somewhere (probably America) must have thought that this &#8216;<em>audax</em>&#8216; malarky might make a good basis for a race and the ultra-distance races were born. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Emily Chappell wrote a hard-hitting book about being an ultra-long-distance racer in <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3bXlGtt" target="_blank">Where There&#8217;s A Will</a></em> back in 2019 and it featured in this post:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-cyclingeurope-org wp-block-embed-cyclingeurope-org"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iMwVKGqIp5"><a href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2019/11/16/where-theres-a-will-brutal-sweaty-dirty-visceral-painful-and-recommended/">Where There&#8217;s A Will: Brutal, Sweaty, Dirty, Visceral, Painful&#8230; And Recommended</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Where There&#8217;s A Will: Brutal, Sweaty, Dirty, Visceral, Painful&#8230; And Recommended&#8221; &#8212; CyclingEurope.org" src="https://cyclingeurope.org/2019/11/16/where-theres-a-will-brutal-sweaty-dirty-visceral-painful-and-recommended/embed/#?secret=iMwVKGqIp5" data-secret="iMwVKGqIp5" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It&#8217;s a book that pulls no punches and, to be frank, is more likely to scare you aware from the world of ultra-long-distance cycling than anything else. Well, that&#8217;s how I felt. Recommended nevertheless.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Emily was a friend of Mike Hall who, in 2017, was killed whilst taking part in a race across Australia. I wrote about that sad event in this post from July of that year:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-cyclingeurope-org wp-block-embed-cyclingeurope-org"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WYxQUmFUyz"><a href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2017/07/29/the-double-tragedy-of-transcontinental-race/">The Double Tragedy Of The Transcontinental Race</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;The Double Tragedy Of The Transcontinental Race&#8221; &#8212; CyclingEurope.org" src="https://cyclingeurope.org/2017/07/29/the-double-tragedy-of-transcontinental-race/embed/#?secret=WYxQUmFUyz" data-secret="WYxQUmFUyz" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Mike Hall was not only a competitor in many of the races but also instrumental in organising many of them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Which brings me back to my interview with Ian Walker yesterday. I stumbled across his name online when doing some research into the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.northcape-tarifa.com" target="_blank">Northcape to Tarifa Bike Race</a>. As someone who has cycled from Tarifa to Northcape myself (albeit somewhat more slowly than the people who compete in the race), it was obviously something that was of interest. I had already tried to contact the organisers for an interview but they didn&#8217;t seem that keen (which only added to the mysterious nature of these events &#8211; what are they hiding???). Last week I thought I&#8217;d have another go, hence my Internet wanderings. Ian&#8217;s name cropped up in the searches, not because he was associated with the Northcape to Tarifa race but because he had broken the world record for cycling between the two places; he did it in just 16 days. For purposes of comparison, it had taken me over 100 days to cycle in the opposite direction in 2015. Digging a little deeper, I discovered that Ian had only taken up the sport of ultra-long-distance cycling when he was turning 40 and that he was not only quite good but had won one of the more prestigious races, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.northcape4000.com" target="_blank">Northcape 4000</a> in 2018. He cycled from Lake Garda in northern Italy to the northernmost point of Europe at Northcape in 11 days 10 hours and 43 minutes. It was the following year &#8211; 2019 &#8211; when he embarked on his world record attempt to cycle to Tarifa, which he succeeded in breaking.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I half expected Ian to be gruff and monosyllabic. In her book, Emily Chappell comes across as-hard-as nails and perhaps that was playing on my mind prior to the interview with Ian. How wrong could I have been! He was charm personified and spoke very engagingly and at length about the world of ultra-distance-cycling. Here he is talking about the Northcape 4000 race that he won in 2019:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls="" src="https://cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Ian-Walker-Northcape-4000-1.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"> And here&#8217;s video of him cycling the final day of the race and his arrival at Northcape:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">The audio extract above is just 4 mins of what turned out to be more than an hour of discussion. I edited it last night and cut out very little of what Ian said as it was all so interesting. Ian is a lecturer at the University of Bath and he specialises in environmental psychology. This is how he describes what he does on his own website <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.drianwalker.com" target="_blank">DrIanWalker.com</a>:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">I&#8217;ve purposefully left all the links in that paragraph as I&#8217;m sure many of you will find his research fascinating. My intention had been to ask him more questions about this aspect of his life but in the end the ultra-long-distance cycling came to the fore and I didn&#8217;t want to take up even more of Ian&#8217;s time, but here he is talking about a bit of his work that made it into the newspapers and that I remembered reading about at the time. All in the name of research, he donned a wig of long hair and went off cycling. I had just described it as a &#8216;<em>long, blond wig</em>&#8216;:</p>
