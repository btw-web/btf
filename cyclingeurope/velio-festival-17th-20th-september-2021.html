<p>That&#8217;s about seven festivals in one! Here are the full details:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;From the 17th-20th September 2021, this pioneering festival celebrates life on two wheels for three days and three nights of cycling, music, comedy, feasting, wellness, talks, workshops and immersive activities.</p><p>&#8220;Situated at the stunning Cholmondeley Castle, Cheshire, which is only 45 minutes drive from Manchester and 30 minutes from Chester, Velio provides the ideal opportunity to escape, switch off and unwind, if only for a few days.</p><p>&#8220;By day, saddle up and enjoy five stunning cycle routes with options for beginners, experienced riders, disabled cycling, and mini kids rides. Take it easy on the 3km or 14km routes or go for it on 30km, 60km or 100km.</p><p>&#8220;The highlight of these rides will be the headliner &#8216;Velutopia&#8217;. Stretching across 14km of closed roads, this adrenaline-fuelled event will take cyclists on an immersive tour packed with entertainment and an abundance of surprises along the way-expect weird and wonderful oddities, mid-ride games and tasks, music and celebrations.</p><p>&#8220;Velio offers a multitude of options. The wellness programme curated by Getahead provides the resources to pamper and indulge. Chill out in the hot tubs, do a yoga class, go wild swimming or paddleboarding, or visit the Cuddle Club for some doggy themed therapy.</p><p>&#8220;The indoor cycling centre will appeal to bike buffs who can test out the latest bikes and accessories and experience virtual racing.</p><p>&#8220;Alongside the cycling activities, you can enjoy entertainment, music and comedy in a carefully curated programme of international music artists, comedians and immersive moments across five stages.</p><p>&#8220;Communal feasting will be at the heart of the festival with The Great Village Feast. The award-winning restaurant Volta will be collaborating to produce the banquets at the festival.</p><p>&#8220;Foodies will enjoy long table communal feasts championing the finest local produce, while speciality bars serve up a variety of tempting tipples ranging from wine and gin to craft beers and cocktails.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Included in all tickets is standard camping for three days and three nights with access to a spacious campsite, toilets and showers. Motorhomes and campervans are welcomed, and you can also arrive to pre-erected tents.</p><p>&#8220;With all of the usual festival amenities and more, Velio provides the stuff that cyclists&#8217; dreams are made of, both on and off the saddle. The onsite secure and insured bike storage system will negate any concerns about storing your pride and joy, while the bike cleaning and maintenance stations will make sure your ride is looking tip-top and podium ready. If you don&#8217;t have a bike or don&#8217;t want to bring your own, a bike rental service is available on site. There are also physios and coaches on hand to offer tips and advice and make sure you&#8217;re fully geared up for some cycling fun and frolics.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;In addition to being the first immersive cycling festival, Velio is proud to be the first &#8216;Flexi-Distanced&#8217; festival. All the measures and teams are in place to run the event socially distanced or non socially distanced, whichever the guidelines dictate, so you can book in confidence and have something in the diary to look forward to.</p><p>&#8220;The comprehensive programme of activities and entertainment ensures there is something for all ages and disciplines at Velio, whether you&#8217;re a late-night dancer, an early morning meditator, a weekend feaster or a mid-week rider. Pioneering a community spirit is also paramount at this world-first event, so we&#8217;re calling for you to get out the bike, get out of the city and gear up for an unforgettable weekend of cycle fuelled fun with family and friends, both old and new.&#8221;</p><cite><a href="https://velio.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Velio Festival</a></cite></blockquote>
