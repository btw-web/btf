<h1>Crossing Europe On Trains, Ferries… And A Bike Called Reggie: Part Two</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A heavy-duty bit of research has gone into this post. I hope someone finds it useful&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not so much about the ferries this time (if you want detailed information about taking your bicycle on a ferry <a href="https://cyclingeurope.org/taking-bicycles-on-a-ferry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there&#8217;s some useful advice here</a>), it&#8217;s just the trains. If you read <a href="https://cyclingeurope.org/2018/05/17/crossing-europe-on-trains-ferries-and-a-bike-called-reggie-part-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part one of this mini-series of posts</a> you will remember that back in 2015 when I returned from Nordkapp I was able to take a series of trains and ferries all the way home. It was easy; no fuss, no bother, no prior reservation required. Yet one of my local train companies here in the north of England has, from today, introduced a policy of not allowing bicycles on their trains unless they have been booked on the train 24 hours in advance. For many spontaneous journeys, that can be a real problem. Even for daily commuting cyclists who take the train as part of their journey to work it is a potential issue if they can never guarantee to be on a specific train. And what happens if the train you want to take already has three bicycles booked onto it? That company is Trans Pennine Express. What about the other companies?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, apart from Eurostar (which, admittedly, has more issues to deal with as it crosses international borders), Trans Pennine Trains &#8211; the train company that I use most often when travelling with my bicycle &#8211;  is the only train company in the country that mandates a reservation 24 hours in advance. Ironically, it is my other local train company &#8211; Northern Trains &#8211; that seems to have the most liberated attitude to taking your bike on a train&#8230;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here&#8217;s the detail of what all the train companies say on their websites:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scotrail.co.uk/plan-your-journey/cycling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abellio ScotRail</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re developing a seamlessly integrated cycle and rail network. It&#8217;s our contribution to the Scottish Government vision of 10% of everyday journeys by bike by 2020.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>We&#8217;ve installed more cycle parking at our stations, so it&#8217;s easier to leave your bike securely before catching the train. Or you can take your bike with you. We take bikes free on all our trains, but for some journeys you’ll need to reserve a space in advance.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>There are plenty of reasons to leave the car at home and take the bike instead – keep fit, have fun, and do your bit for the environment. Combining a bike ride with train travel is a brilliant way to see the country – or just to get about town.&#8221;</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;If you are travelling with a bike, please note that we can normally only allow two per train.</em></p>

<li><em>On some Valleys and Cardiff local routes bicycles cannot be taken on trains during peak hours (see our Cycling by Train leaflet below).</em></li>
<li><em>It is strongly recommended that you make your reservation as far in advance as possible (at least 24 hours in advance) and reserve a cycle space at the time of purchasing your ticket. Reservations for bikes are free, please call 03333 211 202 for more information and to make a booking.</em></li>
<li><em>On other services, no reservation is needed. On these services, space is allocated on a first come, first served basis.</em></li>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Northern is strongly committed to promoting cycling as a sustainable and healthy means of transport that complements our train service. Our vision is to &#8216;connect people to opportunities by the most sustainable means&#8217; and cycling has an important role to play.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>We want to do more to make this an attractive option so we are working with local authorities and the cycling community to see where we can make our stations more cycle-friendly.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Bikes are carried free of charge at any time and you don&#8217;t need to make reservations.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The cycle space on trains is clearly marked, both internally and externally. Space is allocated on a first come, first served basis.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>We can only carry a maximum of two bikes per train but conductors have responsibility for the safety of their train and have the right to refuse entry if the train is busy.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Please note: a &#8216;bike&#8217; refers to an unpowered two-wheel cycle &#8211; it excludes tandems, tricycles, power-assisted cycles and trailers.&#8221;</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Whether you’re commuting to work or heading on a cycling holiday, we love to welcome cyclists and their bicycles, but spaces for bikes can become limited at busier times. Safety is important to us, so we do have some restrictions on where and when bikes can be transported on our trains.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Even when there isn’t a restriction we can’t guarantee that your bike will be accepted on the train, as space is allocated on a ‘first come, first served’ basis. Our staff have the right to refuse a bicycle if there is no space for it to be transported safely. Please be considerate of other passengers at all times.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>To avoid delaying trains, make sure you arrive in plenty of time for your train. Station staff can advise you on which of the train doors to use.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>You can take a small folding bicycle on any of our trains, as long as there is space for it to be stowed away safely, where it won’t cause an obstruction.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Bicycle restrictions</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Restrictions apply during peak weekday travel times at stations shown on the <a href="https://www.southwesternrailway.com/~/media/files/on-board/bicycles/bicycle-restriction-map.pdf?la=en">bicycle restrictions map</a>. Bicycles cannot join or leave trains bound for London Waterloo, Reading, Hook, Alton, Guildford and Dorking, due to arrive at London Waterloo between 07:15 and 10:00 inclusive or departing from London Waterloo between 16:45 and 19:00.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Stations between Clapham Junction, Feltham/Strawberry Hill and the Hounslow loop cannot allow bicycles to join or leave trains which are due to leave Clapham Junction between 07:45 and 09:00.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>If you are travelling on our London Waterloo to Salisbury/Exeter/Bristol trains you will need to reserve a space for your bike:</em></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><em>When you book your ticket online</em></li>
<li><em>At any staffed station</em></li>
<li><em>By contacting our <a href="https://www.southwesternrailway.com/contact-and-help/contact-us">Customer Service Centre</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Please book at least 24 hours before you travel.</em></p>
