Neil (from Oxford that is) writes in blue, I respond in black;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Hi Andrew</em></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>I have recently been made redundant and have decided that I am going to take the opportunity to complete a personal challenge.  I live in Oxford and my wife is Italian from Milan, so I have decided to cycle from Oxford to Milan.  I think it is roughly around 1100 miles or so and I have 3 weeks to do it, so I am hoping I will be fine! </em><span style="color:#000000;">Yes, this sounds about enough time to do Oxford to Milan; my own tentative itinerary puts me in Milan at the end of day 20 and Oxford is only half a day away from Reading.</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>I have been researching a route to take and I must explain that I am not a cyclist, I rode a bike as a kid and I have now decided to embark on this challenge and was looking through Google and ended at the Eurovelo 5.  It sounds great but I have been unable to find any detailed information and ended up looking at your website, which appears to have the most information on this route.</em> <em>What I am looking for is a detailed route and wondered if a) there was such a thing and if so where I can get it from and b) if not, some advice about how you have planned the route you are going to take in July. <span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>I must stress, I am a complete novice, so I am looking to find a route that will allow someone like me to go on and provide plenty of places along the way to stop and more importantly a route that isn&#8217;t going to take me on to an autostrada somewhere in France!  The more detail the better.  If it doesn&#8217;t exist then that&#8217;s fine, but any advice on how you planned your route would be most welcome. I&#8217;m not that far away from being a novice myself. </em></span></em><span style="color:#000000;">I&#8217;m not that far away from being a novice myself although I am making good progress! It may sound immodest but this site has become a leading source of information about the route of the Eurovelo 5. However, I have yet to find a definitive route to follow and am increasingly thinking that this is no bad thing. The Eurovelo network will one day no doubt be mapped and even way-marked in all its detail. Some of the routes, for example the <a href="http://www.eurovelo6.org/folder_listing?set_language=en" target="_blank">Eurovelo 6</a> which runs from the French Atlantic Coast to the Black Sea, have already had this treatment and benefit as a result with websites, detailed maps and increased numbers of cyclists as a result. The Eurovelo 5 is still in Cinderella land however. Although initially I did find this a little frustrating, I have grown to like the idea of being a small-time pioneer of the route. There is a very general description which has been written by the <a href="http://www.ecf.com/" target="_blank">ECF</a> (European Cyclists Federation) and which is reprinted on the <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/the-route/" target="_blank">route section</a> of this website. You can see that for much of the route, it piggy-backs upon regional and national cycle networks so, if you are looking for anything that has been pre-routed, this will be your best avenue for research. What I will be doing is really making up my own route but visiting the towns and cities that are mentioned in the Eurovelo description. Much of this will be done in advance (you may have noticed that in <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/2010/04/01/top-10-things-to-do-during-the-easter-holidays/" target="_blank">my list of top ten things to do over my two-week Easter holiday</a> , number 4 is to knuckle down and have a detailed route plan in place), but I will be leaving a certain amount of flexibility in my route that will only be decided when I hit the ground in July. I would like to know where I am going to stay each evening (and the reassurance that there is somewhere to camp each night) and have some idea of the places I will pass en route, but I am happy in my own sense of direction not to have an excessively detailed map in front of me. This will probably mean me using occasional cycle routes but more often B roads or the like. On the <a href="http://www.viamichelin.co.uk/" target="_blank">Via Michelin</a> route website you will notice a button called &#8220;cycling&#8221;. I&#8217;ll be using this over the next couple of weeks quite a lot.</span></span></div>
