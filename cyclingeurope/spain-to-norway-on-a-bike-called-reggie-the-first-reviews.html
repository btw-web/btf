<h1>&#8216;Spain to Norway on a Bike Called Reggie&#8217;: The First Reviews&#8230;</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now back home after my travels to Clitheroe, London, Reading, Oxford, Bath and Bristol over half-term (it was lovely seeing so many of you in Clitheroe, Oxford and Bristol by the way &#8211; thanks for coming to hear me speak &#8211; <a href="https://apsykes.com/speaking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more events coming up in June, July and August</a>&#8230;), it has been nice spending a day or so back home; I&#8217;ve done the washing, and the shopping, I&#8217;ve taken my mother to see a friend in Rochdale, I&#8217;ve changed the tyres on the car and I&#8217;ve even given a cursory thought to going back to school on Monday&#8230; I&#8217;ve also had a good chance to read through the reviews for &#8216;<em><strong><a href="http://summersdale.com/sd-book/spain-to-norway-on-a-bike-called-reggie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spain to Norway on a Bike Called Reggie</a></strong></em>&#8216;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Don&#8217;t believe anyone who says they don&#8217;t read their reviews; of course they do and they can often make or break a film, play, musical or book. The initial positive feedback when I self-published &#8216;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crossing-Europe-Bike-Called-Reggie/dp/1849142130/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1496503056&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Crossing Europe on a Bike Called Reggie</strong></em></a>&#8216; back in 2011 certainly helped make that book the success it subsequently became, encouraged me to write a second volume of travel writing &#8211; &#8216;<em><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Along-Med-Bike-Called-Reggie/dp/1849145059/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1496503188&amp;sr=1-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Along The Med on a Bike Called Reggie</a></strong></em>&#8216; &#8211; and, five years later, was, I&#8217;m sure, influential in giving confidence to the publishers Summersdale to adopt the new book as one of their own. So reviews do matter and they are read!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The production of &#8216;<strong><em>Spain to Norway&#8230;</em></strong>&#8216;, compared to the previous books, was long. This was, of course, for good reasons as the editors got their hands on the manuscript and shaped it into a hopefully much better piece of literary brilliance, perhaps. That takes time. As the weeks and months went on and as I read, changed, added and subtracted words, sentences and paragraphs, it became increasingly difficult for me to give a judgement on the book as I had read it so many times. I knew what was coming next and I had no problem following the thread of the journey as not only had I cycled it, I had also relived it many times over. <em>Was it really any good?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Spain-Norway-Bike-Called-Reggie/dp/1849539901/ref=as_li_ss_il?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=cyclingeorg-21&amp;linkId=2a9678a002c14b045e18b958d70f2e73" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" aligncenter" src="//ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1849539901&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=cyclingeorg-21" border="0" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Well the first reviews are in and I&#8217;m delighted to see that people have enjoyed what they have read. You can read all of the reviews posted to Amazon.co.uk by <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B071R7BMTN/ref=cm_cr_dp_hist_five?ie=UTF8&amp;filterByStar=five_star&amp;reviewerType=all_reviews&amp;showViewpoints=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following this link </a>but of the 9 so far posted, all have judged the book worthy of 5 stars and here are a few highlights of those reviews;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;A very entertaining read. Would highly recommend.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Another cracking read&#8230; Once again Sykes relays the journey in the same easy, informative and humorous style&#8230; a Bryson-like commentary&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;A must for all cycling fans&#8230; <span class="a-size-base review-text">Like Andrew Sykes&#8217; previous books this is no different &#8211; if anything even better. Written in clear prose with a fantastic sense of humour. An excellent travelogue.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;I was not disappointed, in fact it is apparent how much Andrew is improving and maturing as a writer with every volume that emerges&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t put the book down and went through it in one sitting. The humour and writing style drew me along all the way from Tarifa to the Nordkapp&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Excellent travelogue&#8230; If you&#8217;ve read Andrew&#8217;s previous books you won&#8217;t be disappointed.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Proceed with caution you may come out the other side of this book with a serious case of wanderlust. Funny, inspiring and informative.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thanks!</p>
