<h1>Rest Day 5: Novi Vinodolski</h1>
<p>When I normally say &#8216;rest day&#8217; it is no such thing. It&#8217;s a &#8216;day off the bike day&#8217; but today really is a &#8216;rest day&#8217;. I won&#8217;t go into detail but I wasn&#8217;t particularly well yesterday evening. The symptoms were more associated with a bug of some sort however, rather than dehydration. Perhaps I&#8217;m not dehydrated after all. Whatever the cause or symptoms, I do feel better at the moment, certainly compared to last night.<br />
As I said at the end of the previous post, Novi Vinodolski isn&#8217;t the kind of place you would choose to spend 36 hours in on this kind of trip but as a place to recover from sickness, it&#8217;s perfect as there isn&#8217;t really anything to tear me away from my room in this guest house. And what a nice room it is! Think (rather appropriately) private hospital room without the doctors and nurses on hand. Very modern, clinical (in a good sense, i.e. clean), comfortable, air-conditioned. I do have a dodgy picture if an angel about to push two children into a raging torrent on the wall to look at (I&#8217;m sure there are other interpretations &#8211; make your own mind up below) but it is far nicer than Hotel Eva last night. Eleanor &amp; Boris, the owners, were very welcoming but the place needed a bit of an upgrade. I would have been content to stay for another night but, as I suspected after checking availability on Booking.com when I woke this morning, my room was no longer available. Boris to the rescue! He had a friend just down the road who had a room on their house&#8230; &#8220;Does it have a private bathroom?&#8221; I enquired considering how often I had to use the one at Hotel Eva last night. &#8220;Yes, of course&#8230; 50€.&#8221;<br />
The lady who owns the property duly arrived, fully briefed about my medical condition (&#8220;&#8230;idiot from England cycling from Greece to Portugal in this weather&#8230;&#8221;) and after I inspected the place, the deal was sealed. Kelly (the owner) &amp; her sister Sabha from Germany seem to run the place and have shown great kindness with help transporting my things from the hotel, camomile tea, more camomile tea&#8230;<br />
My only trip out so far has been to the supermarket across the road to buy water, factor 50, an isotonic drink (to see what it tastes like &#8211; never had one before) &amp; some bread that I nibbled through for lunch. I may well remain here, horizontal, for the remainder of the day.<br />
Tomorrow, cycling day 21 I will set off for Italy. Trieste is 120km so in theory is an attainable destination. That said, I won&#8217;t be taking risks and if I need to stop earlier, I will. </p>
