<h1>Life In The Yorkshire-Norwegian Media Spotlight</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Earlier this week I received a call from the BBC. Now don&#8217;t get too excited as it wasn&#8217;t (yet) <em>The One Show</em> requesting that I become their cycling-travel expert. Perhaps one day&#8230; It was my friends at BBC Radio Leeds. If you remember, shortly before I set off on my latest transcontinental jaunt in 2015 I was interviewed at length by Martin Kelner on Radio Leeds for his One-on-One slot. You can listen to the complete interview by following this link to the <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/in-the-media/bbc-radio-interview-february-2015/" target="_blank">CyclingEurope iPlayer</a>. (I do hope that you don&#8217;t take all this seriously&#8230;) This week, Radio Leeds wanted me to talk about my favourite tourist destinations and for about five minutes on Wednesday morning, I did just that. If you live in the catchment area for Radio Leeds you may have heard me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps it was this exchange that, when I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn&#8217;t sleep, had me thinking back to my previous encounters with the media. One memorable moment came as a result of me tweeting this back in July 2015 whilst I was cycling through Norway:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Goodness, that caused me all kinds of trouble and I think to this day I am a man who strikes fear into the heart of the Sortland tourist office.</p>

Admittedly, some were sympathetic with what I had tweeted but many were not happy about &#8220;<em>this English writer</em>&#8221; who had come to their town and, effectively, slagged it off in a tweet. Anyway&#8230; Time heals. Let&#8217;s hope so. But last night, in my sleepness state, I Googled a few bits and pieces and discovered that not only had my tweet resulted in many Facebook comments but it had also inspired a group of students to make their own video about Sortland. Now here I come against the brick wall that is the Norwegian language. I can just about hear my name in the first part of the video but as for the rest, it remains very much a mystery. If there are any Norwegian speakers out there I would love to know what they are saying.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I would also love, one day, to return to Sortland and discover that actually, it&#8217;s not the dreary place that I thought it was back on my visit on a wet Sunday afternoon in July last year&#8230; Perhaps they might invite me back.</p>
