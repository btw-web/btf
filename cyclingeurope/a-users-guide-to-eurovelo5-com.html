<h1>A User&#8217;s Guide To eurovelo5.com</h1>
<p>A big thank you to the many people who have been posting comments on this blog. It is a real delight when I send my own posts to the blog to receive the messages that you have been sending either via the blog itself using the &#8220;comments&#8221; button (the best method as your comments can be seen by anyone who visits eurovelo5.com ), via Facebook (where only my &#8220;friends&#8221; can see the comments) or via Twitter.<br />
I&#8217;ve been blogging on the move now for two whole weeks and here is how it works at my end. I&#8217;ve just about figured out a system!<br />
I post to the blog at least three times a day if I can; in the morning, at lunchtime and in the evening. If I end up doing something interesting in the evening I have posted more often. These are written and sent via email on my iPhone and I use the 2MB allowance for which I have paid Orange in the UK £2 per day.<br />
Any incidental thoughts or questions I post to Twitter. These more often than not include a small picture and are also emailed. Even if you don&#8217;t have a Twitter account you can still see these over there on the left of the website. Click on the links for the pictures.<br />
As I said, your comments, whether they be in response to what I have posted or suggestions or ideas or indeed corrections (!) are immensely valued. And if I can I try to reply, via the blog, especially for those of you who don&#8217;t comment very often. You may, however, miss some of my replies if you don&#8217;t go back and check. To make life easier, all you need to do is tick the box when you make your initial comment and you will be emailed if any follow-up comments are made by me or others. You may also see my reply over there on the left in the list of most recent comments.<br />
My posts on the blog are automatically posted to my Facebook account as well but as I said, comments made on Facebook are only seen by the limited people who have access to my Facebook account rather than eurovelo5.com which is a free for all!<br />
Signals via the SPOT tracker are sent every 10 minutes when I am on the move; I try to remember to pause the signals if I stop for more than 10 minutes. You are able to see the 50 most recent tracks by clicking on the little map at the top left of this page to see where I am.<br />
I continue to check my email via the iPhone and of course text messages (but these are pricey to reply to!).<br />
Hope that all makes sense and thank you all for you visits, comments, suggestions and ideas. Every single one is a delight to receive!<br />
PS: Thanks to all of you who have donated to the charity via <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/ev5" rel="nofollow">http://www.justgiving.com/ev5</a> . I&#8217;m up to 69% of my target thanks to the most recent donation by Ron &amp; Bea in Spain. I was thinking today that next year I could head in your direction&#8230; 🙂</p>
