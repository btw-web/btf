<h1>Cádiz: Fifty Shades Of Grey Sky And Enchufe</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The title might have persuaded you not to bother reading this but for those of you still here&#8230; It&#8217;s not been a great day. Nothing bad has happened. I haven&#8217;t been thrown onto the streets of Cádiz or expelled from the language school or anything like that. It&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve been in a miserable mood. I wonder if this had anything to do with the weather. Since artiving in southern Spain nearly three weeks ago it has been almost constant blue skies, there hasn&#8217;t been a drop of rain and temperatures have been consistently in the low 20s (probably much higher at times). Today&#8217;s sudden reversion to a grey sky, occasional rain and a temperature probably only half of what it has been is a (cruel?) reality check that even in this most southerly point of the continent, a day in mid March can be just as lousy as elsewhere. The forecast for the rest of the week isn&#8217;t looking brilliant. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My enthusiasm at the language school this morning was lacking and I did the minimum; sufficient not to arouse the suspicion of my teachers that I wasn&#8217;t making an effort but internally I was struggling with motivation and much effort was expended in clock watching. As soon as the final class finished at 2pm I was back &#8216;home&#8217; at the flat preparing for a siesta. Well, I ate a quick lunch and then positioned myself horizontally on the bed and idled away some time in Twitter. It didn&#8217;t involve sleep which, I assume, is a key ingredient of a proper siesta but it was as close as I could get.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I eventually summoned up a modicum of enthusiasm, gathered my things together and headed out onto the streets in search of a bar that I visited last Thursday on the &#8216;tapas night&#8217;. After around 90 minutes of trudging around Cádiz, I couldn&#8217;t find it, so I gave up and found a rather uninspiring place in which to write this and catch up on a few emails. At least it&#8217;s conveniently close to the Carrefour supermarket which is my ultimate destination for the evening. En route I took a picture of this door.  More positive news after the door:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" title="" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img_1700.jpg?resize=480%2C802&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="480" height="802" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has been one minor success today however. If you remember, on Saturday I made a visit to Tarifa, the starting point of the cycle across the continent to Nordkapp only to discover that the Guardia Civil have taken occupation of the peninsula (erroneously called the <i>Isla de las Palomas</i> as it is most definitely attached to the mainland) and in so doing have put a spanner in the works of my plan to cycle from the most southerly point of Europe to the most northerly one. This morning I called the tourist office in Tarifa and a very nice lady explained that there would be an organised guided visit of the island (which is really a peninsula) but that it would be on Friday 10th April. My plan is to set off from Tarifa on Thursday 9th April. Should I delay my departure by 24 hours? Perhaps. The tourist office did give me however the email address of the Guardia Civil in Tarifa and I&#8217;m holding out hope that they may allow me onto the &#8216;Island&#8217; on the Thursday. There can&#8217;t be that many people who write books about cycling from one end of the continent to another, can there? It&#8217;s worth a punt at the very least. If you are reading this and know someone high up in the Spanish establishment who might be able to help me with a bit of &#8216;<i>enchufe</i>&#8216; (the Spanish word for making the most of people in authority to make your life a bit easier), do get in touch.</p>
