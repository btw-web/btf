<h1>Planning From Tirana To Dubrovnik</h1>
<p>So&#8230; The next couple of countries are coming up fast; Montenegro &amp; Croatia. Today is Monday 15th and the plan is:<br />
<strong>Tuesday 16th &#8211; Tirana to Ulcinj (Montenegro)</strong><br />
This might be a long day in the saddle but I have just had a decent rest here in Tirana. I&#8217;m meeting a contact at the British Council for a chat over coffee at 9am on Tuesday so this will delay my departure from the capital slightly (but I&#8217;m looking forward to speaking to someone about the Albania of 2013 so I&#8217;m not willing to change this!) but I will be sticking to the main roads between the capital and the border so that should hopefully speed me on my way. There are two potential issues that I may have. Firstly if those pesky sign makers have classified any of the roads between here and the border as motorways (green signs &#8211; see earlier post for my comments on these) I will have to deviate slightly from the direct route. Secondly, mountains! From what I can see on Google maps the route should be relatively flat although I do expect some climbing towards the city of Shkodra and the border slightly further to the west. The Albanian Alps (the clue is in the name!) don&#8217;t seem to kick in until you are east of Shkodra. I hope&#8230; Once I cross the border into Montenegro near a small town called Sukobin (where there is a hotel should I need it), I&#8217;m hoping to have time to continue to the coast to a town called Ulcinj where there is at least one campsite. Monica Piercy who cycled a similar route to mine earlier in the year stayed here and recommends it (especially the ice cream!).<br />
<strong>Wednesday 17th &#8211; Ulcinj to Tivat</strong><br />
This is where it gets really technical. The dimensions of a mini iPad are 20cm by 13.5cm. The distance as the crow flies between Ulcinj and Dubrovnik is two lengths of a mini iPad. So that&#8217;s 40cm. My map is 1:300,000 so 1cm = 3km which makes the direct distance between the two towns 120km. My route won&#8217;t be direct, it will have plenty of wiggle so let&#8217;s add 50% to that which makes 180km. Two days cycling of around 90km? Tivat is one mini iPad from each town and has campsites so I&#8217;ll aim for that for Wednesday night. It&#8217;s a good job they didn&#8217;t have me working on the moon landings&#8230; Twitter contact Aleksandar Jahaj lives in the town of Bar and I&#8217;m hopefully going to meet up with him. He has also confirmed that there is a campsite in Ulcinj (just in case Monica was dreaming) and its called Velika Plaza. He also notes that there is a campsite further along the coast from Bar called Maljevik. I will however probably need to press on to Tivat. This may change&#8230;<br />
<strong>Thursday 18th &#8211; Tivat to Dubrovnik</strong><br />
Continuing along the coast. Nothing complicated here I hope. As I will be taking another day off (yes, another one!) in Dubrovnik I&#8217;ll probably be in a hotel again although if anyone wants to suggest a good campsite that is close to the city centre, please do.<br />
<strong>Friday 19th &#8211; Rest day in Dubrovnik</strong><br />
I have a journalist contact in Dubrovnik and hopefully I&#8217;ll be meeting up with him for a coffee.<br />
That&#8217;s the plan. Thought, comments, criticisms welcome. They may be welcomed or indeed ignored but they will at least be read.</p>
