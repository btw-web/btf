<h1>Where There&#8217;s A Will: Brutal, Sweaty, Dirty, Visceral, Painful&#8230; And Recommended</h1>

<p class="has-text-color has-background has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify has-very-light-gray-color has-vivid-red-background-color">I&#8217;ll be honest. Since writing my own books about long-distance cycling, I have steered clear of other books about long-distance cycling. That&#8217;s certainly an error on my part as there are, without doubt, some great books out there. The reason I shy away from diving into new books by Mark Beaumont, Tim Moore and the like is that I don&#8217;t want to spend my time comparing their style and quality with my own style and quality. I&#8217;m terrified, frankly, that I might not fare well. My current pile of reading is skewed towards the theme of Japan &#8211; <strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Hokkaido Highway Blues (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/37axovW" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hokkaido Highway Blues</span></a></em></strong> being top of that list &#8211; with one or two other books thrown in for good measure. <strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Seashaken Houses (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/37aZreB" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seashaken Houses</span></a></em></strong>, for example, that I bought on the ferry back from northern Spain in September. (It&#8217;s about lighthouses should you be interested.)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Occasionally I am sent a book to review by publishers. I&#8217;m happy to feature them on CyclingEurope.org and on social media but rarely read them. I don&#8217;t pass judgement as to their quality but am willing to publish an extract if one is available. This is what happened when Profile Books sent me a book by Emily Chappell called <strong><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Where There's A Will (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/3566fby" target="_blank">Where There&#8217;s A Will</a></em></strong>:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">But then, last weekend, I picked up the book and started to read. By the time I had finished the first chapter, I was gripped and, come Monday evening, I had read the book from cover to cover. It&#8217;s worth noting that I have been reading <em>Seashaken Houses</em> for over two months and <em>Hokkaido Highway Blues</em> since the spring. (It&#8217;s also worth noting that <em>The Rough Guide to Japan</em> and <em>Be More Japan</em> are also competing for my reading time. As is the latest issue of <em>Private Eye</em>&#8230;)</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;In 2015 Emily Chappell embarked on a formidable new bike race: The Transcontinental. 4,000km across Europe, unassisted, in the shortest time possible.</em></p><p><em>On her first attempt she made it only halfway, waking up suddenly on her back in a field, floored by the physical and mental exertion.</em></p><p><em>A year later she entered the race again &#8211; and won.</em></p><p><em>Where There&#8217;s a Will takes us into Emily Chappell&#8217;s race, grinding up mountain passes and charging down the other side; snatching twenty minutes&#8217; sleep on the outskirts of a village before jumping back on the bike to surge ahead for another day; feeding in bursts and navigating on the go. We experience the crippling self-doubt of the ultra distance racer, the confusing intensity of winning and the desperation of losing a dear friend who understood all of this.&#8221;</em></p><cite>The blurb&#8230;</cite></blockquote>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide"/>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Clearly Emily&#8217;s style of long-distance cycling is world away from my own. If you are looking for a leisurely jaunt that meanders from one small town to the next with a few big cities thrown in for good measure, you&#8217;ll be disappointed. This is brutal stuff. It&#8217;s uncomfortable, sweaty, dirty, visceral. It&#8217;s also, in places, painful &#8211; both physically and emotionally &#8211; and no glossy advert for the experience of embarking upon a race such as <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Transcontinental (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.transcontinental.cc/" target="_blank">The Transcontinental</a></em>. Unless, that is, brutal, uncomfortable, sweaty, dirty, visceral and painful cycling is your thing. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Fortunately for the reader, it <em>is</em> Emily Chappell&#8217;s thing and she has conjured up a memorable and riveting account of her life as she attempts, fails, attempts again and finally succeeds in her ambition to be the fastest woman to cross the European continent in <em>The Transcontinental</em> race. Her determination is admirable, but so is her willingness to open up to the reader about her emotional fragility. No more so than when her good friend and fellow long-distance cyclist <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Mike Hall is killed during a race across Australia in 2017 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/31/british-cyclist-mike-hall-killed-during-race-in-australia" target="_blank">Mike Hall is killed during a race across Australia in 2017</a>. Indeed if you are not aware of what is to come, you may wonder what can possibly fill the final third of the book after she triumphs in <em>The Transcontinental</em>. It&#8217;s a testament to the quality of Chappell&#8217;s writing that she is able to provide a compelling tale even after the narrative of the main race is set aside.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As a result of reading the book, I won&#8217;t be signing up for <em>The Transcontinental</em> anytime soon (although I dare say some might be tempted). I will, however, make a point of complaining a little less when it&#8217;s cold and wet outside and I happen to find myself cycling up a long hill in the dark.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;There are a lot of parallels between writing a book and cycling across a continent. Both are difficult, interminable , and yet immensely rewarding.&#8221;</em></p><cite>Emily Chappell, Where There&#8217;s A Will</cite></blockquote>
