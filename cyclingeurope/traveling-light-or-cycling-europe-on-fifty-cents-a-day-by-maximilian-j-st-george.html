<h1>&#8220;Traveling Light Or Cycling Europe On Fifty Cents A Day&#8221; By Maximilian J. St. George</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was emailed yesterday by a guy in America called Angelo who is planning his own cycle tour of Europe. He had read <a href="http://amzn.to/2jDtyXz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong>Crossing Europe on a Bike Called Reggie</strong></em></a> and suggested that I might be interested in another book that predates my own by getting on for nearly a century;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><em>&#8220;My strongest inspiration is a favorite old book, copyright 1922.  The title is <strong>Traveling Light or Cycling Europe on Fifty Cents a Day</strong>.  The author, Maximilian J. St George, was a young American, recently graduated from Law School at Notre Dame, in Indiana. Before embarking on his career, he went off on a 16 month cycling tour of Europe.  This was around 1920.  Total mileage was 16,300 miles (25,920 km).  He traveled with little kit &#8211; a blanket; a rain cape; a change of clothes; shaving kit; tire/tube repair.  The  cape and blanket were strapped to a rear carrier and the rest in a 288  knapsack hung on his handlebars. Far less than what kit that you or I carry on tour!  The condition he placed upon himself was that he would not stay in any hotels, rather that he would ask locals if he  stay in a barn or some form of shelter.  He wanted to meet the people of Europe vis-a-vis. Often he was invited to stay in their home.  He worked his passage from Boston to London aboard the Anglican, a cattle ship.  From there, he cycled to Dover, crossed the Channel to Ostend, Belgium and northward to Scandinavia; Southwest to Austria; west through Switzerland, Alsace-Lorrain, on to Bonn, then France and Spain, then the Riviera, Italy. St. George then rode an arc north and west back to England.  Quite a tour, I say!  He passed through every European capital except Lisbon and Petrograd .&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What an adventure and what a fascinating time to complete to an adventure in the optimism of 1920s post-war Europe. I can&#8217;t find out any more details about Maximilian&#8217;s cycling travels across Europe other than those provided by Angelo. <a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-27-at-11-38-17.png"><img data-attachment-id="9808" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2013/05/27/traveling-light-or-cycling-europe-on-fifty-cents-a-day-by-maximilian-j-st-george/screen-shot-2013-05-27-at-11-38-17/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-27-at-11-38-17.png?fit=338%2C75&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="338,75" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2013-05-27 at 11.38.17" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-27-at-11-38-17.png?fit=300%2C67&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-27-at-11-38-17.png?fit=338%2C75&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-9808" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-27-at-11-38-17.png?resize=270%2C60" alt="Screen Shot 2013-05-27 at 11.38.17" width="270" height="60" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>He was born in 1885 and when he did return to America he became a Chicago attorney who made a name for himself in <a href="http://iamthewitness.com/doc/A.Mockery.of.Justice-The.Great.Sedition.Trial.of.1944.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Great Sedition Trial of 1944</em></a>. He wrote about that experience too in a book called <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/trial-The-great-sedition-1944/dp/B0007ILW7K/ref=sr_1_cc_3?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369651776&amp;sr=1-3-catcorr&amp;keywords=A+Trial+on+Trial%3A+The+Great+Sedition+Trial+of+1944" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Trial on Trial: The Great Sedition Trial of 1944</a>. </i>His book about cycling around Europe appears to be unavailable but if anyone has heard of it, read it or even knows more about the intriguing Mr St. George, I&#8217;d be interested in hearing from you.</p>
