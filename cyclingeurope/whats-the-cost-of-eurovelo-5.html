<h1>What&#8217;s The Cost Of Eurovelo 5?</h1>

<div style="text-align:justify;">Apologies for the delay in replying to your email&#8230; No excuses!</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">It sounds to me as if you already have most of the things that will in any way be expensive like the bike &amp; tent. Over the course of the five weeks that it took me to cycle from the UK (Reading) to Brindisi, I spent about half of the nights in my tent, about a quarter of the time with people who I knew or who had contacted me via the website and offered accommodation and the remaining quarter in hotels. Obviously staying with people is the cheapest option (although I was most likely to go out for a proper meal on those nights and would offer to pay for the person or people I was staying with so you could argue that it actually wasn’t that cheap), then comes the campsites and then hotels. Campsites were pretty good value all the way. The minimum I paid for a night was at the municipal campsite in Metz where I only had to pay about 6 euros. Switzerland was a little more expensive – perhaps 15-20 euros (no point changing any money btw to Swiss francs as everywhere accepts the euro) – and the prices stayed in that price range down through Italy. The campsites near the coast in Italy can (so I’ve heard) be very expensive but the route I took was mainly inland apart from the bit just north of Pisa. I could have done the whole thing under canvas if I’d planned a bit better in advance and found out where the campsites were. I stayed in (cheapish) hotels when I was in a bit town / city – Luxembourg, Strasbourg, Como &amp; Matera – and wanted to be central. So, missing out the hotels, I reckon you should budget on average for about 15-20 euros per night for a campsites (a few will be cheaper, a few more expensive). Food can be as cheap or as expensive as you decide I suppose. Buying bread, cheese etc.. from a supermarket won’t set you back too much; perhaps another 10 euros per day for food. Other costs were having the bike repaired – I had problems with my spokes – and I paid probably about 150 euros in total for repairs. And another cost was Wi-Fi access. I wanted to update the blog on a daily basis and Wi-Fi via my iPhone was the best and cheapest way of doing it. Most campsites and hotels had Wi-Fi but most charged; budget around 3-5 euros for that if you plan on doing something similar. So adding all that up, I reckon if you budget on 40 euros per day you would be able to make the journey easily. Others will have done it on a shoestring (wild camping etc&#8230;), others in luxury (staying in good quality hotels etc&#8230;). My journey was a half-way house I suppose but with a bit of better planning regarding the campsites I think I would be able to do it more cheaply if I were to do it again.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Good luck and let me know how you get on!</div>
