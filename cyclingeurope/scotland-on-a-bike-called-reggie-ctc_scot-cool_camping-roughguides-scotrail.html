It&#8217;s not another book, and it won&#8217;t be (unless someone calls with an offer I can&#8217;t refuse) but it does sum up my plan for August 2014 in terms of cycling. This afternoon I bought a ticket for the overnight sleeper train from London Euston to Inverness for Monday evening and an onward ticket to Thurso for Tuesday morning. Basically, my plan is to cycle first along the northern coast of Scotland (I would love to make it to the very corner at Cape Wrath following in the footsteps of Nicholas Crane who was there recently for the Coast programme) before heading south along the west coast of Scotland with a provisional destination of Fort William. According to the excellent <a href="http://www.coolcamping.co.uk/" target="_blank">Cool Camping Scotland</a> book that I purchased this afternoon, the west coast is riddled with good campsites and it is my firm intention not to resort to using <a href="http://Booking.com" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> and to make sure that as many of the ten nights as possible between the 12th and 21st August are under canvas. Or whatever material my tent is made of&#8230; I need to be in Penrith in Cumbria for a family celebration on Friday 22nd August and after that weekend, I could continue for a few more days through the Yorkshire Dales I suppose. I&#8217;ll see how I feel&#8230; And how Reggie feels. He is currently at his makers, well, <a href="http://www.awcycles.co.uk/" target="_blank">his distributors</a> for a minor check-up and I have <a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/tubus-ergo-lowrider-front-rack/" target="_blank">new front pannier racks on order from Wiggle</a>. <a href="http://www.roughguides.com/shop/rough-guide-scottish-highlands-islands/#" target="_blank">The Rough Guide to the Scottish Highlands and Islands</a> is purchased, as is <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/shop/road-street-map-scotland.html" target="_blank">the Ordnance Survey map</a>. One thing that I need to decide between now and my arrival in Fort William is as to whether I use the opportunity of being in the vicinity to climb Britain&#8217;s highest mountain, Ben Nevis. I&#8217;ll make sure I pack my walking books. As for the clothing that I might need for that particular vertical excursion, it may be very similar to the clothing that I will probably require for the horizontal one along the coast; Tropical Storm Bertha is, apparently, approaching&#8230; I will post daily updates to <a href="http://CyclingEurope.org" target="_blank">CyclingEurope.org</a> of course along with a whole host of hopefully stunning photographs. It will give you something to read in between chapters of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Along-Med-Bike-Called-Reggie-ebook/dp/B00M783KDW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407349775&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank"><em><strong>Along The Med on a Bike Called Reggie</strong></em></a>&#8230; Advice as to where I should go, what I should seek out and where I should stay is, as always, much appreciated.</p>
