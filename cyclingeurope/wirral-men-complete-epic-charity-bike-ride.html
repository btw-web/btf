<p>5 COUNTRIES &#8211; 10 DAYS &#8211; 1315 KILOMETRES &#8211; £3600 RAISED FOR CHARITY&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img_3826.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img_3826.jpg?resize=640%2C480&#038;ssl=1" title="" class="size-large" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this year we told you about a group of young men from Wirral who were planning to undertake an epic and unsupported bike ride from London to Berlin to raise funds for Cancer Research UK and Dementia UK.</p>
<p>The three lads Simon Tilsley, Shaun Park and Adam Woods set off from their Wirral homes at the beginning of the month and started their challenge in the centre of London on Saturday the 2nd of May.</p>
<p>“We all trained hard for the ride and I’m glad that we did; it was much tougher than I’d expected, especially some of the later days which included a lot of difficult climbs.” Adam Woods 21.</p>
<p>Over the next ten days, the lads travelled through Southern England, France, Belgium, Holland and Germany to reach their end goal at the Brandenburg Gate in the Centre of Berlin. To keep costs to a minimum, the trip was unsupported, meaning that the three riders had to carry all of their clothing, spare parts and other supplies while averaging 130 kilometres every day.</p>
<p>“The support from family, friends and colleagues has meant a huge amount to us. Knowing how much we were raising for our charities really kept us going when conditions were tough.” Shaun Park 23.</p>
<p>Recovering at home, among families, friends and a mass of supporters, the lads were already talking about how they can continue their charity work and push themselves to greater challenges.</p>
<p>“I’m really not sure yet how we are going to better this year’s project, but I can promise you that we’ll continue to do our very best to support the charities that mean so much to us.” Simon Tilsley 22.</p>
<p>You can still donate online at <a href="http://www.londontoberlin.co.uk">www.londontoberlin.co.uk </a></p>
<p>All costs of undertaking the trip were met by the lads from their own pockets, which means that every penny raised goes directly to the charities.</p>
