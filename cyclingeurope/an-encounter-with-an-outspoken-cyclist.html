<h1>An Encounter With An Outspoken Cyclist</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify;" class="has-text-color has-background has-drop-cap has-very-light-gray-color has-vivid-red-background-color">I&#8217;m not so outspoken although the ridiculous shooting-yourself-in-the-foot nonsense that is Brexit gets my blood boiling and my current issues with Vodafone have me using creative language that would shock your grandmother, and then there&#8217;s the idiots who park on cycle lanes* and the pavement &#8211; often both&#8230; Let&#8217;s start again. I&#8217;m not <em>usually</em> outspoken. But this week I had a chat with the self-proclaimed &#8216;outspoken cyclist&#8217; of North America, Diane Jenks. She hosts a long-running podcast called <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Outspoken Cyclist (opens in a new tab)" href="https://outspokencyclist.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Outspoken Cyclist</em></a></span></strong> and in this week&#8217;s programme, I am one of her guests. You can listen to the whole episode below, but before we get to that bit, listen to this:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Wow! <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Cycling Europe Podcast (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cyclingeurope.org/podcast/" target="_blank">The Cycling Europe Podcast</a></strong> needs a jingle like that! Anyway&#8230; Diane was a delight and we chatted over the course of about 40 minutes about the long rides, the bikes, the books, the website, the podcast&#8230; My part of the podcast starts at 22 minutes but don&#8217;t just listen to me, have a listen to the first part of the podcast as well where Diane interviews John Stacks from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the Specialized Foundation (opens in a new tab)" href="https://outridebike.org/" target="_blank">the Specialized Foundation</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;My first guest is Jon Stacks, the STEM and science liaison for the Specialized Foundation.</em></p><p><em>Founded by Specialized’s Mike Sinyard, the organization was founded to bring cycling to middle school children – especially those suffering from ADHD.</em></p><p><em>Jon, who comes from a science background, will fill us in on what current research is telling us about the effects that riding a bicycle have on children, especially those diagnosed with ADHD and other similar issues. These findings came as nothing new to Mike Sinyard as he experienced the effects of ADHD pretty much his entire life and then saw them arise in his son Anthony.</em></p><p><em>Recently, the foundation has undergone a rebranding – now being called Outride.org. – and Jon will tell us why and what the hopes are for the future.</em></p><p><em>Then, we’ll take a trip across the pond to talk with long distance cyclist Andrew P. Sykes. Back in 2010, Andrew was a French teacher with a summer break ahead of him and decided to take a bike trip with Reggie, the name he gave his Ridgeback bicycle.</em></p><p><em>That first trip and some encouragement he received from someone who was vicariously following along while awaiting the birth of her daughter by reading his blog each day, has since turned into three trips, three books, a blog, a podcast, videos, speaking engagements, and … listen in for a great conversation!&#8221;</em></p><cite>Diane Jenks, <a href="https://outspokencyclist.com/2019/08/show-464-august-3-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OutspokenCyclist.com (opens in a new tab)">OutspokenCyclist.com</a> </cite></blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">*I&#8217;ve been at it again&#8230; This was en route to work today. Perhaps I am an outspoken cyclist after all.</p>
