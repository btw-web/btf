I have inspired someone. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>We would have to probably buy used bikes in Europe and sell them when we left; would this be difficult?  <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>OK. The buying of the bike bit is easy 🙂 The selling less so. I suppose if you were hanging around in Italy for a few days and made contact with potential buyers either through the Internet or people you meet then selling them on might be a possibility. </em></span>We were thinking of maybe starting in Brussels, and working our way down to Rome along your route. Do you have mapped out specifically what roads you are going to go on? Because we have such short time, I thought the only way it may happen is if we follow your itinerary/route and take advantage of all of the meticulous leg work you have done. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>I&#8217;m honored that you have chosen my route but I can&#8217;t stress how much of a work-in-progress it actually is and lacks the detail on the level of knowing which roads I will take from town to town. I personally don&#8217;t mind this; I&#8217;m happy pouring over a map for a good half an hour or so over a drink the </em><em>night before the &#8220;stage&#8221; and figuring out in more detail. You overstate the amount of work I have actually put into the route itself by using words such as &#8220;meticulous&#8221;! </em></span> We want to enjoy this though, is it a pretty grueling ride? <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>It shouldn&#8217;t be too grueling a ride apart from some of the days in the Alps when the climbs will be relentless. Northern Europe is more undulating than Alpine and following the Rhine along the Franco-German border is probably going to be a fairly flat route. </em></span>How is the scenery?<span style="color:#ff0000;"> Bloody marvelous!</span> How are the roads?</em></span> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>The roads should be good to excellent, especially in Switzerland where everything is done &#8220;properly&#8221; (not the case in the UK or in Italy!) </em></span><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Is this feasible&#8230;. in such little time?<span style="color:#ff0000;"> I reckon you have plenty of time to complete the cycle &#8211; I&#8217;m aiming to do London to Brindisi in five weeks so you should have plenty of time to do Brussels to Rome</span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Another concern is we only speak English and a little Spanish.  Will finding our way be a problem? <span style="color:#ff0000;">No problem whatsoever &#8211; the key thing with the language aspect of things is to have a go and learning a few words of French, German and Italian will reap enormous dividends when it comes to asking directions or dealing with the everyday things in life. If you can show that you are making an effort to hold out a linguistic olive branch, it is usually reciprocated! </span></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Thank you for looking over this crazy e-mail and for putting together such a great and helpful website.<span style="color:#ff0000;"> Thank you for reading it!</span></em></span></p>
