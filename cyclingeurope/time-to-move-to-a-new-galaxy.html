<h1>Time To Move To A New Galaxy?</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I first embarked on a long(ish)-distance cycle back in 2009 cycling along the <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/pennine-cycleway-2009/" target="_blank">Pennine Cycleway</a> from Berwick-upon-Tweed to Derby I took with me a pre-smart phone. I think it was a Nokia. It did a pretty good job allowing me to take some half-decent pictures and send them to this blog with a bit of text to explain where I was. Fast forward twelve months to summer 2010 and I embarked upon <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/eurovelo-5-2010-2/" target="_blank">my first continental crossing by bike</a> with a much smarter iPhone 4. I had to be careful with the data but it served me very well indeed and I tapped out an astonishing 30,000 words on the screen&#8217;s keyboard during the five weeks of the trip. It also allowed some high quality picture-taking including the one that ended up on the front cover of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Crossing-Europe-Called-Reggie-ebook/dp/B009YYZLDY/" target="_blank">Crossing Europe on a Bike Called Reggie</a>. Move forward another three years to 2013 when I set off once again to <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/the-next-adventure-201/" target="_blank">cross the continent by bike</a> and I had upgraded to an iPhone 5 supplemented by a mini iPad and a package from Vodafone allowing me to use data pretty much as I use it back here in the UK. Could things have been any better? Well yes, they probably could&#8230; Although the old Nokia had its limitations it was  durable little phone. It would have probably survived a few drops on the floor but that said, rain would have been an issue. The iPhone in contrast was all singing and dancing on a technological level but one slip of the hand could (and once did) lead to it smashing into pieces. During both European trips I had to be very careful with the Apple technology; it was a bit like cycling across Europe with a piece of glass in my pocket. If only someone could make a smart phone that had the technological prowess of the iPhone with the durability of a waterproof brick&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Well, perhaps my prayers have been answered. A couple of weeks ago I was sent a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/mobile-devices/smartphones/android/GT-I9295ZAABTU/?cid=uk_ppc_googleuk_SamsungGalaxyActiveBroad-samsunggalaxyfamily_pro_20130620" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S4 Active</a> to review. It&#8217;s a standard Samsung Galaxy S4 (although the word &#8216;standard&#8217; seems a little harsh as the phone itself has some impressive features that outdo the iPhone 5 such as a much larger screen &amp; a significantly more versatile camera) that&#8217;s had some major pimping for the &#8216;active&#8217; market, hence the name. If I drop my iPhone onto a hard surface it&#8217;s as good as destroyed. That&#8217;s not the case with the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active. Although I haven&#8217;t tested it to the point of destruction, I have dropped it a few times (on purpose) and it&#8217;s still in once piece and fully-functioning, even after a collision with a hard surface. It&#8217;s also waterproof (for up to 30 minutes at 1 metre apparently). Now it&#8217;s been uncharacteristically dry in Berkshire over the last few days so I had to resort to dunking the phone in the bath and again, it has survived the experience! The camera even has a special &#8216;aqua&#8217; function for shooting underwater. I did this in the shower but I&#8217;m afraid that particular video remains classified. It also has an &#8216;air gesture&#8217; feature that allows the device to be operated (to a certain extent) while wearing a thick pair of gloves for example &#8211; quite cool!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have to be honest and say that I&#8217;m quite loyal to my iPhone but having had a go with the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active I&#8217;m beginning to wonder whether my loyalty is in conflict with me using a piece of kit that gives me exactly what I&#8217;m looking for; a very smart smartphone that has been specifically designed to cope in a more challenging environment. When upgrade time arrives in summer 2014 I&#8217;ve got a difficult choice to make!</p>
