<h1>Cycle from Reading to London</h1>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/p1000577.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/p1000577.jpg?w=890" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Was it the fact that Britain won its first Olympic Gold in Beijing in cycling or was it my good mood (see earlier post). I decided to cycle to London via Windsor and then catch the train back from Paddington. I did all that &#8211; it took about four hours but without the detour when I lost my way just before I arrved in Bray and by following the actual National Cycle Route 4 which seemed to disappear in Windsor (or was it my own error in wanting to cycle past the castle &#8211; you can&#8217;t go to Windsor without doing so), I reckon I could have done the ride in three hours. Following the main routes &#8211; A4 via Windsor &#8211; the AA say it is about 43 miles from Reading to Central London. The route I took (including the &#8220;detours&#8221;) must be 50 miles. That&#8217;s about 70 kilometres. It is a very rough 2,500 kilometres from Reading to Brindisi so if I were to average 100 kilometres per day (about 50% more on top of what I did today) &#8211; or about 5 hours minimum cycling per day, I would be able to get to Southern Italy in just over three weeks. I have given myself the month of August to do so. I think it is definitely doable. To prove that I did get to Trafalger Square I took the picture above of a rainbow over South Africa House. It threw it down just as I arrived in central London. None of that is proof that I did cycle down there of course. A photo wouldn&#8217;t stand up in court. My exercised limbs would be persuasive to a sympathetic judge.<br />I got back to Reading by train and the lodger had arrived back from his three-week visit to the west coast of America &#8211; one week work and two-weeks of holiday. He too intimated that I had put weight on although not in such a direct way that my female friend in London on Friday&#8230;</p>
