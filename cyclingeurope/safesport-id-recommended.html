<h1>Safesport ID: Recommended!</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A couple of months ago I wrote about some cycling clothing that I had been sent by Aldi (&#8220;<a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/2013/09/27/cycling-gear-from-err-aldi-aldiuk/" target="_blank">Cycling Gear From&#8230; Err&#8230; Aldi</a>&#8220;). Despite my scepticism about the quality of anything that comes from the budget supermarket, I was very impressed (and continue to be so; the £4.99 waterproof gloves were invaluable when hiking last weekend in the Lake District; it didn&#8217;t seem to stop raining in the three days I spent in Cumbria but my hands remained perfectly dry). Shortly after the delivery from Aldi, I was contacted by a company called <a href="http://www.safesportid.com/en/" target="_blank">Safesport id</a>. <a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/screen-shot-2013-11-03-at-12-30-04.png"><img data-attachment-id="43016" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2013/11/03/safesport-id-recommended/screen-shot-2013-11-03-at-12-30-04/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/screen-shot-2013-11-03-at-12-30-04.png?fit=324%2C250&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="324,250" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2013-11-03 at 12.30.04" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/screen-shot-2013-11-03-at-12-30-04.png?fit=300%2C231&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/screen-shot-2013-11-03-at-12-30-04.png?fit=324%2C250&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-43016" alt="Screen Shot 2013-11-03 at 12.30.04" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/screen-shot-2013-11-03-at-12-30-04.png?resize=194%2C150" width="194" height="150" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Would I be interested in trying out one of their identity bracelets? &#8216;No problem&#8217; I said and I was invited to fill out a few details online before the bracelet was dispatched. It&#8217;s nothing more than a rubber bracelet but it does have a metal plate attached to it with some key personal information about me and who to contact should I fall off my bike and be left unconscious etc&#8230; Just as with the clothing from Aldi, I cannot find fault with the product that <a href="http://www.safesportid.com/en/" target="_blank">Safesport id</a> are selling. It&#8217;s not just for long-distance pan-European cycling adventures of course; I&#8217;ve been wearing mine for the last week or so as I went hiking in the English Lake District last weekend and have also started to get back into my running. I even wore it to the swimming pool this morning. It&#8217;s practical but also quite stylish. I&#8217;ll obviously continue wearing it when I return to the dangerous world of secondary school teaching tomorrow morning&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Please note</strong></span>: I don&#8217;t often receive freebies but when I do I&#8217;m more than happy to recommend them if I think they are any good. If they aren&#8217;t, I just stay silent. CyclingEurope.org isn&#8217;t a comparison website (there are plenty of these on the Internet) but if someone is willing to provide me with something and I like it, credit where credit is due; I&#8217;m happy to push a little publicity in their direction!</p>
