<h1>An Early Morning Confession</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hate to admit this but until yesterday afternoon I hadn&#8217;t been out on my bike for a month. Yes, a whole month. Sorry. I do have a few excuses&#8230; The last week of the academic year in mid July is always an eclectic mix of methods of transport due to changed timetables, late mornings &amp; social events after school. This year, to add to the usual change of routine, one of Reggie&#8217;s front brake pads fell off and refused to slot back in so he was out of action from the Tuesday. I took him down to the cycle shop for repairs and his annual end of year service and only got him back at the end of last week. So, even had I wanted to, it would have been impossible to get out onto the open cycle path&#8230; Then of course I&#8217;ve been driving for the Olympics here in London and that has taken up much of my time. I&#8217;m typing out this blog entry at 2am in my London 2012 BMW as I sit waiting for the great and the good of the Olympic movement to request a car. They probably won&#8217;t until later in the morning&#8230;<br />
However, yesterday I finally pulled on the Lycra shorts and a t-shirt, pushed Reggie out of the flat and set off on a short adventure. My route was not planned so I randomly started to pedal east, along the A4 to Twyford, then Wargrave and towards Henley-on-Thames at which point I slowly started to complete a long loop through South-East Oxfordshire which brought me back to Reading by the early evening. It was a 38 mile jaunt and much of the journey was through the rain which started just after I had paused for a drink at the Maharajah&#8217;s Well in Stoke Row. But although the rain could dampen my clothes, it couldn&#8217;t and didn&#8217;t dampen my spirits; being back out on the bike was a delight and as I cut back and forth along and into the nooks and crannies of the countryside, I had a broad smile in my mind if not inanely planted on my face; I was happy.</p>
