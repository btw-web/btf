<h1>At Half Speed In Bellinzona</h1>
<p>My one-day lay off from the cycling has at least allowed me to catch up on the domestics, notably the washing but also a shave for the first time in the best part of a week. It has also given me the chance to explore the town of Bellinzona itself.<br />
It&#8217;s the capital of Ticino although I have to say I&#8217;d never heard of it until Claus Zimmerman pointed out that there was a campsite here. Even then I thought it was just a stopping off point en route down the valley. Well, thanks to Napoleon, it is more than just that. There is a small plaque outside the police station thanking him for making the town the administrative centre for this region.<br />
The main attractions apart from the well-maintained and attractive streets and squares are the three castles; Castelgrande, Castello di Montebello &amp; Castello di Sasso Corbaro. The one you see in this picture is the first one. The others are on the side of the mountain behind me and formed a barrier across the valley. Mirroring the futility of the Maginot Line that I mentioned last week, this set of fortifications was ultimately just as useless as the Swiss won the town under the Treaty of Arona in 1803. Don&#8217;t worry, I didn&#8217;t spend all afternoon in the town&#8217;s archives, I&#8217;m just quoting from the guidebook.<br />
All three castles are as dark and foreboding as the weather was this morning and from the top of the tower, you get great views up and down the valley.<br />
I&#8217;m now in a bar en route back to the campsite. I have been feeling lethargic all day; nothing to do with the efforts of the last two days just the fact that when I looked out of my tent this morning and saw the soggy sight outside, I mentally switched off and have done everything today at half speed which I have to say is thoroughly relaxing.<br />
In a short while (think if a &#8220;short while&#8221; and double it for the &#8220;short while&#8221; I will be taking), I&#8217;ll finish my walk to the campsite and check over the tent. Now that the rain has stopped I am hopeful that it will once more be its wonderful dry self again. Henry Helium has taken the brunt of the elements in the last few days but he is surviving. A small leak in the roof thanks to a stupid design too intricate to explain here is his only problem. Well my problem when I get dripped upon.<br />
I will then try and answer all of your messages / comments that have been posted on here in the last couple of days. I haven&#8217;t successfully managed to get on a Wi-Fi connection since Lucerne but there is one at the current site which I will try to use later today. Check out your comments later this evening; I should have respoonded by then.<br />
And tomorrow I head for Como by following the final section of the Swiss route 3. Simone: thanks for your messages &#8211; I will be on touch but it&#8217;s looking like Saturday is the day I will be heading south from Como&#8230;.</p>
