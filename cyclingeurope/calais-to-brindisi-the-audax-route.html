<h1>Calais To Brindisi: The Audax Route</h1>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">John Davies, the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Audax</span> cyclist from <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Willsden</span> has emailed back with some more details of the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Audax</span> route from Calais to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Brindisi</span>. He writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Attached is an article from the most recent edition of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Arrivée</span>, the magazine of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Audax</span> UK. It doesn&#8217;t really give you much information about the route, but is useful background reading. Abraham completed the ride (or Brevet as we call them) at <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Audax</span> pace, which is 200 <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">kms</span> per day. Each day he has to get his &#8220;Brevet card&#8221; stamped to prove he has completed the daily distance. Hence why is arriving and departing hotels at unconventional times.</em> <span style="color: #000099;"><em>Two of my <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">clubmates</span> rode the C-B (in fact they rode from <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Brindisi</span> to Calais) about 25 years ago, they completed the distance in a remarkable 9 days. They will have chose the shortest route possible, rather than the most interesting one.</em></span></p></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This last point about the shortest route, not the most interesting one is at the heart of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Audax</span> cycling, or so I am increasingly thinking. While there is a joy in travelling the maximum distance in the minimum time for some, even me on occasions (hence my efforts to cut the time I commute to work every day), it&#8217;s not really what I am aiming to do. The article that John has attached to his email (and which I will try to attach to this blog once I&#8217;ve finished writing this &#8211; it will probably appear in the next post, just above) is interesting but even the guy who wrote it &#8211; Abraham Cohen &#8211; says <span style="color: #000099;"><em>I must say that this ride took me through some amazing scenery, beautiful architecture, lovely little roads but the pressure to complete my task stopped me from enjoying the tranquility of the places</em></span>. Quite. It reminds me of the James Bond villain played by Robert <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Carlisle</span> who asked &#8220;What is the point of living if you don&#8217;t feel alive?&#8221;.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I wrote down all the places that Cohen mentions in his article and plugged them into the Topocoding site I mentioned last week to see what the route is like and, as you would imagine (and can see &#8211; it&#8217;s up there on the right), it follows the Via Francigena more closely than the EuroVélo 5 route. Sigeric and his mates all those years ago had the same mindset as the Audax cyclists of today: to get to Rome (in his case) in the shortest possible time so it&#8217;s logical to follow the most direct route, albeit on the Adriatic coast of Italy rather than the coast to Rome. I&#8217;ll stick with the EuroVélo route for the time being at least which takes me through Belgium and along the Franco-German border towards Switzerland and then over the Alps. It is worth considering however if the Adriatic coast would a better route to follow. It is shorter but would mean not going to Rome. A decision for later I think.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I&#8217;ve also been contacted this week by Jean-Marie <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_19" class="blsp-spelling-error">Vion</span> from Belgium who writes: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><span style="color: #000099;">I&#8217;m planning also to go to Italy by bike. So i would like to know where i can find the details of routes passed by Brussels in Belgium to go to Italy. My destination point is Venice.</span></em></p></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color: #000000;">Well, Jean-Marie, keep reading and hopefully in the near future I&#8217;ll work them out for myself. <a href="http://calver.travellerspoint.com/">John <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_20" class="blsp-spelling-error">Calver&#8217;s</span> blog</a> is the nearest I have come so far to detailed information about the route. I think the chances of any greater detail about the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_21" class="blsp-spelling-error">EuroVélo</span> route 5 being made available officially in time for next summer are slim. I&#8217;ll keep watching the <a href="http://www.ecf.com/">European Cyclists Federation</a> website for information but I haven&#8217;t seen anything yet.</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I&#8217;ll now try and work out how I can possibly attached the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_22" class="blsp-spelling-error">PDF</span> file to the blog so others can read the article about the guy who cycled from Calais to <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_23" class="blsp-spelling-error">Brindisi</span>.</p>
