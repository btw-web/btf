<h1>Poring Over Straightforward Errors</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is perhaps a post I should not write. When my father had finished reading Good Vibrations, his first comment was that there were quite a few typos. I was a slightly put out by his comment. I had re-read the manuscript of my comical tale very carefully to try and spot any deviations from correct English usage and had managed to find quite a few which I duly corrected. I knew that somewhere within the 300 pages that I had produced there would be others but that they would be few and far between. My father&#8217;s comment did however make me wonder. Unfortunately, he hadn&#8217;t noted down the errors so I was really none the wiser as to where they were.</p>

He is, of course Italian and English is his second language but he has managed to find some obvious, but interestingly, some not so obvious errors. Some of them are careless; &#8220;<em>straight forward</em>&#8221; rather than &#8220;<em>straightforward</em>&#8220;, &#8220;<em>i made&#8221;, &#8220;c,est pas possible&#8221;</em> &amp; &#8220;<em>round-about</em>&#8220;. I should have spotted them myself. A few others are just as careless but perhaps require a moment of thought; I needed &#8220;<em>principle</em>&#8221; in one sentence not &#8220;<em>principal</em>&#8221; and when referring to a steep downhill section of road it was a &#8220;<em>descent</em>&#8221; not, of course &#8220;<em>decent</em>&#8220;. Hand on heart however, I&#8217;m really not sure whether I would have found some of the others that he has spotted. I wrote &#8220;<em>pouring over maps</em>&#8220;. It looks OK, no? Well in fact the correct spelling is &#8220;<em>poring over maps</em>&#8220;. I never knew that. Have you even taken up the &#8220;<em>reigns</em>&#8220;? Well, you shouldn&#8217;t have! You should have been reaching for the &#8220;<em>reins</em>&#8221; instead. <a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/place_pigalle_242204417_std1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5033" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2011/10/02/poring-over-straightforward-errors/place_pigalle_242204417_std-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/place_pigalle_242204417_std1.jpg?fit=355%2C290&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="355,290" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;9.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;FinePixS2Pro&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1131677063&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;70&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0055555555555556&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="place_pigalle_242204417_std" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/place_pigalle_242204417_std1.jpg?fit=300%2C245&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/place_pigalle_242204417_std1.jpg?fit=355%2C290&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5033" title="place_pigalle_242204417_std" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/place_pigalle_242204417_std1.jpg?resize=150%2C122" alt="" width="150" height="122" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Most embarrassing as a French teacher who has escorted dozens of teenagers along the <em>Boulevard de Clichy</em> in Paris is my mis-spelling of Pigalle; not &#8220;<em>Pigaille&#8221;</em>. I am genuinely impressed by Marcello&#8217;s mastery of the English language. The worrying thing is that so far he has only got as far as day seven of my journey. I fear a few more cringe-worthy corrections to come.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you have read the book and have spotted anything that needs changing, please let me know. I shall blush in private. And if you haven&#8217;t yet purchased, please don&#8217;t let it put you off; of the 110,000 words, on current estimates, only one in two thousand contains an error. Sorry&#8230; I&#8217;ll make sure that the Kindle version of the book is updated as soon as possible.</p>
