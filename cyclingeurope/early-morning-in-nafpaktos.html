<h1>Early Morning In Nafpaktos</h1>
<p>So, from the jaws of potential disaster comes another pleasant surprise. In this case it is the small coastal town of Nafpaktos. It&#8217;s quite bustling on this Monday morning as the residents wake up to another week at work, play or (let&#8217;s face it for most of the Greeks you see) sitting in a bar drinking coffee and soaking up the sun. (Lest I provoke some diplomatic incident can I just say that I&#8217;m sure the Greeks are no more or less industrious than the rest of us. OK, the Germans are probably a bit more industrious&#8230;)<br />
Nafpaktos, which should surely merit an entry in the dictionary of places with silly names, even gets a positive write up in my guide book. The harbour is a delight and from my vantage point here in the square I can see the sprawling Venetian castle dating from the15th century. It&#8217;s nice to see something historic that isn&#8217;t referred to as &#8216;ancient&#8217;. I don&#8217;t have the inclination to push a fully-laden bike up the hill to explore it in more detail but it look very pretty from down here. The town is also very cycle-friendly. It has cycle routes, signage and even a bike sharing scheme. Just a pity that as I tried to cycle along the main street earlier, many residents had interpreted the markings on the cycle lanes &amp; signage as a licence to park their cars in them. Mmm&#8230; I pinged my loud bell at each one of them in disgust. Bearing in mind the use of the horn here in Greece however, I suspect the point was lost upon them.<br />
Before leaving the hotel &#8211; cracking all-you-can-eat breakfast by the way &#8211; I studied the map while strolling half naked on the balcony. Too much information? You didn&#8217;t need to know where I was did you? I&#8217;ve decided upon a route towards Albania that will keep me close, mostly very close, to the coast. There is a campsite marked on the map at a place called Mitikas. I couldn&#8217;t find a reference to it on Google however (there is another place called Mitikas over in the east with a campsite) so I&#8217;ll just have to hope. The town does also have hotels. Slightly further north is Paleros. Ed Cox who is cycling from Bristol to Brisbane did pass on a contact in Paleros but I haven&#8217;t heard anything from him. I wonder where Ed currently is as he said he might be in the area around the 7th. Today is the 8th I think. I&#8217;ll look out for him as I cycle.<br />
Lots of today&#8217;s route is lined in green which on a Michelin map means &#8216;scenic route&#8217;. After yesterday&#8217;s drab relentless trapse from Olympia to Patra I am hopeful of something more pleasant on the eyes although that does usually mean that it is more strenuous on the legs.<br />
So, while you&#8217;re contemplating my toned calf and thigh muscles here&#8217;s an arty picture of Reggie and the castle in Nafpaktos. </p>
