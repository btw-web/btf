<h1>A Good Reason To Dislike McDonald&#8217;s</h1>
<p>The food is fine; I&#8217;ve just had a Big Mac and fries for the first time in years and it was great. I don&#8217;t have an issue with what they sell at all as long as people don&#8217;t live off the stuff. I know some do which is very sad but the vast majority don&#8217;t and we can&#8217;t blame the likes of McDonald&#8217;s for our obese children; the issue is closer to home than that.<br />
I came in, not for the food but for the Internet access&#8230; but I had forgotten that Italy has laws which mean that all Internet use must be logged and to access the Wi-Fi network here in the Como branch of McDonald&#8217;s I needed to provide an Italian mobile number&#8230; Bugger. I had bought my Big Mac &amp; fries in vain&#8230; This is going to be an issue throughout Italy so expect lots of posts from me but only limited ability to respond.<br />
The issue I do have with McDonald&#8217;s is that it is the worst place in the world to try and speak a foreign language. Most of the items on the menu never seem to be translated into the local language so when you make an order it&#8217;s a real juggling act between using English and in this case Italian. I refuse to be one of those people who just walks in to any establishment outside an English-speaking country and automatically speaks English. In Switzerland I made sure that I was able to say in German &#8220;sorry I don&#8217;t speak German, do you speak English?&#8221; and used the expression to the point of boredom.<br />
But entering this restaurant I did try and speak Italian only to be prompted by the person next in the queue who detected that I was English-speaking because I was able to pronounce &#8220;Big Mac&#8221; perfectly! There was nothing wrong with the Italian bits of the sentence! There continued a very difficult conversation, me trying my best to speak McDonald&#8217;s Italian and being prompted from all sides by people who thought I was just another English languages dunce. Arghhh!!! Rant over&#8230; Time to go and stare at the serenity of the lake and calm down.<br />
I meet Simone by the way tomorrow at 8.37am outside the station for our cycle to Pavia via Milan.<br />
And the picture, if you were wondering is my view from the window of McDonald&#8217;s keeping an eye on Reggie who is fixed to the post onto other side of the street.</p>
