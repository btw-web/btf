<h1>York: Cycling City Of The North?</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If Newcastle had been at one end, York should have been at the other end of the familiarity spectrum during my visit to Yorkshire &amp; the North East of England last week; I had, after all spent three years in the city <span style="color:#444444;line-height:23px;">as a student, </span>albeit over twenty years ago.</p>

There are certainly lots of new buildings occupying the bits of the campus that used to be open green lawns, but the drab concrete core that I remember from the late 1980s was still there to guide me around the site. My old college &#8211; Wentworth &#8211; has new accommodation blocks where the old ones used to sit, but at its heart &#8211; the college itself &#8211; it remains as it was; a cheap pre-fab wooden building with a few modern additions &amp; rearrangements &amp; a nice new bridge across the lake. The most shocking of the changes is to the college bar which has been converted into a (get this) reading room. A den of iniquity transformed into a paradise of silence &amp; study. Surely a reflection that standards in education are being maintained or probably enhanced. It may of course be the case that the old two-storey library made for a more spacious location for downing the pints and they simply swapped over functions. I didn&#8217;t investigate so am only left to wonder.</p>

First stop the Minster. I wanted a leisurely walk under its lofty ceiling but an equally lofty entrance price of £9 gave me second thoughts. I left the cathedral to the believers (in God as well as free-market economics) and headed into the streets and alleys of the very old town. Well, the bit with timber-framed houses which are now home to gift shops, art galleries, fancy sweet shops &amp; the inevitable Edinburgh Wollen Mill. A coffee in the more contemporary Caffe Nero allowed for a few moments of Internet browsing. I remembered that <a href="http://www.cyclorama.net" target="_blank">Cyclorama</a> &#8211; a new publication about all things cycling which I had received  on a swap arrangement for my own little tome &#8211; was based in York, but where? It would make for an interesting diversion in my day if I could find it. Google provided the answers and off I went, heading towards Fulford. More of the visit to Cyclorama <a href="http://cyclingeurope.org/2012/09/02/cyclorama-get-cycling/" target="_blank">here</a>&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A couple of hours later, back in the centre of the city and with batteries recharged  (both mine and my iPhone which was desperately low; it gave me a good excuse to sit in the Cross Keys pub near the Minster, plug the phone into a wall socket while I sipped away on two pints of beer reading the newspaper), I returned to wandering. My mind turned towards cycling once again. Did York live up to its reputation of being the cycling capital of the north. I can&#8217;t remember if I had a bicycle when I was a student (which probably means that I didn&#8217;t&#8230;) but in the city centre I had only passed one small bike shop tucked away under one of the bridges across the Ouse (although I later noticed a larger place at the station entrance), there weren&#8217;t cycle lanes in any greater number than there are in say <a href="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/img_2693.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="7207" data-permalink="https://cyclingeurope.org/2012/08/31/york-cycling-city-of-the-north/img_2693/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/img_2693.jpg?fit=1936%2C1936&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1936,1936" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="IMG_2693" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/img_2693.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/img_2693.jpg?fit=890%2C890&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7207 alignright" title="IMG_2693" src="https://i0.wp.com/cyclingeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/img_2693.jpg?resize=300%2C299" alt="" width="300" height="299" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Reading where I now live and the number of cyclists actually on the streets was, well, normal for the UK. By &#8216;normal for the UK&#8217; I mean of course that there were a few but nothing of Cambridge proportions. So much for York being a haven for cyclists. York&#8217;s credentials for being a &#8216;Cycling City&#8217; &#8211; it was officially recognised as one a few years ago along with more outstanding candidates such as Bristol &#8211; seemed pretty thin on the ground and it was something that cropped up in my conversation with a cycling paramedic who was reading a book in the small park tucked away behind the Minster. She said that the when the accolade had first been attributed to York &#8216;there were signs everywhere&#8217; but now, a few years later they had all disappeared. If the award had been given in order to give the city a kick up the cycling backside (it&#8217;s a place that has much going for it when it comes to cycling notably that it is flat, not too big and has a large population of students) it clearly hadn&#8217;t worked. What a great pity. A great missed opportunity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, a bit disappointing on the cycling level but on many others a nice day out revisiting what used to be familiar nooks and crannies. I ended the afternoon with a short walk around the gardens of the Yorkshire Museum which is currently hosting the biannual Mystery Plays. The last time the museum hosted the event was back in 1988 and I remember attending the event that year so it seemed fitting that I was there again to see that it had returned. Not that I saw anything of the play, just the main actor Graeme Hawley who found fame as serial killer John Stape in Coronation Street. It was a little disconcerting to see him playing with his daughter &amp; feeding the ducks in a public park&#8230;</p>
