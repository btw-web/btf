<h1>California Basketpackin&#8217;</h1>
<p>I recently returned from an extended bout of dirt road riding in Southern California, squeezing in the excellent <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/stagecoach-400-bikepacking-route/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stagecoach 400</a>, an overnighter in beautiful Los Padres, the unexpectedly wild <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/la-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Observer</a>, plus several protracted wanderings around <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/bike-touring-joshua-tree-dirt-roads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua Tree</a>. I also rode from San Diego to Los Angeles, via the abandoned railway line that runs through the Carrizo Gorge, various washes in the Anza Borrego State Park, the wonderfully bizarre Salton Sea and counter-culture capital of Slab City (using the new Stagecoach 500 detour), Joshua Tree National Park, Big Bear Lake, Lake Arrowhead, snowy Baldy Notch, and lofty Mount Lowe. A part of the ride became a route we dubbed the <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/socal-desert-ramble/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SoCal Desert Ramble</a>, whilst we named the last segment the <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/baldy-bruiser/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Baldy Bruiser</a> &#8211; it makes a great long weekend ride out of LA with public transport connections.</p>

<p>Setup-wise, I went all &#8216;basketpacking&#8217; on this trip, aboard Tumbleweed&#8217;s <a href="/bikes/tumbleweed/">Prospector</a>. Setup wise, a modified <a href="http://www.rivbike.com/products/wald-wire-basket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Wald 139 </a>(trimmed to save weight), <a href="http://surlybikes.com/parts/cargo/8_pack_rack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Surly 8-Pack</a>, and a <a href="http://monkeywrenchcycles.com/introducing-the-monkey-wrench-bag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monkey Wrench Cycles</a> proved a great combination for the trip, given my need to work en route (thus the requirement for my MacBook Air and DLSR camera) while still keeping &#8216;relatively light&#8217;, to best enjoy the dirt, sandy, and rocky roads I had in mind. The desire not to have panniers rattling around and my dislike of wearing a backpack also played a part in choosing this setup, as it&#8217;s both relatively streamlined and rooomy. </p>

<p>But what about all that extra weight above the steering axis, I hear you ask? It&#8217;s true, a big basket like the Wald 139 isn&#8217;t my chosen cargo-carrying solution for a super techy route, like the <a href="/routes/bikepacking-the-colorado-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colorado Trail</a>. The extra front end weight also makes more involved hike-a-bikes challenging too. But not all routes are created equal. For general dirt road explorations, the venerable wire basket makes a lot of sense. It&#8217;s supremely practical, both at home and on tour. It offer multiple lashing points. Such a setup offers quick access to a DLSR camera &#8211; mine lives on top of my sleeping bag &#8211; as well as the means to load up with extra food when required, especially the likes of voluminous bags of corn chips or loaves of bread. As for all that front load, I quickly adapted to the way it impacted the Prospector&#8217;s handing for dirt road riding and it felt just fine. Lastly, easily detaching the bag and bringing it into my tent at night or a coffee shop during the day proved to be another advantage. </p>

<p>Speaking of which, there are various basket/bag solutions available. I chose the Porcelain Rocket-made Monkey Wrench Cycles bag for this trip. It&#8217;s deceptively simple but works extremely well. It&#8217;s padded too, which helps it keep its shape and provides protection for my camera. At full capacity, the bag is simply cavernous. To those concerned that such indulgent space might encourage you into carrying too much gear, fear not. Overloading the front end definitely effects quick handling antics, which encouraged me to keep to a lean setup for day to day touring. However, having the ability to max the bag out temporarily with extra food and even water on occasions proved extremely useful, given the desert conditions and the distance between resupply points. In such situations, the Tetris-like game of loading up a bikepacking rig can sometimes be trying, especially when it comes to carrying light but bulky food without resorting to a backpack. For long distance tours, I value a balance between practicality and minimalism. </p>

<p>Another new piece of gear that worked out especially well was Porcelain Rocket&#8217;s custom Mr Fusion XL. Given my height (6&#8217;1&#8243;) and the ample space between bag and tire (especially when I&#8217;m running 27.5+ tires), I asked Scott Felter to make me a <em>really</em> big seatbag, that would maximise the space I have between my seat and tire for long distance, overseas tours. He came back with an awesome piece of gear expands to fit a whole litter of puppies with room to spare, or compresses relatively small to squeeze in just a few kittens. As with his traditional Mr Fusion, it includes his stabilising system that keeps such a large bag from waggling side to side. This has since made it into production and can be seen on his <a href="https://porcelainrocket.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">site</a>, as have various other waterproof basketbags. </p>
<p>Talking of my &#8216;relatively light&#8217; setup (and I use the term loosely), here&#8217;s a full list what I carried. It&#8217;s one that tides me through almost everything, bar real extremes of temperatures, whether it be a weekend away or a multi-month undertaking. Temperatures were of the T-shirt-weather-in-the-day variety, with chilly starts and a couple of extremely cold, frozen-solid-waterbottle nights. I also experienced a few bouts of heavy rain, given the deluge the West Coast has been experiencing this winter. For trips where I&#8217;m expecting regular precipitation, I&#8217;d add some rain pants and a heavier weight waterproof jacket. Altitudes over the month ranged from -300ft to 7500ft (-100m to 2300m).</p>
