<h1>Gear Stuff, Mike&#8217;s bike</h1>
<p>While relaxing in an air conditioned hotel in a steamy and not so savory town of Sayaxché in the Peten region of Guatemala I figured it was as good a time as ever to make the obligatory bike touring blog gear post. Most people do this in the time leading up to leaving on their first tour but by that point I was just about bored to death with bike component nerdery. Well, not really&#8230;I reconfigured or thought about changing just about everything regarding my bike and gear. The final set up was more the product of being the way it was when it was time to leave rather then the final perfect set up.</p>
<p>I originally purchased a 26&#8243; Long Haul Trucker on Ebay but had to return it as it was not the size the seller had advertised it as. I then bought the 18&#8243; Troll from Ebay as well. It was a custom build for a decent price but I ended up transferring most of the components to my full suspension Kona. On long rides I often wonder if the Long Haul Trucker would be better or at least how it would ride different. My original plans involved fitting Salsa Woodchipper drop bars. I think I should have stuck with that idea as numbness and a desire for more hand positions is a bigger issue than I woud have thought for me.</p>
<p>I like this bike, I like it a lot but I am not sure if I love it. At times the frame feels too small like I want to be further back from the cranks even though the Salsa Shaft post has a decent amount of setback. I think a 19&#8243; frame, if one existed of this model, would be perfect for me. I also think a little more room in the triangle would be better for water bottles and potentially a frame mounted pump. Or not&#8230;</p>
<p>After almost 3 months of my first tour my main impression bike-wise is that these things take a beating. The frame and the racks get dinged and scratched. They get grime and dirt and salt water on them and they will rust. I don&#8217;t know how to avoid it, especially the racks. I wonder how long these things can last without being completely babied. I have decided that I will just see what happens with them with a reasonable amount of care. I could attempt to touch up every scratch but I own this bike to take me places not to keep it immaculate. I try to remind myself of that and will see how it holds up.</p>
<p>While riding I have spent a large amount of time mentally configuring an 700c Long Haul Trucker for a potential European tour or maybe even a tour of Western US or Canada. However I would likely just go for the complete build, it just makes more sense price wise. After pondering every minute detail of this bike it would be nice to just get on it and ride.</p>
<p>To my friends and family who are interested in food and culture and photos of exotic places and have no interest in bike frames and components I apologize. This post was overdue and being a blog dedicated to bike touring maybe someone planning their own bike build will stumble upon this in their preparations like the many I found and used in the time leading up to this tour.</p>
