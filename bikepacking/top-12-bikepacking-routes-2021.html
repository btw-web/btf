<h1>Top 12 Bikepacking Routes</h1>
<p>We&#8217;ve been creating and maintaining a library of original bikepacking routes and route guides since 2014 (well, really since this site was launched back in 2012). We also curate and promote loads of routes from other developers all over the world. </p>
<p>Out of curiosity, we dug into our stats to figure out which of our route guides were the most visited in 2021. In this video, we count down the 12 most popular bikepacking routes in our network for 2021. Neil digs into each route and shares what you can expect, when to ride them, and what the proper bike might be for each. Watch it here, scroll down for links, and let us know your favorites in the conversation below.</p>
