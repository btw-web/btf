<h1>Sisters in the Wild Slovenia 2021 Tickets on Sale</h1>
<p>The next Sisters in The Wild gathering was just announced for early September of this year in Slovenia. This isn’t a race or a trail riding event, but a community-building experience for women, non-binary, and trans folks. The Sisters in The Wild event was created to encourage women to push themselves in an environment where they can feel comfortable, giving them the opportunity to face their personal challenges in a supportive, pressure-free environment. Find the beautiful recap from the 2020 event <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/sisters-in-the-wild-2020-recap/">here</a>, and scroll down for the press release from SITW.</p>
<div class="spotlight">
It’s time for us to meet, share our experiences and link up with new riding companions. Sharing struggles, fears, tears and laughs. Support each other climbing up the hills, talk under the starry sky and enjoy some hearty meals.</p>
<p>This is not a race, neither is it a riding event, but a community building experience.</p>
<p>The event will take place in Bled, a small town on the doorstep of the Julian Alps. We will pitch the tents on our private basecamp from where we will take daily rides, exploring Bled’s surroundings. After the legs tire out, we’ll return to the camp for a hearty meal beside a campfire.</p>

<p>Please note: Each participant is obligated to sign the accident waiver prior to the event.</p>
<p>COVID-19: Any cancellation due to Covid-19 travel restrictions will be fully refunded. </p>
<p>We will encourage all the staff and participants to take everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19. This includes: cleaning your hands often (soap and disinfection provided in the bathrooms), cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. All activities will be taking place outside (camping, riding, eating). We kindly ask participants that in case of sickness or showing any symptoms of Covid-19 stay at home.</p></div>
