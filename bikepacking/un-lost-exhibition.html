<p>‘Un-Lost’ is inspired by a pre-race briefing given to riders by the race’s late founder, Mike Hall, in which he stressed the race’s need for self-reliance and resilience: “if you get lost, you’ll need to get un-lost.” Camille’s photographs capture the riders as they navigate unfamiliar and vast landscapes of Europe, showing that in an age of SPOT trackers, GPS and Google Maps, there’s something to be said for being lost and finding your way again.</p>
<p>“I was in an exhibition called ‘Lost’ over twenty years ago,” says Camille, “pre-geotagging and NAVSAT. It was still possible to get physically lost, and it could happen accidentally. Now we have to choose to get lost &#8211; or so it seems. As a photographer on the Transcontinental, I am forced to really study the riders, and their habitat. I may have little or no idea where I am, but if I am taking a photo of it, I am forced to get to know it, and if I’ve got to know a place, then am I really lost? Participation in the Transcontinental Race, either as a rider or as a photographer, can remind us what it’s like to be lost, and how to find our way again.”</p>
<p>The exhibition will open on December 12th, running until February 15th 2018. Prints from the exhibition will be on sale at retailers and online. Each photo will be available as a limited edition, numbered print, or as a smaller, unlimited print. Camille will also be hosted by a select number of stores for events throughout the three-month period.</p>

<h4>About Camille McMillan</h4>
<p>Camille McMillan has been obsessed with cycling for as long as he’s been obsessed with photography. As an 11-year-old, he took his camera to the 1979 World Road Race Championship &#8211; a combination of art and sport that has shaped his career. After years of covering the world’s biggest races, perched on the back of a photo-moto, Camille has turned his lens on the excitement, adventure, and stunning landscapes of the Transcontinental. He has two published books: Circus, a collection of photos from his time spent documenting pro cycling, and Bunker Research, a winner at the British Book Awards.
