<h1>Marin de Saint-Exupery Sets a New Hope 1000 Record</h1>
<p><em>Photos by Rue Kaladyte (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/rugilekaladyte/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@rugilekaladyte</a>)</em></p>
<p>The Hope 1000 is a 1,000-kilometer self-supported mountain bike route across the Swiss Alps that combines a medley of singletrack, doubletrack, gravel roads, and quiet paved lanes that rack up over 30,000 meters of climbing. As Lael Wilcox put it, to ride this route in four days &#8220;is like climbing Mount Everest every day for four days in a row.&#8221; The race kicked off last week with 76 riders participating. Marin de Saint-Exupéry finished first with a course record-setting time of 3 days, 16 hours, and 56 minutes (03:16:56) beating Jochen Böhringer&#8217;s 2020 time of 3 days, 17 hours, and 30 minutes (03:17:30). </p>
<p>Originally from from Paris, Marin is a 24-year-old bike messenger currently living in Renens, Switzerland. After the race, photographer Rugile Kaladyte and Lael Wilcox sat down with Marin to discuss his race experience and life leading up to the event. Find the full interview transcript below along with a photoset from Rue.</p>

<div class="ad"></div>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> I think it’s exciting to talk about how it ended up because everyone’s watching and first this guy Markus is way ahead, not sleeping and then all of the sudden, he’s gone and then it’s you and Joan. So did you ride together?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> At first we were really at the same speed and we were catching each other and we just started to stay together. By the end, we thought to push from not the last climb, but the climb before, we pushed quite hard and then we got down and he was a bit over, so I went.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> And when you left, were you looking to see if he was coming?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> No, I knew he was done and I was in pretty good shape, so I just went full gas, but it’s funny on the way down, just before this really rooty singletrack, I went left and I missed my way. And that’s funny, all my friends saw it, and they were like, &#8220;what did you do this time?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> Because he’s only 12 minutes behind.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> And if you make a wrong turn for ten minutes, he catches you.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> That’s really funny because he said he made the same mistake. Exactly the same.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> He did! So, then it was the same.</p>

<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> because it’s hard to see. You’re also riding at night and I think it was raining too.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, really pouring rain. My light was with a red flash. That means I have almost no light.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> You had no light left?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> almost none and I was really scared to walk down because I had no more light.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> you’re in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> I looked at your Instagram a little and I wish you had more photos there because I think what you’re doing is amazing. You were a bike messenger beforehand? Or are you a bike messenger?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yes, I’m still a bike messenger.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> How did you get into riding bikes and bikepacking? And maybe your adventure from riding from Switzerland to Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan). How did you get into riding bikes?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> That’s a long story. I was living in Paris, so I was born there and I grew up there and it was the trend of fixed gear bikes, so I just had a fixed gear and I wanted to study industrial design, so I was really interested in the object of the bicycle and fixed gears were cool. I moved to Switzerland to study industrial design. So, I discovered mountains and stuff like that. And I just saw the movie of the Trans Continental and I was just inspired by that and I tried the Trans Continental.</p>
<div class="ad"></div>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> When was this? What year did you do the Trans Continental?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> It was four years ago. I was 20. And I did a second time after and then I did the Silk Road Mountain Race.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> And rode from here to Bishkek?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, I didn’t want to take the plane, at least for the way there, and I had time and a bit of money, so I just rode there.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> Do you know how far it was to bike to Bishkek?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> It was 8,000km. I didn’t go to the north. I went to the south, from Turkey, I crossed the Black Sea by boat and then I crossed the desert through Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and traveled through Kyrgyzstan from the south, through the mountains.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> That’s super cool!</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, that was really amazing.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> I mean, that’s a bigger adventure than the race.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, of course! It was more meaningful. And to cross the desert by bicycle, this desert in particular, is quite amazing. It’s the real Silk Road, in fact. You can really see the trucks coming from China and going to Europe.</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> Yeah, so did you see the race first and say, “I’ll do the race and ride to the start?”</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> I saw the race first, but yeah, I just wanted to take some time to ride. There is also this question of taking planes. People are aware that it’s more and more a problem to travel by plane. I just wanted to avoid taking the plane. From the beginning, then, I wanted to return by train, but I was too tired, so I just took the plane. But if I get back to the Silk Road, I really want to travel by train.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> Yeah, that would be super cool! With some really old trains. It might take as long as going by bike.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> I calculated it. You can do it in a week on the bicycle.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> Maybe. Maybe you can! 8,000km! That’s super cool.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> How did you hear about the Hope 1000? I mean, it’s here in your home country.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> I guess I heard from social media or something like that, but I also had friends who’ve done it in the past. I work in a bike shop and we do work with Willi Felix (the organizer of the Hope 1000). My boss called him and told him, “we also have a rider on the start list.”</p>

<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> small world!</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> It’s local people and bicycles.</p>
<div class="ad"></div>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> Can you tell us about your bike? Why did you choose this? It looks like front suspension, rigid back, anything special about your bike?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> I just bought it one year ago because I’m totally new to mountain biking. I did the Silk Road on a gravel bike which was a pretty bad idea. So, when I came back, I just decided to buy a mountain bike. To be honest, I work in a bike shop where we have Merida and that was the best price for me. It was an easy choice.</p>

<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> Would you change anything or was it good?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> A dropper seatpost maybe?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> Yeah, because it’s so steep.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> And I’m not really good technically, so it’s easier. And maybe the tires are a bit too light. </p>

<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> And pretty worn out!</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, I should have changed them before the race.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> I heard you say that you made your half framebag. Did you make all of your bags?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> There are two that are Apidura and the other bags I made. I made the framebag and the front bag.</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> Is that your first time making bags for your bike?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> No. As I mentioned, I did some industrial design studies and my diploma project was a bike and I made the bike and the bags. I raced the Trans Continental with this bike and so then it’s just a process, I just changed some stuff on the bags. These bags are welded with an iron. It’s a really basic process, but it’s waterproof. It’s really easy to do. I mean, everyone could do it at home.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> Did everything work? Did you have any problems?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Everything almost worked. Just some problems with the gears, but that’s no big deal. Oh, and my fork — I’m really new to MTB so I don’t know how forks work and I guess the pressure is too low. I have to check, but it was bottoming out.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> I think you had pretty much the most minimal set up. You have no stuff on your bike. What did you put where on your bike? Where did you carry food? Do you have a sleep system?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> So, I have an emergency bivvy. I would change it because during the night you wake up really wet inside—condensation. That’s pretty disgusting. And I had a foot problem due to that because I was keeping my socks on and it was staying wet all day.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> It was so wet every day, that even without that, your feet would just be wet.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, but it was even worse, I guess. I have some clothes in the front, light clothes, like a rain jacket and a sleeveless jacket, and a long sleeve merino just for warmth. And then it’s only a few tools, tubes and food.</p>

<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> Did you have any mechanical issues?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> No.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> What did you eat mostly?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> junk food. A lot of chips. I really love those and in Switzerland, there’s a great choice of chips everywhere compared to Kyrgyzstan where they are not good at all.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> What was the biggest challenge during the race?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> The first day it was the heat. We had a pretty shitty month of May in Switzerland. It was still the winter almost or the spring. It was the first time I was riding in the heat for a long time, so I got heat stroke. The first night, at 8pm, I had to stop and sleep as my heart, I could not rest anymore. I slept for an hour or so and then I started again. During the night, it was quite hard.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> And I saw you!</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> I was really sick all of the night. I couldn’t eat and drink, but still I kept going and it got better with time.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> Sometimes that happens and you just want to quit, but you rest and then you approach it a couple hours later or an hour later.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> I hoped it was going to be okay. And I don’t know the word, when the food comes up. </p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> You threw up.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yes, I threw up and in fact, I felt much better after that. I could eat again and drink again. </p>

<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> Before this race, had you ridden any parts on the route? Was it all new to you?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> I really discovered, even the trail that’s near my house, the rooty trail, I did not know it and I was really happy to come to the pass because I think, “Oh, I know the place. It’s just getting down to Montreux and the finish.” But not at all.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> And then it turns.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, it turns and you go on the roots.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> And then you go on 5km around on grass and then the roots. But there is that one spot with the big shelter. Did you see it? It was dark.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Right at the turn. Yeah, I know this shelter. </p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> I would go there just for camping.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, that’s really nice. In winter you can climb there by ski touring and we do some fondue up there. A good place with a big fireplace.</p>

<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> That is the special thing about riding in Switzerland. There are always shelters versus Kyrgyzstan, there’s nothing.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> There were the pipelines under the roads. </p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> You slept in those?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, that was perfect. They are under the road. You don’t see them. Every night I slept down there.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> This time, if you did sleep, where did you sleep?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> As you say, there is shelter everywhere in Switzerland. In farms, where there is some hay, that’s perfect because I don’t have many clothes, so on hay it’s a bit warmer.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> Did you have a favorite part of the route? Any section that you really loved?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> I was a bit disappointed by the first part. This is not mountain biking. It was too easy. There is too much tarmac, too much easy gravel. And then it got better. The second half is definitely more fun.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> Much more beautiful too.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, also.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> Higher mountain passes, more remote, I agree.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> And I didn’t know that part of Switzerland, so it was really nice to discover. It’s really different from here. The people don’t speak French at all. It’s really remote, really different. It’s kind of another country.</p>

<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> That’s where Willi lives.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> The first section ends at Willi’s house.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> His wife was out there with an umbrella, a table and water.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Oh yeah, I remember, I didn’t stop. It was on the way down the hill and I thought, “that’s nice, but it’s the beginning.”</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> That’s Will’s house. So, if anyone tours the route, he sees them out the window and he goes and chases them and invites them for a coffee.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> When Lael did the race three years ago, it was the fourth year of the race and there were maybe 30 people starting and this year, there were more like 85.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> I think maybe 150 signed up, but people cancelled because of COVID-19.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> What motivates you to race? Why do you race? It’s so unusual to put yourself through this pain and discomfort.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> I don’t know. It’s just a game. Just fun. Even at the end, it was fun. I was a bit disappointed when Markus quit because I wanted to chase him for fun and do my best.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> I was sad when he quit too. He worked so hard to get so far. He had a problem with his knees, I think.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> Maybe he could’ve rested and gotten better, but then, he’s probably thinking about it for hours and he knows what he needs to do.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> I don’t know. Stop for an hour and try again. Like you!</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, but he was three days into the race. I stopped after one day. And I guess when you have accumulated so much tiredness, when it breaks, it breaks way harder.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> Do you have any other races or adventures that you want to do?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, in October, I’ll be in Morocco to race the Atlas Mountain Race. I’m really looking forward to that. I’m also going by bike there and taking some holidays.</p>

<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> Did you make a nice route to get there?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> In fact, I have to shortcut, I don’t have that much holidays. I will take the boat in the south of France to the north of Morocco, so I’ll just go there easy.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> And for work, you work at a bike shop?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, I work 50/50 as a bike messenger and in a bike shop.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> Do you like it?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Yeah, it’s nice. Right now, it’s really hard to work in a bike shop with COVID and so on. It’s quite stressful, but I love the job.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> bike shops are crazy right now. No bikes, no nothing.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> No bikes, but twice the amount of work. So, that’s not a good equation.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> Did you have a strategy for the Hope 1000? Before the race, did you know what you were going to do?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> Not at all. I just looked at the map on the train when traveling to Romanshorn. </p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> Did you know the other racers?</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Marin:</span> I know some friends, but not competitive racers. I did not know Markus, for example, and I learned that he was third last year. And it’s funny about the record. On the last day, I asked Joan (second place finisher), “I heard there is a record and it’s a bit less than four days. Maybe we could do it.” And he told me the actual record and we were on track for it, so we said, okay, let’s do it.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Lael:</span> And you got it! Which is incredible considering all of the rain. I think last year, they had pretty much perfect conditions. Maybe some rain on the first day, but after that, it was really nice. You set the record in some of the worst conditions.</p>
<p><span class="font-sans-bold">Rue:</span> Really hot and then really wet.</p>
