<h1>South Downs Way (film)</h1>
<p>A year ago, Wahoo set out to make a film following a group of riders as they took on the UK&#8217;s historic South Downs Way Trail. The film was shot by George Marshall with Liam Yates, Sophie Edmondson, Anna Mcleod, and Neil Phillips riding the route. The voiceover is by UK cycling legend Sean Yates, who spent many years training in the area during his racing years. The region holds a special place in Sean&#8217;s heart, and these days his son Liam spends a solid amount of time exploring the same trails. Watch the film below, then scroll down for more insight about the route&#8230;</p>

<p class="quote">“These lands are dear to me. A man can walk the earth and not gaze on such beauty. A 100 mile ridge of flint and chalk, sheep, and cow. Great tribes fought in the peaks, and they say the land was carved by the devil himself. Yet I don’t see Hell. I see a white road going as far as the eye can see. I see the South Downs Way.”  <strong>—Sean Yates</strong></p>

<p>The full route featured in this video runs from Winchester to Eastbourne on over 100 miles of chalk paths and ancient roads, with 3,500 meters of elevation gain and not a car in sight. Just rolling hills as far as the eye can see. Find more at <a href="http://nationaltrail.co.uk/south-downs-way" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NationalTrail.co.uk</a>. And dig into the map below. We&#8217;d love to see someone design a nice loop using this track.</p>

<p>The focal point of the route is the South Downs National Park, a region steeped in history. For the past 8,000 years, the trail has served a number of purposes, but was namely a way of linking fortresses and settlements along the UK’s southernmost edge, with many serving as the first response to incoming invasions during wartime. Today, the South Downs Way is protected by National Trail status and is open to cyclists and hikers. </p>
