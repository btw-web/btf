<h1>The First Person to Ride the Colorado Trail fully Self-sufficient</h1>
<p>Congratulations to Todd Johnson, who just became the first person to successfully complete the Colorado Trail Race <em>fully</em> self-supported (self-sufficient). As JPaks&#8217; Joe Tonsager put it, &#8220;That means no resupply, no gas station pizza, no ice cream in Buena Vista, no funnel cakes in Silverton, and nothing extra.&#8221; Todd started the Colorado Trail Race with everything he&#8217;d need to consume over the next week, carrying the full load on his bike and his back, only taking water from the creeks and streams he passed along the way. This is quite an accomplishment when you think about the 30,000-ish calories required for such an undertaking. Find more details below.</p>

<p>Todd Johnson has spent quite a bit of time on the Colorado Trail, but this attempt was quite special. When 52-year-old Todd started the ride, he was lugging a 26 pound (11.8kg) backpack and a heavily loaded Salsa Spearfish with bags stuffed to the gills. Despite the incredible amount of weight he was carrying, Todd finished in an impressive time of 7 days and 16 hours (7d:16h:0m), although he thinks, &#8220;It’s a start, but someone is going to do it faster.&#8221; We caught up with Todd to ask him a few questions about the inspiration behind the ride, how it went, and what all he brought along.</p>

<p class="qa q">How long have you been bikepacking, and what are some of your favorite rides?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been bikepacking since 2007. I ordered my first set of bags from Jeff Boatman (Carousel Design Works) back in 2008. My other favorite route is Fitz Barn from Victor Idaho to Hamilton Montana, but I love every ride I have the chance to go on! Time on the bike, whether it&#8217;s dirt, gravel, road, or bike path, is my time to slow my thoughts down and focus on what I love to do the most.</p>

<p class="qa q">What inspired you to attempt a Colorado Trail ride fully self-sufficient?</p>
<p>What inspired me to do this fully loaded self-supported attempt on the Colorado Trail comes from guys like Stefan Griebal, Scott Morris, Jefe Branham, and my good friend Jay Petervary. I also had a mindset of doing something no one has done before. </p>

<p class="qa q">How many times have you attempted the Colorado Trail fully self-supported? And how did the other attempts go?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve attempted a fully loaded self-supported ride two times before, experience that was crucial for the success on my third attempt. On my first attempt, I made it to Tarryall Reservoir. On the second one, I made it to Leadville and then caved when I saw a taco truck! This time, my food choices changed, and more importantly my backpack choice changed; I previously used an Osprey Talon 33 on both attempts, but this time decided to use a women&#8217;s Osprey Tempest 30 because of its shorter torso fit. It fit better and was also smaller. On my other attempts, I carried way too much food and gear. I really dialed in my food choices and snacks. I also went into this trip with a different mindset of being patient and not rushing. </p>
<div class="ad"></div>
<p class="qa q">What was your food supply list like?</p>
<p>I carried all my food and stove fuel in my backpack. Here&#8217;s the full list:</p>
<ul class="arrow-list twocol">
<li>24 backpacking meals (8 Breakfasts, 8 Lunches, 8 dinners)</li>
<li>3 small canisters of fuel</li>
<li>38 packets of Hammer Nutrition Perpetuum</li>
<li>7 Packets of Heed</li>
<li>7 Packets of Recoverite</li>
<li>30 gels (which I used in the early morning hours and at high elevation during summit pushes)</li>
<li>Hammer CBD Gel caps</li>
<li>Hammer Nutrition Endurolytes</li>
<li>Oxtox Vitamin supplements</li>
<li>Salami with Ritz Crackers</li>
<li>4 Packets of Patagonia Salmon (I added Chia and Hemp seeds)</li>
<li>Strawberry Crepes</li>
<li>7 packets Tumeric Latte</li>
<li>12 Yerba Matte Tea bags</li>
<li>One giant grocery plastic bag of various snacks like crackers, Chex Mix, Bugles, chips, mangos, squeezable applesauce, and squeezable baby food</li>
</ul>

<p class="qa q">Is there anything you&#8217;d change if you did it again?</p>
<p>If I did it again, I&#8217;d bring a tent (my Big Agnes Fly Creek UL1). I&#8217;d also try to go faster! This mission was all about finishing and taking care of my body.</p>
<p class="qa q">Are you interested in trying this on any other routes?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really interested in trying this alpine-style technique on any other route, at least not at the moment. Maybe the Arizona Trail, but it takes a lot of prep to do this.</p>
<p class="qa q">What are some of your favorite sections of the Colorado Trail?</p>
<p>My Favorite segments of the Colorado Trail are  3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 22, 23, 25, 26, and 27. The detours have been growing on me over the years. When I first started riding the CTR, I didn&#8217;t like them!</p>

<p class="qa q">Is there anyone you&#8217;d like to thank?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to thank my wife Stephanie Johnson. She is the best mom and partner in the world! She has watched me build up to this trip and understands my need for adventure to re-set my attitude. I&#8217;d also like to thank Jay Petervary for the high level of motivation, and the drive to think outside the box. Last but not least, the entire family and friends of Fitzgeralds Bike Shop in Victor, Idaho, and Jackson, Wyoming. The folks working at the shop always come up clutch when it comes to my bikes and parts!</p>
