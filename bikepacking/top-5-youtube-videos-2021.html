<h1>Our Top 5 YouTube Videos of 2021</h1>
<p>We started our YouTube channel a little over a year and a half ago, and host Neil Beltchenko has been doing an outstanding job, with each video getting better. So far in 2021, we&#8217;ve published 65 videos on the channel. If you haven&#8217;t already, please <a href="https://youtube.com/bikepackingcom?sub_confirmation=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">subscribe</a> so we can keep them coming. It&#8217;s really helpful to us as subscriber numbers are important. At any rate, we were curious which videos got the most views in 2021, so we dug around to find out. Here they are, starting with number five:</p>
<h2>5. The Rig That Won The Colorado Trail Race</h2>
<p>Back in July, Neil finished his fourth Colorado Trail Race, arriving in Denver as the first rider across the finish line. In this video, he offers a detailed look at his rig, including the components, bags, and everything he was carrying. He also answers a few questions about the race and his choice of rig.</p>

<h2>4. 10 Items Not To Bring Bikepacking</h2>
<p>Some cycling accessories or products are simply not made for bikepacking. While these items may be great for day rides, oftentimes they are not a sensible options for bikepacking trips. In this video, Neil shared 10 items that we don&#8217;t recommend using for bikepacking and the reason behind it.</p>

<h2>2. Decathlon Riverside 920 Touring Review </h2>
<p>The Riverside Touring 920 from Decathlon was a super popular, wallet-friendly bike that was released back in the spring. It came with tons of bikepacking-ready features, including 33 mounts, an impressive weight capacity, and a dynamo hub and charger. Neil summed up his ride impressions, thoughts on the build, and his opinion of this value-forward bike in this review.</p>
