<h1>PEdAL ED Bikepacking Bags: First Look + How to Win Them</h1>
<p>You might know PEdAL ED for their race-styled jerseys, bibs, and cycling apparel. Or maybe you&#8217;ve noticed the brand as the title sponsor for the Transcontinental Race and the new Silk Road Mountain Race. Behind the scenes, the Japanese/Italian brand has also been quietly working on adventure-oriented gear to match the ultra-endurance races they sponsor. As a matter of fact, Joe Cruz wore their mountaineering-inspired backcountry Mido Boots during our initial scout of the <a href="/routes/tian-shan-traverse-kyrgyzstan/">Tian Shan Traverse</a>, the route that the Silk Road Race was built upon. In addition to the boots, PEdAL ED now offers an expedition jacket, gloves, and a relatively new set of bikepacking bags produced in collaboration with Italian bag maker, Miss Grape. Given their unique waterproof denim outer fabric and other interesting details, we were keen to check them out. </p>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PEdALED-Bikepacking-Bags_9.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PEdALED-Bikepacking-Bags_9-2000x1333.jpg" alt="PEdALED Bikepacking Bags, Miss Grape" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-47342" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PEdALED-Bikepacking-Bags_9-2000x1333.jpg 2000w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PEdALED-Bikepacking-Bags_9-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PEdALED-Bikepacking-Bags_9-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/PEdALED-Bikepacking-Bags_9-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a>
<p>Unfortunately for me, this is the second time I&#8217;ve had to part ways with PEdAL ED gear. I first contacted the company after hearing Joe&#8217;s glowing report on the Italian-made Mido expedition boots. They sent a pair for review, but I misjudged the sizing and had to pass them on to Cass. I was a little bummed about that, but it sounds like Cass is happy (so stay tuned for <em>his</em> review). Alongside the boots, PEdAL ED sent these bags, which I was equally enamored with. Unfortunately for me, I can&#8217;t keep them either. Instead of a full test and review, I gave them a gentle once over and will be sending them off to one lucky Bikepacking Collective member who&#8217;ll we draw randomly in a couple of weeks.

<h3>Waterproof Denim?</h3>
<p>Designed with long-distance rides in mind, and tested during the fifth Transcontinental Race, PEdAL ED&#8217;s bikepacking bag lineup includes a seat pack, top tube bag, handlebar roll, and half frame pack. Each is equipped with Riri waterproof zips, trimmed out with reflective details, and constructed with a unique lightweight waterproof denim fabric that the company claims is fully rain resistant, thanks to its internal PU coating. According to PEdAL ED, it&#8217;s made up of 76% cotton, 11% PU, 6% acrylic, and 7% nylon. When I first held them, I was surprised by how light they were. The waterproof denim isn&#8217;t as light as X-Pac, but it&#8217;s definitely a lightweight performance material. As far as its ability to shed water, I don&#8217;t doubt that the fabric does the job. However, the only bag of the four that is fully seam-taped is the Tendril handlebar roll. The others are likely highly water resistant, but in my experience, anytime there are stitches, water will bleed through during a heavy driving rain. But, that&#8217;s not to say they couldn&#8217;t be seam-sealed. Either way, the denim material gives the bags a sharp look that&#8217;s completely different from anything out there. It also has a nice feel and each bag is very well crafted. Here are the details on them, photos, and a few things I noticed while mounting them.</p>
<div class="ad"></div>
<h2>The Internode half-frame bag</h2>
<p>As with all of the bags in PEdAL ED&#8217;s roster, the Internode is constructed from PU-coated denim. The Internode is also equipped with a nice Riri “Aquazip” M8 zipper. Riri zips are high quality, durable, rather pricey, and known for having a tight waterproof seal. The Internode is otherwise fairly simple, which I appreciate. It has a 3/4 length daisy chain with seven moveable velcro straps and two webbing straps with a locking buckle. There is a little internal padding at the bag&#8217;s nose to help it keep its shape, and a sewn-in internal panel of green Cordura on the drive side under the zipper. This creates three sleeve pockets for a wallet, phone, or other sundries. The Internode also has a velcro-sealed hydration port at the front. Other standout details include a strip of reflective piping at the front of the bag and a burly zipper garage. </p>

</ul>
<p>At the moment, the PEdAL ED Internode comes in one size, medium. I actually found it to be pretty large. It wouldn&#8217;t fit on Gin&#8217;s size medium Salsa Deadwood, but seems to fit the large Surly Krampus perfectly. All in all, the Internode is probably the most straightforward and conventional bag of the four, but it&#8217;s constructed with very nice materials in a clean and useable manner. </p>

<h2>TENDRIL Handlebar Roll</h2>
<p>The Tendril is PEdAL ED&#8217;s 100% waterproof handlebar bag, and probably the bag that impressed me the most in this set. It&#8217;s designed to be mounted on either drop bars when packed narrow, or on flat MTB bars when packed really wide—which I prefer. The bag is closed by rolling the two sides in and squeezed by a compression system to minimize its external dimensions. </p>

</ul>
<p>The Tendril handlebar bag is constructed mostly out of a PU-coated nylon, similar to the material used on the waterproof Revelate Sweet Roll. It&#8217;s fairly thick and feels pretty burly. There is a single accent panel of the denim material as well as a sewn-in plastic stiffener bar. As mentioned, all of the stitches are seam-taped to make the Tendril 100% waterproof.</p>
<p>The Tendril&#8217;s strap system is fairly straightforward. It has two spring-loaded buckles that cinch the handlebar webbing straps in a texture-grip clasp. They seem fairly solid and I would expect them to keep the bag secured over the rough stuff. This particular system also makes the Tendril easy to remove and attach. Like other handlebar rolls, the Tendril also has a three-position daisy chain on its bottom to secure it to the fork crown or head tube.</p>

<p>In addition to the Tendril being fully waterproof and well made, I was most impressed by its size. Handlebar bags can often be too narrow, too short, or too fat. The Tendril seems like the Goldilocks of handlebar rolls, with just the right diameter and width. The bag can be packed anywhere from 35-65cm (13.8-25.6&#8243;) in length and is about 18cm (7.1&#8243;) in diameter.</p>

<h2>Cluster Seat Bag</h2>
<p>The PEdALED Cluster 13 is also made from waterproof denim, and like the Tendril, seems to be perfectly sized. It can cinch down pretty short, or be packed up to 49cm (19.3&#8243;) in length. Like many other seat packs, the Cluster features a single saddle rail strap, bar-tacked to a reinforced layer at the top with two locking cams to cinch the weight upward. The roll-top rear opening is nice and wide and has two female buckle ends that clip to two more straps that help leverage the weight. This is a proven design used on other similar bags, such as the Revelate Viscacha and Bedrock Coconino. Unlike those bags, the Cluster features a two-strap seat post design, likely better served for taller riders with several inches of exposed seatpost.</p>

<p>Like other seat packs, the Cluster is constructed largely from a single layer of fabric. There is a double layer at the front of the bag on its sides and bottom that sandwiches three lightweight plastic panels for added stability. For the most part, this is a familiar construction to other seat packs. However, the Cluster does have a few unique features that set it apart. The entire bottom panel is a phthalate-free PVC double coated polyester. Not only is this material extra burly, but it&#8217;s also highly waterproof, making it a great fender for shedding water and muck. Also, the Cluster has a nice reinforced nose with a sticky rubberized fabric to stabilize it against the seat post. The straps also have a rubberized interior layer. Lastly, the rear top of the bag has three daisy-chains for added utility.</p>

<p>Again, the designers at Miss Grape seem to have nailed the size perfectly. The Node is not too big, but not too small, in my opinion. It&#8217;s also really nicely made with a burly zipper garage and a Riri M6 Aquazip. In addition, the Node has an internal velcro divider and a wraparound mesh pocket on the bags exterior, a really nice touch for a top tube bag.</p>
