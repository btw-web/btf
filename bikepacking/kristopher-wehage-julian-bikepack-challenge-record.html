<h1>Kristopher Wehage Sets New Julian Bikepack Challenge Record</h1>
<p><em>Words and photos by Kristopher Wehage</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the Julian Bikepack Challenge on my radar since reading <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/win-julian-bikepack-challenge/">Miles and McCullen&#8217;s writeup</a> here on BIKEPACKING.com last year. The event looked like a great way to experience the trails of San Diego, a destination I haven&#8217;t explored much, despite living close by in Los Angeles. I had also never tried to ride 290 miles at a sporting pace before, so this event seemed a good fit as my next bikepacking challenge.</p>
<p>I started from Torrey Pines State Park, one of the three official start locations along the loop, 80 miles ahead of the main start in Julian, because of its convenient proximity to the train station. I heard there was another group departing from Lake Hodges (20 miles behind me), so I pushed to avoid being caught up by other riders I imagined were hot on my heels. I didn&#8217;t actually meet any other riders until I came across a group doing the Desert Loop on the second day. I started and ended the race alone, in the dark, in an empty parking lot.</p>

<p>My bike is a Surly Ogre with 2.6&#8243; front and 2.4&#8243; rear tires. The tire size ended up working well, providing sufficient floatation on the many sandy sections, and rolling reasonably fast on the gravel, dirt, and singletrack. Unfortunately, what did not work out so well was my lack of tubeless tires. I had serious problems with flats (eight total), especially the first night on the approach to Laguna Mountain, which was riddled with goat heads. I was slowly climbing up brushy singletrack in the dark, occasionally veering off the edge of the trail.Frustratingly, I kept picking up thorns along the way. Even when my tires were holding air, I contended with slow, worrisome leaks that I had to top off every few hours. On one occasion I pulled five goat heads and four cactus spines from one tire! I definitely recommend to future participants to heed the advice on the event website and run tubeless tires (or slime tubes) to save themselves time and frustration.</p>
<p>With moderate nighttime temperatures in the forecast and a personal goal not to spend a lot of time sleeping, I decided to leave my sleeping gear at home. I rode through the first night, then took a 15-minute power nap in the late morning. By 8:00 PM the second day, I was falling asleep at the handlebars. Unsure if I could make it through a second night, I decided to take a quick nap at lower elevation off the side of the road outside of Borrego Springs. At 10:00 PM, I was awoken by transients looking for a place to camp. I think they were as surprised as I was to find someone else out there! It was good motivation to get back on the move.</p>

<p>Some of the highlights for me include seeing the marine layer burn off with the sunrise as I started the climb away from the coast, meeting owls, hawks, roadrunners, deer, jackrabbits, and coyote, the feeling of solitude as I rode through the nights, and experiencing the vast diversity of terrain and trail conditions this route offers. Just when I became accustomed to my environment, it morphed into something else altogether.</p>
<p>The organizers did a fantastic job linking together so many off-road tracks, creating a unique and challenging route. Thanks so much to Johan and company for putting on this event. I was pleasantly surprised to get the new FKT, but I don&#8217;t expect it will last very long!</p>
