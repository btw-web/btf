<p>The Utah Mixed Epic, or UME for short, is a challenging self-supported off-road bike adventure. Traveling through the visual spectacles bestowed to the Beehive State, it&#8217;s not a ride to be taken lightly. Filled with healthy doses of hike-a-bike, chunky trails, sand, slick-rock (and yes, even some fast gravel), forward progress is not so easily earned. </p>
<p>Utah is already a destination for bikepacking adventures, with a plethora of established multi-day loops primarily in and around the southeastern deserts of the state. But, there are ample amounts of other great riding, including quiet high alpine forests and expansive barren deserts on the western edge of the state. The UME compiles a wide mix of ecosystems and landscapes together in a patchwork of sensory expansion. </p>

<p>The 2021 route included nearly 80,000 feet of climbing. It traversed seven mountain ranges and two desert regions. To minimize as much vehicle interaction as possible, the route favored less-trafficked off-road paths. Utah is the land of ATVs, OHVs, big trucks, and fifth wheel traffic, so the selective use of roads and trails, in addition to careful timing of passage, was critical to maintaining the serenity of just you and your bicycle. </p>

<p>Resupplies were far and few between, bastions of civilization that ran hours, if not days, apart. Endless climbs and hours of riding stood between riders and a warm shower or food resupply. Water could be hit and miss, especially after a dry summer in the Mountain West. Every effort would need to be made to ensure that each rider had enough food and water to get them through the lonely stretches.</p>

<p>The ideal time for passage through Utah is early fall before the high mountains receive their first helpings of the world&#8217;s best snow, and after the low deserts have cooled down. Weather could change in an instant, and each ecosystem brought its own climate. High winds, extreme temperatures, and unrideable clay-based mud were just a few of the ever-present variables for riders to stay aware of. The previous iteration saw 100°F temperature swings, 100-year wind storms, and choking wildfire smoke. Riders had to be prepared for anything. It can sometimes become a race against the storm. If the storm wins, it can lead to the route becoming unrideable. Riders at the tail end of the pack had to face alpine storms with lightning and cold temperatures. One rider even faced leaving his bike in the mud to come back and free it another day.</p>
<p>This year, a total of 32 riders took a shot at traversing the state on a 957-mile route from Salt Lake City to Moab. The Grand Depart was September 24th, with 22 men and 10 women at the start. Of the 32 who came out this September, 17 were able to complete the route (53%, up from 33% the year before). </p>

<p>Each day on the route is easily over 10,000 feet of climbing on terrain that could bruise and batter the hardiest of humans. “Full body riding” is an apt description. A hardtail with plush tires was de rigueur, although some did dare roll on fully rigid drop-bar rigs. Though no matter the choice of bike, riders would end up taking it for a walk. This terrain was chosen to showcase the state&#8217;s subtle yet brutal ruggedness. The sights you see along the way are absolutely spectacular, especially with what had to be put in to earn them. </p>

<p>The UME is a suggested route for a congregation of like-minded individuals to ride, not race, via self-supported means. There are no prizes, no support, no accommodations for any rider. The reward is challenging yourself and the experiences and sights along the way. This ride follows Tour Divide rules. Self-support is emphasized to keep an equal experience for all of the riders. </p>

<p>Some chose to challenge themselves in a manner of riding the route as fast as possible. Dylan Morton posted the fastest male time this year at 7 days, 16 hours, 38 minutes (7:16:38). Jackie Baker posted the fastest female time of 9 days, 8 hours, 38 minutes (9:8:38) and sixth fastest overall. Though it&#8217;s not a race, some riders love the thrill of pushing themselves to the limit.</p>
