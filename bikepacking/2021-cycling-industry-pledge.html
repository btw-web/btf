<h1>Cycling Industry Pledge Enrollment Now Open</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://radicaladventureriders.com/cip" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cycling Industry Pledge</a> (CIP) from Radical Adventure Riders (RAR) works to hold companies accountable to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in the cycling community with signees making a commitment to actions outlined in the pledge. Enrollment is now open until Friday, April 30th!</p>
<p>In 2020, there were 249 companies that committed to the Cycling Industry Pledge. RAR is now looking to you in building a more resilient cycling industry for 2021. By joining CIP, all members receive core benefits, with an addition of the new benefits below.</p>
<h2>New Cycling Industry Pledge Benefits</h2>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Accountability &#038; Networking:</strong> RAR will offer an accountability group for companies who want a working group to share their pledge progress. RAR will also provide one-on-one connections for those who want to get in touch with similar-sized companies.</li>
<li><strong>Exposure &#038; Job Promotion:</strong> Paid members get access to up to two job announcements via our website and social media. RAR will also feature your company logo on our website and social media when we highlight signees.</li>
<li><strong>RAR Community Connection:</strong> RAR offers you additional networking opportunities with our community through RAR’s newsletter and programs. When requested, RAR can directly connect you to our Chapters, Gravel, and Scholarship programs.</li>
</ul>
<div class="ad"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a membership cost for 2021 because RAR believes that the work that goes into CIP should be acknowledged as paid labor. The cost to join the CIP Network is based on your number of full-time equivalent employees. RAR offers a pay-what-you-can option but encourages folks to use the following levels as a baseline.</p>
<h2>2021 Cycling Industry Pledge Costs</h2>
<div class="twocol">
<ul class="arrow-list">
<li>1 employee: $50</li>
<li>2-5 employees: $100</li>
<li>6-10 employees: $150</li>
<li>11-35 employees: $200</li>
<li>36-100 employees: $250</li>
<li>101-500 employees: $300</li>
<li>501+ employees: $400</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The CIP Network aims to foster empathy, understanding, and eagerness for the growth necessary to make progress toward true equity in cycling spaces. By signing CIP, you are taking an active role in that progress. You join a network that cheers each other on, holds each other accountable, shares information and education, and reminds one another of why we are all here. </p>
<p>It is time for companies to make a long-term commitment towards meaningful change. The 2020 CIP Survey Key Findings indicated that meaningful action still needs to come from within the cycling industry.</p>
