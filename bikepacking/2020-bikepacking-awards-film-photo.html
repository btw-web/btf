<h1>2020 Bikepacking Awards: Film, Photography, Writing, and Art</h1>
<p>To recognize all that’s been accomplished in the bikepacking community this year, here&#8217;s our second of three retrospectives honoring the individuals, teams, brands, and products we believe had the biggest impact in 2020. <a href="/gear/2020-bikepacking-gear-of-the-year/">Part one was all about the gear of the year</a>, and part two looks at the films, photographs, writing, and creative expressions that have inspired our community and kept the stoke alive during this trying year. We’re recognizing the efforts that have shown viewers magical parts of our world both near and far, encouraged folks to creatively document their own rides, or simply allowed the rest of us to share in the journey. </p>
<p>Without further delay, here are the awards for what we consider to be the most inspiring films, photography, writing, and art. Most categories feature three winners delineated by gold, silver, and bronze badges. These are ordered by vote count from seven of our editors and closest contributors who submitted blind ballots based on nearly one hundred nominations. In addition, find a Collective Choice award for Best Film with votes from the <a href="/join">Bikepacking Collective</a>, our member community. </p>
<p>We won’t deny wrestling over each decision, and every entry deserves applause, so please take some time to admire and enjoy their efforts, just as we have. </p>
