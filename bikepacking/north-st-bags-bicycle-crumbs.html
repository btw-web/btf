<h1>North St. Bags X Bicycle Crumbs Collaboration</h1>
<p><strong>&#8220;Why does all of cycling think that Hi-Vis has to be neon yellow?” &#8211; <a href="https://instagram.com/bicyclecrumbs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@bicyclecrumbs</a></strong></p>
<p>North St. Bags and Bicycle Crumbs, Portland-based neighbours, have teamed up to bring the first ever rainbow flip-flop sequin hip-pack and zipper bag. North St. explains, &#8220;We gave the Pioneer 12 Hip Pack and Pittock Pouch you know and love the flip/flop rainbow sequin fabric treatment you never knew you needed. These limited edition bags are available for preorder now, until September 26th, and will not exist after that. So, if you need more rainbows in your life, you better act fast. The Rainbow Sequin Pioneer 12 hip-pack is priced at $104.99, and the zipper pouch is $29.99. </p>

<p>To keep things interesting, Bicycle Crumbs also designed a new limited edition print for North St. Bags that is available on a few of their favourite bags; the Pioneer 12, Davis Daypack, Micro Pannier, and Pittock Pouch. The &#8216;Signature Print&#8217; is made from 1000d Cordura and cotton Dogwood Denim with that Bicycle Crumbs flavor you know and love. Like the rainbow sequins, the limited edition print is available for pre-order now through September 26th. The Signature Print hip-pack and zipper pouch will be priced the same as the sequin version, the Micro Pannier is $99.99, and the Signature Davis Daypack is $129.99. </p>
