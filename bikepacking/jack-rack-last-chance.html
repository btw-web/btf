<h1>Jack the Rack is 3,700% Funded!</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ll take credit for knowing Jack was going to be a hit, but I never imagined it becoming one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns I&#8217;ve ever seen. It&#8217;s been wild following their campaign over the last month. Jack is a versatile, handlebar-mounted front rack that’s secured in place using just two straps. It&#8217;s a clever product from UK-based WholeGrain Cycles, which is led by Miles Gibbons and Luke Cardew. For those who missed it, we got our hands on a pre-production version of Jack and put together <a href="https://bikepacking.com/gear/jack-bike-rack-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a full review here</a>. </p>
<div class="ad"></div>
<p>The Jack Kickstarter has been live for 29 days now, with just two days left to submit a pledge and be one of the first to receive Jack. Within a few hours of launching the campaign, all of the early-bird supporter slots were taken and the campaign was open to the general public. In less than 24 hours it was 1,200% funded, surpassing £80,000 in pledge value, and things weren&#8217;t slowing down. They had over 2,000 backers within the first 10 days, adding the option for a slick black coloured Jack or the classic finish. Things kept moving along, and by the halfway point WholeGrain Cycles announced plans to include environmentally friendly materials and a new custom aluminum carabiner as their third stretch goal. As of yesterday, October 28th, they need about 300 more backers to reach that goal, raising a total of £237,486 of an original goal of £6,400. Impressive, to say the least. </p>

<p>The team is finalizing Jack&#8217;s production and spent some time in the factory passing over the final design based on tester feedback, as well as their own tweaks. Once the final sample is produced and signed off on, they will start the production of everyone&#8217;s racks. Backers are expected to receive Jack in April 2022. </p>
<p><em>If you&#8217;ve got any questions on compatibility, design, or how the campaign works, head over to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/milesgibbons/jack-the-bike-rack/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their Kickstarter</a> and check out the FAQ section, comments, and the updates they&#8217;ve made along the way. The majority of questions have already been asked.</em></p>
