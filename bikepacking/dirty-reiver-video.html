<h1>The Dirty Reiver (Video): Bikepackers Testing Gravel</h1>
<p><em>Event photos by <a href="http://instagram.com/talesontyres" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Franzi Wernsing</a>, rider portraits by <a href="http://instagram.com/getwildmatty" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Matty Waudby</a></em></p>
<p>The Dirty Reiver 200 (200km) and Dirty One Thirty (130km) are off-road cycling challenges based on the gravel grinder format found predominantly in the midwestern United States. As with other gravel events, the Dirty Reiver has a lot in common with bikepacking group rides and races — a similar supportive camaraderie, long, punishing days in the saddle, and good times with bikes on abandoned two-track. Two different companies, Bombtrack and Ortlieb, created videos to capture the spirit of the event. Further down, you&#8217;ll find some thoughts on the race by several people in the bikepacking world.</p>

<h3>Matty Waudby (<a href="http://instagram.com/getwildmatty" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@getwildmatty</a>)</h3>
<p>“The Dirty Reiver has an air of mystique around it, and I found it made me question myself. Could I do the distance? Would I do it in a reasonable time? Was my head up to the challenge? I normally take a very relaxed approach to my riding, stopping at interesting things, taking photos, and chatting to locals. This is the vibe I prefer on an extended trip, I&#8217;d rather enjoy the moment than make the biggest mileage. I did a couple of training rides for the Reiver and found the hardest thing was to keep riding and not stop at a beautiful vista. A few friends and I did an overnighter to a bothy a few days before the event and it was great as the distance wasn&#8217;t too far and I could quench my thirst for photos, stories, a relaxing pace, and camping. </p>
<p>On the day of the event my intention was just to have fun and ride with everybody else. I soon found that my competitive side caught up with me and I got involved in all the overtaking and maneuvering at the start. This hampered me towards the end when I really began to struggle. I went into bikepacker mode, noticing all these awesome spots to pitch up for the night. Obviously I didn&#8217;t have my camping gear with me, but it made me consider doing the same route again over two days at a steadier pace with a bunch of friends. </p>
<p>I went tubeless on 650&#215;2.4 Continental tyres and they served me great. I think the ideal tyre is probably around 2.0 fast cross-country style and set up tubeless. Fast enough on the smooth gravel but importantly allowing you to monster truck the rugged descents. </p>
<p>I felt pretty beat at the end, but loved having a beer with everyone and cheering on the other finishers. It really is a great feeling coming up the last hill before the finish to have everyone cheering you on! I also swore I wouldn&#8217;t do it again straight after, but a few weeks later the bug is already there again. I&#8217;d like to do more gravel events, especially multi-day ones, but I&#8217;d probably aim for something like the Torino-Nice Rally or the Romagna Bike Trail and do a more leisurely pace with a few friends. The camaraderie with other riders during the event was awesome and it&#8217;s my main memory from the day.”</p>

<p>&#8220;The Dirty Reiver was my second gravel challenge, after riding the Dirty Boar in Belgium last year. Of course, such a ride is different to the bikepacking things I normally do. For the Dirty Reiver, I chose the Bombtrack Hook gravel bike, because it is faster and lighter than my usual bikepacking rig, the Bombtrack Beyond. I wasn’t scared by the distance (I&#8217;ve done much longer rides before), but I was bit scared by the elevation as I’ve never ridden 4000m of elevation in one day on gravel. I was definitely excited to ride this event, but I wasn’t there to race, I was there to ride, have fun, meet people, and make it to the finish line. Luckily, I had no mechanical problems, no punctures (I was on 40mm WTB Nanos with tubes), and I could ride the whole time. But, at a bit over 10hrs of riding, it was quite a tough day on the bike for me and I suffered a lot because of cramps all throughout my legs. Normally, I&#8217;m used to riding until I don’t want to ride anymore, taking breaks to eat and lie down when I feel like it – what you might call my ideal “bikepacking rhythm.” This time, though, it was definitely a different approach to riding, but it was a really good experience to discover that I can handle it as well. Maybe it was just the beer I had at the finish, but after the race I felt surprisingly good and was already dreaming of riding it again next year!&#8221;</p>

<h3>Franzi Wernsing (<a href="http://instagram.com/TalesOnTyres" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@TalesOnTyres</a>)</h3>
<p>“I have never attended anything like the Dirty Reiver before. Nor have I ridden 200km with 3500m of elevation in one day. Naturally, I felt a little nervous looking at the route beforehand, and that’s mainly why I decided to sign up for the shorter option, the Dirty One Thirty, a 130km loop. However, once I was in the saddle I became so captivated by spirit of the event, the supportive attitude between the riders, and the beauty of the landscape that I ended up riding the whole distance instead. Crossing the finish line after 12 hours on the bike felt exhilarating. Not only had I pushed myself beyond my own expectations, but I&#8217;d also gotten to share this experience with many other awesome people along the track. I think it’s always good to try new things, and in this case I got totally hooked on something I didn&#8217;t anticipate enjoying. Now I feel encouraged and curious to try out more challenges like this, and maybe I’d even try a multi-day challenge.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Jona Riechmann (<a href="http://instagram.com/TalesOnTyres" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@TalesOnTyres</a>)</h3>
<p>&#8220;I really enjoy riding long distances and pushing myself beyond my limits, which is why I&#8217;m planning to attend some multi-day bikepacking races this summer for the first time. The Dirt Reiver was a good test ride for me, as I’ve never done anything like this before. After traveling the world by bike at a leisurely pace for the last few years, focusing on pace and distance was a new experience for me. I usually ride a Bombtrack Beyond Plus which has such a different feel to the Bombtrack Hook 2 that I borrowed for the Dirty Reiver, but definitely loved riding a fast, unloaded bike for a change. I’m looking forward to more events like this!&#8221;</p>
