<h1>Friday Debrief: Colorful Parts, a Ti Wrench, Tour Aotearoa Grand Depart, and more</h1>
<p>We started &#8220;The Debrief&#8221; on our <a href="https://youtube.com/bikepackingcom?sub_confirmation=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> last year as a way of highlighting the week’s news and things that caught our attention on the website, in the conversation, and elsewhere around the community. To take this a step further, we’re posting a weekly Debrief here on the site to highlight all of those things and more, including upcoming events and interesting things our readers shared in the comments. Check out this week&#8217;s findings below.</p>
<h2>Bits &#038; Bobs</h2>
<p><em>New products that are worth highlighting but didn&#8217;t make the Dispatch&#8230;</em></p>
<h3>Forager Cycles Ti 8/10mm wrench</h3>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Forager-Ti-Wrench.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Forager-Ti-Wrench-960x640.jpg" alt="Forager Ti Wrench" width="960" height="640" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-117633" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Forager-Ti-Wrench-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Forager-Ti-Wrench-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Forager-Ti-Wrench-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Forager-Ti-Wrench.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a>
<p>Our friends over at Forager (maker of <a href="https://bikepacking.com/gear/forager-cycles-cable-cherries/">Cable Cherries</a>) just unveiled a grade 5 titanium 8/10mm wrench with valve core remover that&#8217;s small enough to fit into tight spots between racks and fenders but still long enough for some leverage. &#8220;Ideal for snugging up loose nuts and making trailside adjustments to the seat bag, fender stays, rack bolts, etc.,&#8221; as they put it. Nitto, Salsa, Tubus, and other rack builders use 10mm nuts. It&#8217;s not available yet, but stay tuned as it will be made in Nevada and available in April/May.</p>
<h3>Wolf Tooth&#8217;s Colorful Rotor Lockrings</h3>

<p>Wolf Tooth released a rainbow of Centerlock Rotor Lockrings earlier this week, each compatible with 12mm, 15mm, and 20mm thru-axles and QR. They&#8217;re machined from 7075-T6 aluminum in Minnesota and available in eight colors to match other Wolf Tooth anodized color accents for headsets, bolts, and seatpost clamps.</p>

<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nua-Roure_2.jpeg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nua-Roure_2-960x640.jpeg" alt="Nua Roure" width="960" height="640" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-117611" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nua-Roure_2-960x640.jpeg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nua-Roure_2-512x341.jpeg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nua-Roure_2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nua-Roure_2-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nua-Roure_2.jpeg 1960w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a>
<p>With nearly 200 comments in the conversation section of the <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/atb-manifesto/">ATB Manifesto</a> we published earlier this week, we got some very interesting suggestions. One of which was <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/atb-manifesto/#comment-5761978326">from Jimmy</a> who&#8217;s having a custom Nua Roure built as an ATB. We thought it was definitely worth sharing. </p>
<p>Based in Barcelona, Spain, Nua Bikes is a small bespoke builder focused on titanium bikes and internally geared drivetrains. Nua is the Catalan word for <em>nude</em>, which gets to the heart of their bicycle design philosophy. The Nua Roure is their &#8220;two-wheeled exploration vehicle&#8221; and is based on either a Pinion or Rohloff build featuring 27.5+ tires and loads of mounts, including a three-pack on each seat stay. Currently, all Nua bikes are custom-made to order and frames are custom-sized to fit the owner. The Nua Roure is available as a complete with a Rohloff starting at €4,600 or with a Pinion starting at €5,000.

<h3>Trek Sawyer with a Jones fork?</h3>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/reader-atb_1.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/reader-atb_1-960x640.jpg" alt="ATB" width="960" height="640" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-117762" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/reader-atb_1-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/reader-atb_1-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/reader-atb_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/reader-atb_1.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a>
<p>Another reader, Kyle K., left a photo of their ATB in the same conversation thread (<a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/atb-manifesto/#comment-5760509693">here</a>). While we&#8217;re not quite sure what it is, it looks quite unique, complete with a truss fork and Hite-rite &#8220;dropper.&#8221; One of us guessed a Trek Sawyer with a Jones fork. Anybody else want to take a shot at identifying it?</p>

<h3>Brother In the Wild BIPOC Tickets</h3>

<p>At last year&#8217;s Brother in the Wild, <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/inside-wizard-works/">Harry and Vee from Wizard Works</a> hosted a fireside panel discussion on inclusivity within the cycling world. &#8220;Those that attended know how powerful and engaging this fireside conversation was to listen to, and we don’t want this talk to be the only action we take to make things better,&#8221; said Brother Cycles. This year, to continue working to increase diversity at their events, they&#8217;ve held 30 extra tickets for POC/BAME riders to attend BITW Dorset (May 13 to 15th), as general release tickets sold out in the blink of an eye. Tickets for POC/BAME riders can be accessed via the link below.</p>

<p>The 3,000-kilometer Tour Aotearoa starts today! Riders must finish the route from Cape Reinga, at top of New Zealand, to Bluff at the bottom in 30 days. It&#8217;s a brevet, not a race. Riding conditions vary from rough singletrack, to beaches, to dirt roads, gravel roads, sealed roads, cycle lanes, trails and paths, and five boat trips. This year&#8217;s grand depart starts at 7:30 a.m. in waves of 100 people per day—there are currently more than 300 riders registered to participate. <a href="https://bikepacking.com/event/2022-tour-aotearoa/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Follow along live here</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been seeing a lot of imagery from southern Arizona this week, what with Sarah Swallow’s recent Sky Islands Adventure Ride series, and news that my buddy Jay Ritchey from <a href="https://bikepacking.com/gear/bags-by-bird-piccolo-review/">BXB</a> is about to have a shop warming party in Tucson. So I wish I was there too, cruising around those quiet desert dirt roads, camping out, and maybe trying Lael Wilcox’ recently posted <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/redington-lemmon-loop/">Redington-Lemmon Loop</a>. Since riding the AZT over a decade ago, I’ve always wanted to go back up to Mount Lemmon, and this looks like the perfect overnighter to do so. Now, where’s that gravel bike&#8230;</p>
