<h1>Introducing Moose Packs: Made in North Carolina</h1>
<p>Moose Packs was founded in 2015 in Boone, North Carolina, by Matt Moosa. Although their product line is still small at this point, we&#8217;ve heard good things about their handlebar bags. All of their products are made in small batches by Matt, and when is demand is high, they&#8217;ll contract some of the work out to another trusted US-based manufacturer. Moose Packs has made it their mission to source their materials domestically and plans to incorporate ECOPAK into their products in 2021. They also partner with 1% for the Planet and donate their time and earnings to North Carolina based non-profits.</p>
<p>I shot Matt a few questions to learn more about Moose Packs and where they&#8217;re heading. Find that below, followed by specs on their flagship product, the Moose Packs Handlebar Bag.</p>
<div class="ad"></div>
<p class='qa q'>How big is the Moose Packs team currently?</p>
<p>Our team consists of three employees, three ambassadors, and one dog! Katherine and I are currently the only full-time employees. Geoff works freelance on our website and other graphic design. Our Ambassadors are our go-to for current and new product feedback. </p>

<p class='qa q'>Tell us about your shop. Where is it and what does it look like?</p>
<p>We are based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and we currently run everything out of my home. I am in need of more room and will hopefully move the home office to a larger space in the mountains before too long. We would love to have a small pop up or store front / workshop in the future.</p>
<p class='qa q'>Are there any exciting products in development that you can tell us about?</p>
<p>We currently have handlebar bags and seat bags on the website. Future products will consist of half frame bags that are made to order, feed bags, recycled totes, and duffel bags.</p>

<p class='qa q'>For our readers in North Carolina, do you have a favourite place to ride?</p>
<p>Our favorite place to ride is Wilson Creek, a section of Pisgah National Forest. There is gravel for days and the mountain bike riding has the most technical and raw trails NC has to offer. Not to mention the bikepacking scene along the Blue Ridge Parkway from NC &#8211; VA  is amazing! It offers many scenic views and really cool small towns along the way. </p>

<h2>Moose Packs Handlebar Bag</h2>
<p>The Handlebar Bag is Moose Packs&#8217; flagship product, a simple burrito-style bag for easy access to items on unloaded rides. It&#8217;s constructed from burly 1000D Cordura, has a front daisy chain for light attachment, and the zipper pull has a sneaky integrated whistle. Moose Packs also offers a custom program, which allows for three different exterior colors for $115 USD. </p>
