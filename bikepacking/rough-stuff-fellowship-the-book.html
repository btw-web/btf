<h1>Rough-Stuff Fellowship: The Book</h1>
<p>Founded in 1955, by &#8220;forty members who, in pursuit of their pastime, traverse the rougher and less beaten ways,&#8221; the Rough-Stuff Fellowship is the world’s oldest off-road cycling club. Members of the RSF undertook the first ever bicycle crossing of Iceland’s interior in 1958, and have tackled other such rugged tracks in Europe, Africa, America, and beyond. A few months ago, RSF started releasing its scanned archival photos on Instagram, and the results have been captivating. Their archive contains thousands of images, hand-drawn maps, and documents. and RSF just announced a Kickstarter campaign—one that&#8217;s already 100% funded—to publish a book of these photos. Here are the details.</p>

<p>From Kickstarter: &#8220;The photos are evocative of a bygone age and a bygone style – a time when you might set off on a bike ride wearing a shirt and tie or a bobble hat, and no ride was complete without a stop to brew up some tea and smoke a pipe. They are also a record of intrepid adventures. RSF riders explored the Lake District, the Cairngorms, the Alps, and further afield, and their exploits were beautifully documented by amateur and professional photographers. In their own very British way, these men and women were pioneers, pedalling and carrying their bikes where angels feared to tread. Mountain bikes, gravel bikes, adventure bikes all owe them a debt. This book celebrates their style and their spirit. It is a stunning visual resource of cycling heritage that will inspire new adventures.&#8221;</p>
