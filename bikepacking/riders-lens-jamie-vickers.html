<p><em>Words and drawings by Jamie Vickers (<a href="http://www.instagram.com/wanderingscribbles/">@wanderingscribbles</a>)</em></p>
<p>Commuting, touring, or just riding, the bicycle has played a pivotal role in my life. &#8220;Professionally&#8221; I find work as a hand drawn animator and storyboard artist. Which is often long hours of grinding desk work.  Around 2005, after a number of chronic spinal injuries while working in Japan I decided I didn&#8217;t want to spend the rest of my life behind a desk. From that point a daily Yoga practice and cycling sort of took over my life. I still loved drawing though and continued to work, just not with the same blind intensity. I began thinking of a someway I could integrate all my interests, and still be happy, healthy, and be able to pay bills. </p>

<p>At some point I started taking longer amounts of time off between jobs. Riding more, sketching more, focusing on what interests me most. Taking these necessary breaks has been a huge stress reliever. So after doing a few short touring trips in the states, and a number of backpacking trips abroad, I decided to take my bike (Hima-chan) back to Japan, roll south to Kyushu, fly to Vietnam, and start cycling through Asia with a sketchbook on-board. Sure why not, that&#8217;s easy enough right? The plan was to sketch everyday while riding. This proved to be more difficult than I realized, for one it&#8217;s not easy to sketch and ride a bike at the same time. This led to settling into some places a bit longer than I would have otherwise. But it was cool, I got to to know people and the places a little better. It&#8217;s been a really therapeutic experience, sketching life while traveling by bicycle. </p>

<p>I try to find something interesting to draw no matter where I am, even if I&#8217;m in a seemingly boring environment. As an animator though, my eye naturally gravitates towards people. The challenge of capturing the character of a person is most interesting to me and when captured well, the most satisfying.  Drawing buildings, or landscapes can sometimes be a struggle for me. I almost have to find the character in the structure in order for it to capture my interest. Lately I&#8217;ve been trying to sketch out whole scene, putting it all in a context. The sketchbook sort of becomes a camera.  Snapping a photo would be a whole lot easier, but you know, it&#8217;s not just the captured image, it&#8217;s the process, and the experience of standing there, watching life go by and recording it on the paper. </p>

<h4>Gear and Tools</h4>
<p>Regarding my gear, before leaving I made a frame bag, was pretty happy that I was able to pull that off.  It worked out really well aside from two points: X-pac material is durable, but no where near monsoon level waterproof. Also, under enough stress, zippers will always fail. I&#8217;m now redesigning my frame bag to a roll-top design. Looking to Porcelain Rocket&#8217;s design for inspiration. </p>
<p>Another great use for the frame bag was to carry a sketchbook in. That way whenever I saw something or wanted to stop and draw, it was always right there between my legs. A frame bag I think works best for flat rectangular objects. Perfect for a sketchbook, pens and pencils.  </p>

<p>So far it&#8217;s been an amazing experience. One interesting and very satisfying outcome has been the realization that people value a drawing. It may seem obvious but when you&#8217;re working in an animation studio, your drawing doesn&#8217;t always feel valued so much. Everyone else around you is drawing &#8211; the same thing you are. It&#8217;s just part of the job. Staying on schedule is usually more important.  You can easily feel like a shadow in the machine. On the other hand sketching outside, for example &#8211; in Laos I drew a man weaving baskets on the side of the road. After he saw me sketching, wondering what I was doing there for so long, He&#8217;s curiously walked over to me, and after seeing the drawing and the smile on his face, I had to give the sketch to him. Dude was so happy. This happened a number of times. If I stayed with a village family I&#8217;d give them a drawing before leaving. And for the first time in a long time I felt like I had something to offer that made others happy. This has been an extremely powerful, and motivating part of the experience, it&#8217;s helped to open my eyes to other possibilities at home and abroad.  </p>
<p>I plan to keep up the sketching and traveling, compiling it all into a book&#8230; at some point. Work, ride and draw, repeat. </p>

<p>So this drawing was from outside Bok Bok Bike in Bangkok. I got to know the guys there pretty well during multiple visits. It&#8217;s really a haven for touring cyclists. Specializing (obviously) in Rohloff service and Surly frames, both of which I was rolling with. Inside the shop it&#8217;s little bigger than a walk-in closet and packed full. Work often pours onto the sidewalk outside. It&#8217;s something you don&#8217;t see much of in the west. It&#8217;s very Thailand.  So this evening I felt inspired and started drawing the shop and the guys there. I sometimes use a distorted 3/4 down perspective. They joked that that&#8217;s my point of view, I&#8217;m tall but I&#8217;m not this tall.  Also you&#8217;ll see on the right, a few doors down is another touring shop/cafe called The Touring Boy. A damn good group of people here. Always happy to help a cyclist and share some stories over a beer. Good times. </p>
