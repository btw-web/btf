<h1>Sour Announces Big Fun + German-Made Frames</h1>
<p>Dresden-based Sour Bicycles (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sour.bicycles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@sour.bicycles</a>) just announced their newest model, the Big Fun, a handmade steel 29er frame with clearance for 2.6&#8243; tires that&#8217;s long, low, and slack, and designed to be paired with a 140 to 160mm suspension fork. Picking up where their Crumble and Pasta Party mountain bike models leave off, Sour wrote us with the following to describe the new Big Fun, &#8220;We whipped up our new dropouts designed for ease of use for cold hands at high altitudes, and gave the entire frame a once over to add all the new hits you’ve come to know from the Pasta Party and other new frames. The headtube has been beefed up, tire clearance turned to 11, and suspension travel has been upped to heavy-hitter levels. This bike is ready for whatever you dare drop into.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Made-in-Germany Sour MTBs</h2>
<p>Following the &#8220;Homebrew&#8221; teaser video they released last week, Sour just revealed their biggest news to date: as of 2022, they&#8217;ll be moving all of their mountain bike production from Taiwan to Germany. In a post on their website, they stated that the production know-how and high level of build quality first led them to Taiwan for their frames, but COVID-related issues including supply chain breakdowns and increased lead times motivated them to reassess the possibility of producing frames in Europe. Given that they weren&#8217;t able to find a European manufacturer they thought could match the quality of craftsmanship coming out of Taiwan, they decided to move production in-house, right in Dresden, to have complete control over the finished product and the time necessary to create it. </p>
