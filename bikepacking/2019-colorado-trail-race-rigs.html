<div class="ad"></div>
<h3>JASON WINKLER</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 44 / MORRISON, CO (USA)</h4>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-jason-winkler.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-jason-winkler-960x640.jpg" alt="Rigs of the 2019 Colorado Trail Race" width="960" height="640" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-59626" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-jason-winkler-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-jason-winkler-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-jason-winkler-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-jason-winkler-2000x1334.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">THE BIKE:</strong> I will be riding a 2016 Salsa Beargrease fatbike with a custom painted (by me) Rock Shox Bluto 120mm travel fork that I color matched to the frame color, Maxxis Minion FBR and FBF 26 x 2.4&#8243; tires set up tubeless, SRAM Eagle 1&#215;12 with an Absolute Black 32 tooth oval chainring and 10-50 cassette, SRAM Decendent carbon cranks with DUB bottom bracket graciously donated by a good friend, Crank Brothers Candy pedals with custom stainless steel bearings and titanium axles, 70mm Whiskey carbon No.7 wheels with Industry Nine hubs, full carbon saddle, Whiskey carbon seat post, 820mm wide Race Face Six C bar with 35mm clamp, Shimano XT brakes with 160mm rotors and Ice Tech pads, and Salsa foam grips.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> I am using a combination of Bedrock Bags: seat bag, gas tank (but placed back at the seat post), BOT specific downtube bag, and SPOT holder. Also using a Revelate Salsa specific frame bag and Sweet Roll handlebar bag and a Novarra Map bag with a transparent top for maps located on the top of the stem.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> I really like my Bedrock Bags BOT specific bag with the BOT because the BOT is so useful for carrying water and/or gear and tucks away down low on the frame next to the chainring. The Bedrock Bags SPOT holder is also a great way to carry the SPOT tracker on the bike. I also really like my Sea to Summit SP Spark Sleeping bag and my Sierra Designs Flashlight 1FL tent because they are so small and lightweight and provide lots of comfort when camping. I also carry an MSR Whisperlite stove because I like to have hot food and tea along the way for that little extra bit of comfort.</p>
<h3>Scott Sidener</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 48 / Lexington, SC (390ft) (USA)</h4>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Scott-Sidener.jpeg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Scott-Sidener-960x640.jpeg" alt="Rigs of the 2019 Colorado Trail Race" width="960" height="640" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-59630" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Scott-Sidener-960x640.jpeg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Scott-Sidener-512x341.jpeg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Scott-Sidener-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Scott-Sidener.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">THE BIKE:</strong> Modified titanium Salsa Mukluk single speed fat bike<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> Long story: Savannah Bigboy is Dine, of the Edgewater Clan. She was raised in the Four Corners area in Cortez, Colorado. Both her grandmothers weaving contributed to her style of painting. They taught her what it was to be an artist and a Dine woman. She is a traveler, wandering soul, and an artist. In preparation for CTR this year, I decided design and fabricate my 4th generation of Dyneema Composite Fabric (DCF, aka Cuben Fiber) race packs. I wanted to do something very special with these bags. Given how much the area and landscape has touched my soul, I wanted these packs to have a design created by, and representing, the Native American people and culture of the area. Savannah created a beautiful painting for me. Titled “Hummingbird in Flowers”, it represents a hummingbird in flowers in the desert at night with the stars above and the earth below it. Given the constraints of the design of the bags, I couldn’t truly represent the beauty of Savannah’s original work, however, I hope I was able to honor her creativity and intent. I had custom DCF fabric printed from her original painting and used it to create these packs.I am so excited to have and represent her beautiful and meaningful work as I embark upon my journey across the Colorado trail in a few weeks. I am truly honored to be bringing these with me this year. In my mind, the hummingbird will be coming with me and maybe, just maybe, I can fly light and fast through the nights like a hummingbird and be at one with this journey.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> Prototype kLite front light, personally designed prototype charging electronics packed into a gutted Garmin external battery pod.  The whole charging system is very efficient and uses a custom designed cache battery that switches between the bike in daylight and the helmet light at night. You can also see my prototype “fishing rod holder” on the front fork :)</p>
<h3>Joshua Peter</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 28 / Denver, CO (USA)</h4>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Joshua-Peter.jpeg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Joshua-Peter-960x640.jpeg" alt="Rigs of the 2019 Colorado Trail Race" width="960" height="640" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-59628" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Joshua-Peter-960x640.jpeg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Joshua-Peter-512x341.jpeg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Joshua-Peter-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Joshua-Peter-2000x1333.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">THE BIKE:</strong> I&#8217;ll be rollin&#8217; a Trek Mustache with WTB 3.0 tough casing Rangers and a 26T chainring.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> I&#8217;m running a collection of bags. The Bedrock Bags Moab Handlebar, a custom frame bag from Bedrock Bags, a gas tank from Andrew the Maker, and a few from Revelate Designs.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> The piece I&#8217;m most excited about is my Bedrock Bags Moab Handlebar bag. This thing is a one of a kind gem. It packs a ton of my stuff and relocates the weight of the bag so well that it&#8217;s hardly even noticeable while riding. Besides that, I&#8217;m super stoked about that frame bag Tony&#8217;s Chocolonely Bar and jar of almond butter I&#8217;ll have stashed away which you know is gonna be breakfast one day.</p>
<h3>Artec Durham</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 33 / Flagstaff, AZ (USA)</h4>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Artec-Durham.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Artec-Durham-960x648.jpg" alt="Rigs of the 2019 Colorado Trail Race" width="960" height="648" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-59624" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Artec-Durham-960x648.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Artec-Durham-512x346.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Artec-Durham-768x518.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Artec-Durham.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">THE BIKE:</strong>  My bike of choise for the Colorado Trail is a Kona Hei Hei DL 29er with a Maxxis Ardent Race 2.35 in front and a Aspen 2.25 in rear. The Hei Hei is nice and slack with a 68 degree HT angle and has a Fox 34 120mm fork for a more Trail Bike feel, complete with a 6&#8243; droper post (of which I will be able to use 4&#8243;). Drivetrain is Sram 12 speed with a 32T oval front chain ring. This will be my third time riding the Coloardo Trail on a Hei Hei, I think it&#8217;s the perfect michine for the task, remember 70k of climbing means 70k of decending!<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> The Hei Hei is fited with custum bags made by Rogue Panda Designs right here in my home town of Flagstaff, AZ.  I particulary like the Zebra print top tube bag! For hydration I will be using the new Bismarck Bottle Bucket by Rogue Panda with a 1L bottle. With an aditional 1L bottle on the fork I wont have to carry any water on my back.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> I&#8217;m in Love with my Sea to Summit Aeros Pillow, although some people think bringing a pillow on the CTR is rediculous, they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re missing! For a shelter I will be using a Big Agnes Fly Creek UL1.  For navigation I’ll be carrying an eTrex 30, with a backup track on my phone.</p>
<h3>Joe Tonsager</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 37 / Denver, Colorado (USA)</h4>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Joe-Tonsager.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Joe-Tonsager-960x640.jpg" alt="Rigs of the 2019 Colorado Trail Race" width="960" height="640" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-59627" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Joe-Tonsager-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Joe-Tonsager-512x342.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Joe-Tonsager-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Joe-Tonsager.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">THE BIKE:</strong> I&#8217;ll be pedaling a 2019 Salsa Horsethief down the Colorado Trail. 29&#215;2.6 DHR II up front and 29&#215;2.5 Agressor rear. Industry Nine Backcountry 360 wheelset w/ Hydra hubs. Eagle 1&#215;11 with 28T elliptical chainring, ESI grips and SQlabs saddle. Rockshox 140mm Pike up front.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> All handmade in Colorado by me, JPaks! A full set of JPaks including: Dropper SeatPak, FramePak, FarvaPak, RukSaks and a custom H-BarPak and downtube BattPak. No backpack needed with the extra frame space Salsa squeezed out of the new Horsetheif. The highlight being the custom bolt-in FramePak that utilizes the stock H2O mounts and some adhesive velcro to hold in in place and has storage for daaaays! 70oz hydration bladder in the FramePak and 1 bottle on the stem.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> Black Diamond bipod bivy for shelter with Seat to Summit Micro MCII down sleeping bag and pillow. No ground pad. A small Primus stove and Salsa ti mug will accompany me this trip for those cold, rainy afternoons and mornings. Also carrying a Limefuel 20,000mah cache battery, Light and motion Trail FC1000 light as well as Black Diamond Icon headlamp and a Garmin Edge 810 for Nav.

<h3>Eric Morton</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 36 / Salida, CO (USA)</h4>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Eric-Morton.jpeg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Eric-Morton-960x626.jpeg" alt="Rigs of the 2019 Colorado Trail Race" width="960" height="626" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-59625" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Eric-Morton-960x626.jpeg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Eric-Morton-512x334.jpeg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Eric-Morton-768x501.jpeg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Eric-Morton.jpeg 1168w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">THE BIKE:</strong> 2019 Santa Cruz BlurC, GX Eagle build and a 28 oval chainring. (23 lbs unloaded/42 lbs loaded with food &#038; water)<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> Centerpiece is a custom Jpaks frame bag and custom Jpaks “fat” Barrito. Everything else is OvejaNegra. (Might run a RockGeist Gondola if I need more dropper post room)<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> Sleeping setup stays super compact and light with an Enlightened Equipment quilt, custom RockGeist bug bivvy, and Big Agnes AXL Air.   And so I have warm coffee and soup, I’m taking an ultralight Ti cooking setup at only .78 lbs. </p>
<h3>Max Milburn</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 30 / Jackson, WY (USA)</h4>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Max-Milburn.jpeg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Max-Milburn-960x641.jpeg" alt="Rigs of the 2019 Colorado Trail Race" width="960" height="641" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-59629" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Max-Milburn-960x641.jpeg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Max-Milburn-512x342.jpeg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Max-Milburn-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Colorado-Trail-Race-Rigs-Max-Milburn.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">THE BIKE:</strong> I call my bike Nintendo 65 (I pretend I’m in a video game when I bikepack) Its a 2017 Specialized Stumpjumper running  27.5 x 3”  Ikon tires. Eagle 1&#215;12 drivetrain. Ergon cork grips modified to allow Cane Creek bar ends. Ive got a Son Dynamo With a Sinewave Beacon attached.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> Custom Rockgeist fame bag. Salsa top tube. Revelate seat pack, jerrycan, and 2x mtn feedbags.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> A cool feature of my bike is all the stash spots. I can fill my downtube with stuff by accessing the hollow space through a little door where a waterbottle cage is traditionally mounted. In there I put all the things I hope not to use (tubes, repair, first aid.) I have a SWAT multitool that clips directly to the bike via a plastic bracket above the rear shock. My chain breaker tool hides inside the stem cap. I think these features are totally awesome, but I’m a giant nerd.  Ill be bringing the Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 1 Bikepack tent attached to the handlebars, and a full Neo Air sleeping pad.</p>
