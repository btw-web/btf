<h1>6k Schwalbe Mondial review: The ultimate bike touring tires, except…</h1>
<p>I have been tweaking Gin&#8217;s Troll and piecing together my next dirt-friendly touring build and have been obsessing with bike touring tires… again. She&#8217;ll be running her existing set that consists of one lone XR (the Mondial&#8217;s predecessor) and a one Mondial. Both 2&#8243; wide. But I have to acquire some new rubber in the 29&#8243; variety. In the process I started studying my Mondials, how they held up and reflecting on how they performed on dirt and gravel. Here are my thoughts:</p>
<h2>The ride on Pavement</h2>
<p>I can hark back to my first ride impressions of the tire. Before I bought them I was running classic Schwalbe Marathons (1.75&#8243;) and I was fairly certain that putting 2.15&#8243; wide and more heavily lugged Mondials on my Troll would make it feel, well, more trollish. </p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>The Mondials impressed me immediately at how well they rolled. The rubber on the Mondials feels slightly softer than that of the Marathons, and the XRs, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to affect the rolling speed. The Dureme is the other offering from Schwalbe that is popular with touring cyclists. Mike took a pair on his recent Europe excursion. In a nutshell, he preferred them for how well they rolled on a road-oriented tour, but they also seem to wear faster. In his words, &#8220;I liked everything about the Duremes but was surprised how quickly the rear wore.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The ride offroad</h2>
<p>The now defunct, but legendary, XRs were known to be slightly skidish on dirt and gravel. The Mondials have improved on their weakness with a tweaked rubber compound and about the same amount of tooth on the outer tread. For the most part the outer tread is what counts on off-road tires. It&#8217;s what grips on turns and catches the right places amongst loose terrain. Although most of the dirt and gravel riding I have done with Mondials has been fully loaded, there have been a few occasions where I pushed it a little. The Mondial rubber seems to grip surprisingly well. One thing I noticed on several occasions is that when riding on uneven slippery dirt or gravel, they seem to hold a line instead of sliding or shifting down. Even in sand they were able to plow through unless it got too deep. They certainly don&#8217;t have the balls-to-the-wall cornering capability of a Nevegal, but if you are mixing it up with dirt and gravel, they are a great option. Especially when durability and wear is important.</p>
<h2>Wear</h2>
<p>OK, this is the tire&#8217;s Magnum Opus. I met a German fellow who had over 12,000 kms on his and they were still in great condition. I have somewhere around 6k on mine and they are alive and well. The amount of tread wear on the tires is barely noticeable… even on the rear. I had intended on rotating them halfway in the trip but didn&#8217;t see a reason too upon further inspection at the time. I would guess that unless a shard of glass took them out, I could pull another 12-16k, easily.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you are in the market for a set of tires for your next tour, especially if it&#8217;s a long one, these are your tires. If you are looking for a set to perform well on a tour of mixed terrain, with gravel, some dirt and pavement, I think the Mondials are perfect. If you have a 29er and need a larger width tire&#8230; sorry, they don&#8217;t have them in sizes other than 26&#8243; and 700c x 40c or 35c. That is the one problem with the almost perfect Mondial. Dear Schwalbe, please make a 29 x 2.25&#8243; version&#8230;</p>
<p><em>EDIT: from the comment below, &#8216;phlatphrog&#8217; brought to light that they do make a 29er version of the Mondial in a 2&#8243; width (50-622), and there is a 1.75&#8243; width version as well (47-622). I was ignorant to the fact that 29er/700c tires are called 28&#8243; when referring to them in the good ole Imperial system.</em></p>
<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list">
<li>Unbelievable durability</li>
<li>Very little wear even after hard riding through Mexico and Central American gravel</li>
<li>Very flat resistant</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list">
<li>Heavy: 26 x 2.15&#8243; weigh in at 865 grams</li>
<li>No offerings in larger 29&#8243; models <em>(larger than 2&#8243; width)</em></li>
</ul>
