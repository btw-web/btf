<h1>Tulum to Bacalar: Coastal Bike Touring at its Best</h1>
<p>With our friends Alex and Catherine coming to meet us in Caye Caulker it was time to start heading south from our sandy tipi village in Tulum. Our route would take us along the barrier islands to the fishing village of Punta Allen. From there we would cross over to the mainland and ride through the Sian Ka&#8217;an Biosphere reserve and on to the Mayan town of Fellipe Carrillo Puerto before rejoining the highway that would take us to Laguna Bacular. This would be our final stop on the way to Chetumal where we will catch the ferry into Belize. This stretch of riding would bring us our longest distance in a day and for me some of the most scenic and unique rides. It would, however, present us with the unexpected challenge of the most difficult riding conditions so far.</p>

<div class="caption">As we got further into the jungle the roads became unexpectedly slick and there were numerous wrecks between us.
