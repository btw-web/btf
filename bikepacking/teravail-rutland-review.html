<h1>Teravail Rutland Review: Monstre Gravier</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve ridden a bike with tires smaller than 2.0&#8243; wide, and that&#8217;s fine by me. Over the past couple of years, I&#8217;ve come to the opinion that even gravel bikes should have big tires—a sentiment that&#8217;s manifested in the 2.1&#8243; minimum clearance used as a metric in our indexes of drop-bar <a href="/index/650b-gravel-bikes/">650b</a> and <a href="/index/drop-bar-mountain-bikes-29er/">29er</a> rigs. </p>
<p>I completely understand why 38-45mm tires are the choice for many, but for me, the extra cushion is crucial for comfort and reduced fatigue for long rides. Fortunately, there are now quite a few MTB tire options over 2.0&#8243; that aren&#8217;t just for mountain biking. Some are even being marketed specifically for mixed surface sub-niche styles of riding. The new 700c x 47mm, 27.5 x 2.1&#8243;, and 29 x 2.2&#8243; Teravail Rutland tires embrace this concept wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>Prior to these size additions, the Teravail Rutland was only offered in 700c x 38/42mm and 650b x 47mm. Despite the fact that these are gravel/all-road category sizes, Teravail positioned the Rutland as a <em>mixed terrain tire</em>. Their marketing lede sums it up with, &#8220;Designed with the unknown in mind, the Rutland takes the guess work out of selecting the right tire for the ride.&#8221; Some might argue that the larger iterations of the Rutland aren&#8217;t really for a gravel bike at all, but I digress. Bikes that come to mind for these tires include the likes of the Salsa Cutthroat, Sutra LTD, and MOOTS Baxter, which as far as I&#8217;m concerned, are perfect gravel bikes, and about as gravel as I care to get. </p>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Teravail-Rutland-Review_16.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Teravail-Rutland-Review_16-2000x1333.jpg" alt="Teravail Rutland Review, 29 x 2.2" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-75163" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Teravail-Rutland-Review_16-2000x1333.jpg 2000w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Teravail-Rutland-Review_16-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Teravail-Rutland-Review_16-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Teravail-Rutland-Review_16-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Teravail-Rutland-Review_16-1536x1024.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a>
<p>All that said, I love the fact that Teravail specs the Rutland as a relatively category-less tire. After all, category definitions are often more befuddling than clarifying. Not too long ago I had someone stop me on a local trail. He was on an XC-oriented Trek hardtail and noticed my frame-bag equipped hardtail (which was actually more of an aggressive trail bike with heavily lugged trail tires). He looked it over and said &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking about getting a gravel bike, too. I&#8217;d love do the Great Divide Trail out west. I&#8217;ve never done anything like that, but it looks exciting.&#8221; I told him that the bike he had would be perfect for it, and that the bike I had wasn&#8217;t really a gravel bike at all. He kind of looked puzzled, but given that we were trying to keep our social distance, I didn&#8217;t delve too much deeper and carried on down the trail. All that&#8217;s neither here nor there with this tire review, but my point is that the term <em>gravel</em> often seems to be misappropriated and confusing. I suppose my version of gravel involves a faster pace via pavement to access some actual gravel with the option to hop on some rough two-track and manageable singletrack, all while staying relatively comfortable, going much faster than I would on my trail bike, and enjoying the nuances of drop-handlebars. The tires I&#8217;ve gravitated toward for this type of riding include the 2.2&#8243; Teravail Ehline, Schwalbe&#8217;s Rock Razor, the WTB Riddler, and the 2.25&#8243; Maxxis Rekon Race. What makes these four tires special is their fast-rolling center tread coupled with significant side knobs that allow me to corner with confidence—not really doable on a 38mm gravel tire, in my opinion. </p>

<p>All of the tires I mentioned above are categorized as XC mountain bike tires, however. Are they so different from the &#8220;mixed terrain&#8221; specced Teravail Rutland? Not really. Well, maybe a little. Similar to the Rekon Race, the new Teravail Rutland features ramped, tightly spaced center lugs to reduce rolling resistance. The Rutland&#8217;s very fast&#8230; faster than the 2.25&#8243; Rekon Race. I think this can be attributed to slightly smaller lugs and a more rounded profile, something prevalent in Teravail&#8217;s line. In fact, both the Sparwood and the Ehline have a notable rounded profile. Similar to the Ehline, I&#8217;ve found that running the Rutland at a lower tire pressure (about 21/22 PSI) helps keep them stable on loose and rubbly terrain. The deep profile also adds to these tires&#8217; suppleness.  </p>
<p>The Rutland also has very well placed, semi-aggressive shoulder and transition lugs to provide excellent cornering grip. On the trail, I&#8217;ve found it to feel nearly as confident as the Ehline, but a little more snappy, and significantly faster. The Rutland is about 10 steps ahead of the Sparwood for cornering confidence, in my opinion, and almost as fast. I&#8217;ve found the Sparwood to feel a bit squirrely in the corners and on loose surfaces. The shoulder lugs seem to do an excellent job in that regard. In the calipers, the 2.2&#8243; Rutland measures true-to-width at 55.9mm (2.20 inches) at the outer tread.</p>

<p>I asked Neil Beltchenko what he thought about these tires since he&#8217;s had a pair on his Cutthroat for the past two months. Here&#8217;s what he had to say: &#8220;After throwing a quick 700 mixed terrain miles on the new Rutland 2.2” over the last 6 weeks, I think I have a good idea of where this tire thrives. While it may not have the rolling capabilities of the Sparwood, the Rutland picks up where the Sparwood leaves off, making my Cutthroat a much more capable machine on tight and twisty singletrack. The well-designed tread pattern corners nicely over loose gravel, sheds mud as desired, and keeps me in line for confident climbing on steep grades. The Rutland gives me a better feel for the bike and seemingly knows no bounds paired with any big-clearance drop bar bike.&#8221;</em></p>

<h4>Wrap Up</h4>
<p>Having sought after the perfect XC MTB tire over the past couple of years for my personal breed of gravel bike, I&#8217;m happy to see brands embracing tires that fit this niche. Call it <em>monster gravel</em>, mixed terrain, or whatever you&#8217;d like, the fact of the matter is Teravail had this style of riding in mind when they revamped the Rutland with three wider sizes.</p>
<p>After a few rides, I&#8217;m quite impressed with the 29 x 2.2&#8243; Rutland. It&#8217;s very fast, supple, and holds its own in the corners. And with the same tread compound as its more aggressive sibling, the Ehline, it&#8217;s also quite sticky. I was very impressed on a couple steep climbs out of the saddle, both on rubbly gravel and litter-strewn singletrack. Only time will tell, but I also hope that the tread will hold up as well as that of the Ehline—the pair I used in Colombia is still in great condition after well over 1,000 miles of use.
