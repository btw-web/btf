<h1>Topeak Bikepacking Bags: Roundup Review</h1>
<p><em>Words and photos by John Stewart</em></p>
<p>Lately, we&#8217;re seeing more offerings for frame packs and other bags coming out of larger producers, many of whom are making bikepacking gear for the first time. Topeak is among the established brands that recently jumped into the bikepacking game. They’re well known for their quality accessory products and tools, and I was excited to see what how bags would stand up. Most of my experience with bag makers has been in the cottage industry, where attention to detail and customization is often the allure. Knowing that these bags were produced en masse, I was curious to see the quality of production. I’m happy to report that Topeak’s bags are well made and held up well in inclement weather.</p>

<p>I tested out their complete set of bags from October through February on commutes to work, long day rides into the mountains, as well as a few bikepacking trips. I was lucky enough to experience plenty of rain, snow, and everything in between. Here in Colorado, the shoulder seasons are great times to test gear because we can start the day with snow, have it warm up and melt, then have rain in the evening that goes on to freeze all over again. This gave me a great chance to find out just how waterproof Topeak’s Bikepacking Series bags really are.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: We used some images directly from Topeak (each main image); these show a slightly updated variation of the bags. The bags that were tested were an earlier version (shown in all other photos).</em></p>
<h2>Topeak TopLoader (Top Tube Bag)</h2>
<p>The TopLoader is a basic top tube bag with three points of attachment. It uses two velcro straps that wrap around the top tube and one that cinches around the head tube. The bag features a single zipper on top that moves easily with either hand. The TopLoader has a bright yellow interior liner, making it easy to see items inside, as well as an adjustable divider that attaches to the sides using velcro.</p>

<div class="twocol">
<div>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Three attachment points</strong> keep the bag secure.</li>
<li><strong>Performs well in foul weather</strong> when zipper is fully closed and in the zipper garage.</li>
<li><strong>Features a moveable/removable divider</strong> to change the layout of the bag.</li>
<li><strong>Includes an attached waterproof cover.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Zipper easily gets caught</strong> on the side of the zipper garage when closing quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Has some inconsistencies</strong> with the packing material used to increase stability (doesn’t affect function, just aesthetics).</li>
<li><strong>Mount to head tube</strong> is at the lower part of the bag and can lead to some sway with heavier items. Could be improved by having the mount strap higher on the headtube.</li>

<h2>Topeak MidLoader Frame Bag</h2>
<p>A “one size fits most” approach to a mid-size frame bag. The bag would likely fit well as the only frame pack for those running some full-suspension frames or smaller MTB frames. I was able to fit two bottles in my main triangle with the MidLoader installed on my large frame. The anchor points do an excellent job of keeping the bag securely fastened on the bike. The bag has two zippers, one on each side, that allow for quick access to the main pocket from either direction. The bag also has flaps to protect the zippers on both sides. There’s also a plastic insert near the front that helps the bag keep its shape.</p>

<h2>Topeak BackLoader Seat Bag</h2>
<p>While using the BackLoader, I experienced some issues with water creeping into the rolled up end, though no moisture ever made it all the way into the (included) interior dry bag. As the outer bag doesn’t seem particularly resistant to rain and slush, I found that it was best to have the dry bag handy in the event of precipitation. As an added bonus, the dry bag offers a great way to compress items packed into the BackLoader via its built-in air bleed valve. The seat attachment system is very similar to those found on other seat packs, employing two buckles to secure the back to the seat rails and two other buckles that are used compress and close the bag. Finessing the BackLoader’s large buckles through the seat rails did prove to be a bit cumbersome, however.</p>

<h2>Topeak FrontLoader Handlebar Bag</h2>
<p>The FrontLoader is a smaller harness system that mounts to the handlebar using a pair of crossing straps. The harness includes a dry bag with the same style of air bleed valve as the the one seen on the BackLoader. When compressed, the dry bag takes up a minimal amount of space and fits nicely into the harness, which uses buckles to tighten everything into place. That said, there’s a minimum packing threshold at which the dry bag will sit securely within the harness. If, for example, you only packed a super compressible down jacket into the dry bag, the harness likely wouldn’t be able to hang on to the dry bag very well. The front harness works well in the rain and snow. I didn’t experience any issues with winter weather leaking in during the months I was using it.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Holds up well</strong> against the elements.</li>
<li><strong>Harness and dry bag system</strong> keeps your gear securely in place.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Requires a minimum load</strong> to function properly.</li>
<li><strong>The mounting system uses two sets of straps,</strong> which seems like overkill. Simply using the cam straps would be sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Bag mounts directly to the bar</strong> which can make accessing brake levers/shifters more difficult.<em> NOTE: Topeak added foam inserts that now space the bag away from the bars.</em></li>

<h4>Wrap Up</h4>
<p>Overall, I found that these bags performed well in almost all areas. I didn’t experience any serious issues or deal breakers during my time with them. I could see these bags being a great starter set for a lot of bikepackers. The prices are more modest than that of the cottage bag makers, and the bags – when used as intended – held up well against Mother Nature. The attachment systems are not complicated and the bags offer ample space to carry gear and supplies for a multi-night trip. If the price point of these bag is within your comfort zone, I’d encourage you to give them a shot. I think you’ll find they do the trick. And while you’re out there, enjoy the ride!
