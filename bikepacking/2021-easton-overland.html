His writing, photography, and beautiful mug have been featured in <em>Broken and Coastal</em> and other publications; while his bike handling skills have also been a regular fixture in the PNW gravel and cyclocross scene. Adam will be repping the Orbea Terra.</p>

<h3>Caitlin Bernstein</h3>
<p>Easton was excited to introduce Caitlin (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/caitlincbernstein/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@caitlincbernstein</a>) as a new member in 2020, and that energy continues into 2021. Between her huge national presence in US Cyclocross, XC, and gravel, and her passion for waffles, she’s the perfect ambassador for Vermont maple syrup and sendy gravel. She continues to rep Devinci this year, with an endurance-focused 2x setup, and a 1x GRX dropper equipped spec for more aggressive Grinduro style events. </p>

<h3>Caroline Dezendorf</h3>
<p>At the beginning of 2020, Caro (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/caroline_dezie/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@caroline_dezie</a>) was slated to start the year coming in hot off an 8th place ranking in US cyclocross. As she pivoted to FKTs and exploring her new home in South Lake Tahoe, the goals have adapted and Easton is excited to see her kickstart the gravel season with that same enthusiasm in 2021. Caroline will be racing the highly adaptable Cervelo Aspero, with her 2x GRX Di2 setup taking on the primary role of endurance gravel for events.</p>

<h3>Craig Richey</h3>
<p>As Easton has before, Craig (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/craigrichey/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@craigrichey</a>) is their Swiss army knife, a competitive athlete who revels in the multiple formats of road and dirt cycling. Craig has a wealth of advice for those pursuing gravel events while balancing the full-time grind. His Devinci Hatchet builds will focus on the aggressive side of gravel, taking on 50mm tires and Easton&#8217;s more aggressive AX build kits to keep pace with his favorite Comox Valley singletrack on Vancouver Island.</p>

<h3>Emily Cheng</h3>
<p>Emily (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/alpinemily/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@alpinemily</a>) joins Easton Overland with a focus on slinging cameras, capturing bikepacking and adventure rides, and doing some extended gravel journalism. Her background in truly epic outdoor adventure photography will bring a new perspective to Overland and we’re excited to pair her keen eye with her gift for words. Emily is riding the Thesis OB1, which has been her do-it-all from Death Valley to the gravel near her San Francisco home.</p>

<h3>Matt Lieto</h3>
<p>Easton&#8217;s resident gravel veteran, Lieto (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/mattlieto/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@mattlieto</a>) has a breadth of on-the-ground event involvement, both in organizing and announcing, so make sure to tune in to his coverage of SBT GRVL! He’s also the team&#8217;s main expert on bone healing, and while they don’t revel in his recovery the past few months, they’re excited to have him share some tips from a professional cyclist on how to rebound from injury. Matt will be Easton&#8217;s second Cervelo athlete, with his Aspero rigs equipped to take on stage races like Oregon Trail and Rebecca’s Private Idaho.</p>
