<h1>Specialized 2FO ClipLite Review: What a Clipless Shoe Should Be</h1>
<p>To preface this review, it should be known that I have developed a nasty reputation in my household as one who breaks, damages, or otherwise ruins things. Clothing (riding or otherwise), shoes, seatposts, saddles, helmets&#8230;you name it, and I’ve brought on its untimely demise. This is, by no means, intentional. I just think that my rather hurried nature and distractibility, in concert with a touch of clumsiness, take their toll on things. That said, I’m pleased to report that after almost three years of consistent, and, at times, unconventional use, The Destroyer (yours truly) has met her match. The Specialized 2FO ClipLite shoes have proven to be extremely durable. Aside from one relatively innocuous defect (details to follow), the shoes are in great shape, and they perform and fit as well as they did when new. So, what about their the fit and performance? </p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>According to Specialized’s website, the Body Geometry sole construction and footbed <em>are ergonomically designed and scientifically tested to boost power, increase efficiency, and reduce chance of injury by optimizing hip, knee, and foot alignment.</em> I have no evidence to support nor contest the claims related to injury prevention (see note above regarding clumsiness), but the extended recessed cleat pocket offers 4mm of rear to aftward adjustment for the cleat mounts. The shoe’s rigid Lollipop™ nylon composite inner plate creates a nice stiff platform for efficient pedaling. </p>
<p>That efficiency and power transfer is also due, in part, to the secure fit of the 2FO. Each shoe has two Boa S2 dials that tighten the shoe in place. A Velcro strap is located closer to the toe box for added security. The S2 dials lack the quick release that other Boa dials offer, but, in my opinion, that just means one fewer potential mechanical failure. While I’m on the topic of the Boa dials, it’s time to confess. During the course of an awkward dismount and stumble, I dislodged the lower dial on my left shoe. At the time, it was fairly simple to replace, but it has subsequently fallen out and been lost. Fortunately, I’ve found that the absence of that dial hasn’t seemed to affect the shoe’s fit or performance, too much. If it had, replacement BOA dials and laces can be purchased.</p>

</ul>
<p>As any bikepacker knows, the pedaling efficiency that a shoe offers is just one factor in its overall performance. How a shoe handles potentially arduous hike-a-bikes is, in my opinion, at least as important. The sole of the shoe is, as previously stated, really stiff through the shank, but the forefoot is moderately flexible. In addition, the heel cup is depressed, which provides a nice secure fit with no heel lift. The soles of the 2FO are constructed from Specialized’s proprietary Slipnot rubber. The compound is not quite as grippy as that used in some flats, but it is much softer and offers more traction than the super rigid soles found on the bottom of most clipless shoes. The shoe also has added toe box protection. Another big plus for the 2FO is its performance in wet weather. The thermobonded upper and gusseted tongue help keep water and muddy debris out of the shoe. This waterproofing has been consistent after years of riding through puddles and a few thorough hosings. If I wade through a deep stream, my foot gets a little damp, but dries impressively quickly. Off the trails, the recessed cleat pocket protects the cleats and cuts out irritating clicking. </p>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Specialized-2FO-review_10.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Specialized-2FO-review_10-2000x1333.jpg" alt="Specialized 2FO Cliplite Review" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-44237" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Specialized-2FO-review_10-2000x1333.jpg 2000w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Specialized-2FO-review_10-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Specialized-2FO-review_10-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Specialized-2FO-review_10-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a>
<p>My one complaint about the shoe is most likely related to some anatomical issues in my foot and not a defect in the shoe itself. Despite a fairly wide toe box, I find that the lateral aspect of my pinky toenail rubs a little along the seam where the rubber and more breathable fabric of the uppers meet. The rub has lessened over time and is barely noticeable at this point. All in all, I’ve found these shoes to be amazingly comfortable, both on and off the bike… and even while gardening.</p>

<h4>Wrap Up</h4>
<p>Specialized’s 2FO Cliplite is the perfect cross between a flat and a racing shoe. Its stiff nylon shank and secure fit create solid power transfer for efficient pedaling, while its grippy sole and deep heel pocket provide comfort and stability during hikes. It’s also got the looks. While it’s not as hip as some skate-styled flats on the market, it’s a far cry from the ultra rigid, shiny astronaut-ish look of some clipless footwear. Best of all, the 2FO Cliplite is well made. After years of abuse, these shoes have held up incredibly well. And, given my record, that’s saying a whole lot.
