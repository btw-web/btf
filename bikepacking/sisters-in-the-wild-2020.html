<h1>Sisters in the Wild: Slovenia Meetup in September</h1>
<p><em>Our friend and regular contributor Neza Peterca (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/t.w.w.c/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@t.w.w.c</a>) just sent along this announcement about an event she&#8217;s organizing in Slovenia this fall. Find full details below, directly from Neza:</em></p>
<h3>Sisters in the Wild</h3>
<p>Many of us were told from an early age that we were not allowed or not able to do certain stuff, such as sports, occupations and life styles and it resonated with us into our adulthood. We have concerns about our abilities of doing and achieving certain things in life as women.</p>
<p>Some women who set out their goals, they just go and do it, but for many others it is not that simple.</p>
<p>Confidence is the key for stepping out of our comfort zone, but equally representation and influence from other women is important. Seeing other women doing something opens up for others to follow in a matter of: “if you will, I will!”</p>

<p>That’s why it is important to create a safe, supportive environment, where women are able to progress, gain confidence and learn from each other. To overcome barriers is to create an environment where we learn and engage with other women.  </p>
<p>Adventure by bike can be seen as a personal pursuit, but as we gain more experience we tend to share these moments with someone else. Just starting and finding the person to do it with is an incredibly intimidating part of it, therefore we tend to avoid it.</p>
<p>We all have different fears and barriers that are stopping up from getting out on our own adventure, but more we talk about them and share them with others, it makes them less intimidating, realizing we all struggle with them.</p>
<h4>Event Overview</h4>
<p>This event is striving for women to push themselves in an environment where they can feel comfortable, giving them the opportunity to face their personal challenges in a supportive, pressure free environment. It’s time for us to meet, share our experiences and link up with new riding companions. Sharing struggles, fears, tears and laughs. Support each other climbing up the hills, talk under the starry sky, cook meals and share recipes.</p>
<p>This is not a race, neither is it a riding event, but a community building experience.</p>
