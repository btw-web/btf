<h1>Rigs of the 2020 GBDURO + Event Recap</h1>
<p><em>Words by Ed Wolstenholme from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theracingcollective/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Racing Collective</a>, photos by <a href="https://breakawaydigital.co.uk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Breakaway Digital</a></em></p>
<p>A cosy glow spills from the windows of an isolated highland croft at dusk. The smell of beer and a hearty pub meal escaping out the front door of a country inn. Bangin’ bass lines and laughter heard through the open window of a remote house at 2:00 am on the Pennine Bridleway. These are the moments where choices are brought into sharp relief. I could be in that pub, at that party, or settling in for a good night’s sleep, but I’m not. I’m pursuing a notion, conquering a self imposed challenge just because, well, it seemed impossible.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where this year’s GBDURO sits. At first glance, riding 1,963 kilometres without resupply seems impossible. Of course it’s not—adventurous types trek to the poles dragging sufficient provisions for 90 days on a sled. There’s no shops on the Iditarod route and you’ll struggle for a SPAR at Everest base camp. This forces a shift of gear, a whole new mindset, and a self-reliance that endurance athletes are familiar with. Full self-sufficiency takes this further though. There’s no escaping the soaking chill of an unexpected thunderstorm in the embrace of a hot shower at a hotel. Dodgy stomach? You’d better get your trowel out and dig some catholes. There is no shoulder to cry on and you’d better know yourself very well because your food choices for today were made weeks ago.</p>

<p>But self-sufficient riding has a more important role than demanding better planning. It forces us to really consider consumption, the noun that sits at the centre of 21st century capitalist ideology. How much do we actually need? How much is enough? These questions are more easily answered when every gram slows the pace of our wheels. Less and lighter spells success. Every gram of excess packaging is wasted effort; it pays to minimise.</p>
<p>Moving from self-supported to self-sufficient riding requires a shift in mindset from ‘equal opportunity’ to ‘no assistance from others’. Kindness of strangers and resupplying at shops and pubs is fine under the self-supported ruleset, as is the disposal of as much waste as you like. Self-sufficient riding on the other hand, does not permit assistance from others, use of any buildings, or disposal of non-biodegradable waste. There’s a key test here: does it rely on assistance from others? If the answer is ‘yes’, then you’re not self-sufficient.</p>
<p>The move to self-sufficient riding produces less waste while cycling and finally addresses the eye-watering amounts of plastic waste that go straight in the bin during conventional ultracycling events.</p>

<p>On backcountry trips it is normal to pack out any packaging you carried in. The requirement to carry your waste out quickly turns our attention to how we can minimise the packaging in the first place, and we are starting to see the development of biodegradable packaging. COVID-19 or not, we want to shine a light on these advances and drive demand for further progress.</p>
<p>Big money cycling has for years relied on money from sponsors whose raison d&#8217;être is simply more. More stuff = more profit. Consider the 14 million items of landfill thrown from the caravan of the Tour d’France each year. Cheap trinkets to pass the time until the riders arrive, each of those riders supported by several team cars spewing CO2 into the atmosphere. A crash? It’s OK, just grab a spare bike and carry on. The consequences of the rider’s actions are focussed on their athletic performance and it is a poor metaphor for life.</p>
<p>We must learn to live within our means, and that means looking at everything we carry with us on our journey.</p>

<h2>Q&#038;A with 2020 GBDURO Winner Josh Ibbett</h2>
<p><em>Find a quick Q&#038;A from the GBDURO organizers with event winner, Josh Ibbett, followed by the rigs of the 2020 GBDURO below.</em></p>
<p class='qa q'>What originally attracted you to the event?</p>
<p>Initially, my plans were to return to the Tour Divide in 2020, however early in the year it became apparent that international travel was not going to be possible. GBDURO represented the most likely opportunity for me to be able to race this summer, and once the self-sufficiency rule was introduced it seemed even more likely that the event would be help in a responsible manner.</p>
<p class='qa q'>What were your thoughts when the self-sufficiency rules were introduced?</p>
<p>I was never super keen on the original format as I love the longer non-stop events, so I was super excited when the new rules were introduced. The self-sufficiency aspect added a whole new element of interest for me. I never thought it would be impossible, but enjoyed the problem solving process of figuring out how to do it. I also felt that holding the event in the original format would be irresponsible regardless of the UK lockdown status at the time, but being fully self-sufficient seemed to be a good compromise in order to hold some kind of event without causing too much risk of COVID transmission.</p>

<p class='qa q'>How did you prepare for this event differently compared to others?</p>
<p>Training wise I was not as fit as I have been before. My available training time was somewhat restricted due to COVID-19. I work at my family business and fortunately we were able to remain open throughout the UK lockdown, however this meant we were incredibly busy, which was extremely fortunate for real life, but it meant that I had to massively compromise the energy and time I was able to commit to my cycling life. However, I began working with a coach during this period (Transition Cycle Coaching), which enabled me to maximise the training I was able to do within my time constraints.</p>
<p class='qa q'>Is there anything you would change if you were to do it again?</p>
<p>The biggest change would be to take a little more variety in terms of food. I’d carry some wraps and a few tins of Tuna for a quicker lunch option and a more savoury option when needed. Apart from that I think I got things pretty dialled in. My experience is starting to pay off!</p>

</ul>
<p class='qa q'>What were your highlights (or lowlights) of the route?</p>
<p>The highlight was undoubtedly the northern half of Scotland, where there is such a vast array of terrain and a real feeling of wilderness. The lowlight was probably the first few days before I hit the hills in Wales. There was a lot of road, a lot of short sharp climbs, and not much wilderness. Overall it really is an exceptional route to ride.</p>
<p class='qa q'>Are there any elements of self-sufficiency that you&#8217;ll incorporate into your future racing?</p>
<p>Yes, it certainly opened my eyes as to what can be achieved. I have been wondering for a while if carrying a stove in the more remote races would be beneficial, and I think I may start to experiment.</p>
