<h1>REI Co-Op Cycles Bulks Up Their Bikepacking Line with the ADV 4.2</h1>
<p>Last year, REI, the largest outdoor co-op in the US, announced that it would drop Novara as its house bike line and unveiled the Co-Op Cycles brand along with a handful of mountain, gravel and touring bikes. Building off of a successful first year with the brand, Co-Op Cycles just introduced eight new bikes in the 2018 brand line-up. Four of which are in their &#8220;adventure touring&#8221; series (ADV), and designed for riders who enjoy multi-day, off-road adventures.</p>
<p>REI claims a long history as a go-to for passionate touring cyclists, who often have specific needs for their bikes and related gear. According to REI, the new ADV bikes build on that legacy and are &#8220;made for riders looking to take their adventures to the end of the pavement and onto the trail. The bikes can haul gear, carry packs and operate reliably – no matter the surface or distance.&#8221; Within their bikepacking lineup, which REI calls &#8220;Trail Touring&#8221;, there are two reworked bikes, the ADV 1.1 and 3.1, and two completely new bikes for 2018. </p>

<h2>REI Co-op Cycles ADV 4.2 (27.5+)</h2>
<p>The flagship bike in their 2018 ADV line — and the only one in the series of which they have released photos — is the Co-op Cycles ADV 4.2. Upon first glance, it&#8217;s a tank of a bike clearly made for carrying large loads over multi-day, dirt-road expeditions. Based on the photo, the bike features a rather impressive component spec, including 27.5 x 2.8 WTB Ranger+ TCS Tough tires, a wide-range 2&#215;11 Shimano’s SLX/XT drivetrain, front and rear racks, a Cane Creek Thudbuster seat post, and a Jones H-Bar handlebar. Although the geometry numbers have not been released, on first glance the ADV 4.2 has an aluminum frame that appears to be less aggressive than other bikes in the category, with a steep head angle and long chainstay more suitable for load-carrying, long-haul duties. The ADV 4.2 will retail for $1,899 and is likely compete with bikes such as the <a href="/bikes/2017-surly-ogre-review/">Surly Ogre</a> and new <a href="/news/2018-trek-1120-bikepacking-stache/">Trek 1120</a>.</p>
<h3>Other Co-op ADV Bikes</h3>
<p>The ADV 3.2 (not shown) is a drop-bar adventure bike &#8220;designed for rugged mileage and trail touring&#8221; according to Co-op Cycles. The ADV 3.2 features a triple butted aluminum frame and fork with 15mm thru-axle dropout, rack mounts, a Shimano Deore XT 2&#215;10 drivetrain with bar-end shifters, TRP Hylex hydraulic disc brakes and 650b 50mm Xplor MSO tires. The 3.2 will retail for $1,699.</p>
<p>The ADV 3.1 is a double-butted chromoly steel, drop-bar bike designed for dirt touring enthusiasts with a chromoly fork with 15mm thru-axle dropout, plenty of rack mounts, 2&#215;10 Shimano Deore drivetrain with bar-end shifters, mechanical disc brakes, and 650b 50mm Xplor MSO tires. The 3.1 will retail for $1,199.</p>
<p>The ADV 1.1 is a road bike designed for fully loaded road touring. It features a double butted chromoly frame, a chromoly fork with 15mm thru-axle dropout, Shimano Deore LX drivetrain with bar-end shifters and 700 x 38 touring tires, cable actuated hydraulic disc brakes and front and rear racks. It will sell for $1,299.</p>
<p>According to REI, Co-op cycles design inspiration is gleaned from members and employees who are passionate about backcountry outdoors pursuits. As such, Co-op Cycles leans into a “trail-first” approach with their mountain (DRT), all-road (ARD), and adventure (ADV) focused bikes&#8230; Learn more about <a href="http://www.rei.com/b/co-op-cycles" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Co-op Cycles here</a>.</p>
