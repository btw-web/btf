<h1>2019 Bikepacking Awards: People and Routes</h1>
<p>In parts one and two of our 2019 Bikepacking Awards, we showcased our choices for <a href="/gear/2019-gear-of-the-year/">Gear of The Year</a> and <a href="/plog/2019-bikepacking-awards-1/">Best Bikepacking Videos, Photography, Writing, and Art</a>. </p>
<p>For our final awards installment, we celebrate the people who have contributed to our community, whether through their physical achievements, the richness of their storytelling, or their commitment to spreading the word about bikepacking and related causes. Additionally, we both acknowledge and thank route makers by honoring everything from small but perfectly formed overnighter escapes to overseas odysseys. We’re thrilled to be able to share this growing resource and we couldn’t do so without our vibrant, inquisitive, and talented community. </p>
<p>Note that we looked at over 30 routes and six of us (Logan, Virginia, Lucas, Cass, Joe, and Miles) cast blind votes; the results are a direct tally of our votes, which were based on three criteria: 1. Which we&#8217;d like to ride most, 2. Originality/intent, and 3. Quality of documentation. Without further ado, let&#8217;s get on to the awards&#8230;</p>
<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Bikepacker of The Year</h2>
<p><em class="font-serif-ital" style='color:#323444;'>Our top award for 2019 goes to an individual who keeps inspiring us, time and again. </em></p>

<h2>Alexandera Houchin</h2>
<p>Many of you may have followed Alexandera in 2019 with her incredible wins in two of the biggest ultra-endurance races of the year: the Tour Divide and the Colorado Trail Race. But we don’t admire her simply for her achievements on the bike, though she’s undoubtedly a hero to countless people in that respect. She’s continually inspired us with her storytelling ability (including her piece &#8220;Ditibised&#8221; in the third issue of <em><a href="/join">The Bikepacking Journal</a></em>, strong personal character, and resounding humility. For these reasons, we can’t imagine a better person to recognize as our 2019 Bikepacker of the Year.</p>

<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Ambassadors of The Year</h2>
<p><em class="font-serif-ital" style='color:#323444;'>This award recognizes individuals who have helped propel bikepacking to the forefront of the outdoor community, and have made a positive impact through their pedal-powered projects.</em></p>

<h2>Ben Weaver and Keenan DesPlanques</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2018, musician and poet <a href="/bikes/ben-weaver-salsa-blackborow/">Ben Weaver</a> and filmmaker Keenan DesPlanques took on the Tour Divide route from Banff, Alberta, Canada to Antelope Wells, New Mexico, for their Music For Free tour. They rode with instruments and camera gear, stopping along the route for 16 scheduled performances and adding in shows as opportunity allowed. This year, Ben and Keenan released their film, <em>Music For Free</em>, which documents their journey, explores wilderness, what it means to be wild, and examines the common denominators we all hold dear as humans sharing this planet. This film is a shining example of what it means to be out experiencing the world by bike. Had it not been for its limited public release (and an oversight on our part), it would likely have been on the top of the Film/Photo awards. Congrats, Ben and Keenan&#8230; well deserved on all fronts.</p>
<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Explorers of The Year</h2>
<p><em class="font-serif-ital" style='color:#323444;'>This award is dedicated to the intrepid few who’ve set out to experience diverse corners of the world, both across the globe and close to home, and have thoughtfully shared their stories with the rest of us.</em></p>

<h2>Jesse Carlsson and Sarah Hammond</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, Australians Jesse Carlsson and Sarah Hammond of <a href="/plog/inside-curve-cycling/">Curve Cycling</a> left their ordinary lives behind when they gave away nearly everything they owned, moved out of their house, and started living off their bikes for their <a href="/plog/sell-everything-live-off-a-bike/">Tent is the New Rent</a> project. They&#8217;ve been experimenting with flipping the traditional work week, working two days and riding five each week. Jesse and Sarah have also been busy scouting out the route for the <a href="https://www.rhinorun.cc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rhino Run</a>, a 2,750km gravel race across Namibia and South Africa that will take place in November 2020. All the while, Jesse managed to sneak in another <a href="/news/teaser-race-rock-documentary/">Race to the Rock</a> win, and the pair have led bikepackers on guided trips around southern Australia, South Africa, and across Lesotho. Look for more from Jesse and Sarah in the year ahead.</p>

<h4>Huw Oliver and Annie Le</h4>
<p>
It&#8217;s been yet another action-packed year for Huw Oliver and Annie Le, who&#8217;ve continued to inspire us us with their travels through Scotland&#8217;s Cairngorm Mountains, but have also been spotted as far from home as <a href="/news/adventure-syndicate-colorado-trail-video/">Colorado</a> and Alaska. And as always, there&#8217;s a thoughtfulness that permeates the <a href="/plog/broken-road-film/">films</a>, photos, and <a href="/stories/boundless/">writing</a> they share. We look forward to following their bikerafting and riding exploits in the year to come, and hope to be able to publish more of their work.

<h4>Sarah Swallow</h4>
<p>
We&#8217;ve had a nearly impossible time keeping up with Sarah Swallow this year. The <a href="/plan/wtf-bikexplorers-lessons/">WTF Bikexplorers</a> co-founder has been busy riding her bike in a range of far-off locales, including Bolivia, Slovenia, Peru, and Croatia. Closer to home, Sarah has also worked to map out several <a href="/author/the-swallows/">exciting routes</a> and raise awareness of the environmental and humanitarian injustices that are occurring in the southern Arizona borderlands, specifically through organizing the <a href="/news/2020-ruta-del-jefe/">Ruta del Jefe</a> gravel race and ride.

<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Ultra-achievers of The Year</h2>
<p><em class="font-serif-ital" style='color:#323444;'>This award is for individuals who compete in and advance ultra-endurance bikepacking as a competitive sport and a personal challenge. This year, continuing a rather unconventional selection, we chose to highlight not only the fastest record setters, but those doing things slightly differently.</em></p>

<h2>Jonas Deichmann</h2>
<p>Judging by the sheer numbers, it&#8217;s easy to see why Jonas Deichmann&#8217;s accomplishment made our top spot in this category. The German-born athlete and speaker recently set the new record for fastest time between North Cape, Norway, and Cape Town, South Africa, riding an extraordinary 18,000 kilometers in just over 72 days.

<h4>Fiona Kolbinger</h4>
<p>
Fiona Kolbinger, a 24-year-old German cancer researcher, won the seventh edition of the <a href="/news/fiona-kolbinger-wins-2019-transcontinental-race-no7/">Transcontinental Race</a> this August. She rode over 4,000 km from Burgas, Bulgaria, to the finish line at Brest in Brittany, in northwest France, in just ​10 days, 2 hours, and 48 minutes (10:02:48). What a feat!</div>

<h4>Chris Seistrup</h4>
<p>
Chris Seistrup, a 38-year-old from Prescott, Arizona, not only won the 2019 <a href="/news/chris-seistrup-2019-tour-divide/">Tour Divide</a> (15:11:24) as a rookie—a very impressive race time considering the conditions this year—but accomplished his goal of becoming the first person with hemophilia to ride the entire Tour Divide route.</div>

<h2>Camino Del Puma</h2>
<p>Sparsely populated, diverse in landscapes, and rich in culture and history, the southwestern corner of Peru is a remarkable region to tour by bike. The Camino Del Puma follows a high-elevation route from Arequipa to Lago Titicaca and back. Forming a 1,255 km loop, the route weaves through the colorful landscapes of Peru’s dramatic Central Volcanic Zone, rolls easily along the sunny plains surrounding sparkling Lago Titicaca, skirts the arid northern margin of the Atacama Desert, and dives into one of the country’s deepest canyons, connecting an interesting string of remote towns and pueblitos. <a href="/routes/el-camino-de-la-puma/">View our route guide here</a>.</p>

<p>
The GB Divide route runs the length of Britain, linking its wild places with its rich industrial past. Riders will experience a diverse range of geographies and micro cultures to give them a unique perspective of the rich history that has shaped the British Isles. Bursting with climbs and technical descents, expect road, gravel, singletrack, and everything in between. <a href="/routes/gb-divide/">View the route guide here</a>.</div>
