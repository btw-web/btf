<h1>Rigs of the 2021 Trans North Georgia Adventure (TNGA)</h1>
<p>The Trans North Georgia Adventure (TNGA) is a 350-mile mountain bike route across northern Georgia on trails, featuring challenging terrain, beautiful scenery, and a whole lot of climbing—over 50,000 feet, as claimed by race organizers. The route snakes through the southern Appalachian mountains from South Carolina to Alabama, following a variety of riding surfaces including smooth and chunky gravel, pavement, root-strewn singletrack, rocky ridgeline trails, abandoned roadbeds, and the occasional bushwhack. Between steep, quad-wrenching climbs and screaming descents, there are even rail-grade flat sections. The TNGA throws in a little bit of everything. </p>
<p>The current fastest known time is held by 25-year-old James Dunaway of Dahlonega, Georgia, who just completed the route in 1 day, 16 hours, and 54 minutes (1d:16:54). And last year, Jakub Jiracek set a new singlespeed record of 60 hours. There are no entry fees, prizes, or podiums, but you can bet someone will be gunning for a course record this year nonetheless.</p>
<p>The 2021 TNGA has nearly 120 riders registered on Trackleaders, with staggered starts from August 20th to 22nd and some others taking on individual time trials around the same time (<a href="https://bikepacking.com/news/follow-the-2021-tnga/">read up on how to follow it here</a>). As always, we’ve worked with the participants of this year’s event to collect bike and gear info for more than 50 riders who are tackling the route. Scroll through and get a good look at everyone’s rig and then head over to the <a href="https://bikepacking.com/tracker/2021tnga/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2021 TNGA event Tracker page</a> to follow along live.</p>

<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> 2021 Salsa Timberjack running 1&#215;11 with 32t up front and an 11-46t in the rear. Vittoria Barzo 29&#215;2.25 for tires. Ergon grips and SMC Core saddle. Water bottle cages mounted to the fork and a 1L Nalgene on the downtube.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> I have a mix of Bedrock and Revelate bags. For Bedrock, I have a custom frame bag, Black Dragon dropper seat bag, Honaker downtube bag. For Revelate, I have a Sweetroll along with a Jerrycan, Feedbag, and Mag-Tank.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> I&#8217;ll be sleeping in a Big Agnes Copper Spur tent and using a Wahoo Elemnt Bolt for navigation.</p>

<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> Doing my first TNGA attempt on a Transition Spur from Southern Carnage. My favorite highlights here are the Why Cycles Ti handlebar (so comfortable!) and the blacked-out decals. 10-52 cassette with 32T chainring for all the range! Not pictured are the cork Ergon grips and strap to hold that bottle under the downtube on tight, woo!<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> Acepac: saddle bag w/ dry bag and handlebar bottle bag, Relevate Designs: Mountain Feedbag, Jerrycan, and Magtank, and the EVOC BOA handlebar bag in Large.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> Nemo Astro 25l sleeping pad, REI shell Bivy, Two Sea-to-Summit pillows (side sleeper), flip-flips, tick remover, and a Ti spork I just got for my birthday from my friends Brandon and Teri. </p>
<h2 class="font-sans-bold">Brian Lord</h2>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 35 / Greenville, South Carolina (USA)</h4>

<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> My first TNGA will be attempted on my single speed 2020 Specialized Fuse “Uno” 29 with 32&#215;22 gearing. The slack head tube angle and 130mm fork are perfect for the rowdy singletrack. For grip and speed, I am running a 2.3” Specialized Ground Control up front and a 2.3” Specialized Fast Trak in the rear wrapped to a set of Industry Nine Enduro S 1/1 wheels. An extra bottle cage is hose-clamped to the top tube.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> My favorite piece is the custom frame bag from Greenville local Zac Webb/Spare Cycling with custom “rhodo” print designed by me! Revelate Designs completes the rest of the kit with a small Sweet Roll bar bag, Terrapin seat bag, Gas Tank top tube bag, and two bar-mounted feed bags.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> My sleep system consists of an Outdoor Research Helium bivy and small foam pad. Aftershokz headphones keep me grooving on the never-ending climbs while my bar-mounted rubber duckie keeps me company.</p>
<h2 class="font-sans-bold">Ben Frauenthal</h2>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 25 / Richmond, Virginia (USA)</h4>

<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> I&#8217;ll be riding the TNGA on my steel Chumba Terlingua. My rubber of choice is a 2.3&#8243; Specialized Fast track in the front and the rear is a 1.95&#8243; Specialized Renegade, which I&#8217;m pretty sure is a discontinued size. Shifting will be done with SRAM Force 1&#215;11 and a 32T chainring. Lighting and power is brought to you by an SP-7 hub in combination with a Sinewave Beacon.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> I&#8217;ll be running an Apidura handlebar bag, Road Runner Co-pilot feedbag, Salsa HT frame bag, Specialized Top Tube Pack, and an Ortlieb saddlebag.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> A 4iii left side power meter will keep me in check during the first day and the 2L bladder in my frame bag will keep me slurpin&#8217; into the night. Big thanks to @gratstagram for helping me take pictures. </p>
<h2 class="font-sans-bold">Nani d&#8217;Ettorre</h2>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 45 / Marietta, Georgia (USA)</h4>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nani-dEttorre-2021-TNGA.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nani-dEttorre-2021-TNGA-2000x1333.jpg" alt="Nani d&#039;Ettorre 2021 TNGA" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-104006" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nani-dEttorre-2021-TNGA-2000x1333.jpg 2000w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nani-dEttorre-2021-TNGA-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nani-dEttorre-2021-TNGA-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nani-dEttorre-2021-TNGA-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Nani-dEttorre-2021-TNGA-1536x1024.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> I’ll be riding the TNGA 2021 on a 2021 Nordest Britango Frame I built for bikepacking earlier this year. The bike runs on I9 Trail Wheels with Forekasters, A GX/XX1 Sram Copper Drivetrain (52t) with a 28T chairing (yup, I need all the help in the climbs!), and a Chris King BB, so it can survive all the creek crossings. Since the bike&#8217;s geometry allowed me to, I installed 140mm of travel in the front, so it&#8217;s ready to have fun at local trails after TNGA! With the bike industry shortage, it took me five months to piece this bike together, but I could not be happier with it. I was able to pick all everything I would want on a hardtail, and I can tell when I ride it, loaded or not.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> I have a combination of Rogue Panda and Revelate bags. My favorite one is the full frame custom Rogue Panda. They were able to customize a side pocket that would fit my 1.5-liter bladder perfectly. I also run Rogue Panda top tube bags, down tube bag, and feeders. My seat bag and front roll system are from Revelate, and I am a huge fan of the harness/roll bag combo for nighttime and morning set up.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> This might be my favorite thing I got for the TNGA, an Tarpent Aeon Li tent. I was originally planning on hammock camping, and after a couple of unsuccessful attempts, I got this tent. Best decision ever. As a newer rider (I have never participated in a bikepacking event, EVER!), my goal is to finish. So, I am more touring/party pacing this thing than racing it and sleeping well is key for me to enjoy my first TNGA.</p>
<h2 class="font-sans-bold">Jean Miller</h2>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 54 / Lawrenceville, Georgia (USA)</h4>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jean-Miller-2021-tnga.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jean-Miller-2021-tnga-2000x1333.jpg" alt="Jean Miller 2021 toga" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-103814" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jean-Miller-2021-tnga-2000x1333.jpg 2000w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jean-Miller-2021-tnga-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jean-Miller-2021-tnga-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jean-Miller-2021-tnga-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jean-Miller-2021-tnga-1536x1024.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> I’ll be riding the 2021 TNGA on a small Lynskey Livewire with a Fox Factory 32 shock and running Vittoria Mezcals on 29” boost wheels (2.35 front / 2.25 rear). The drivetrain is 1&#215;12 with a 32T chainring and 10T/52T cassette. My favorite addition to this bike build and a must for North Georgia singletrack has been a 120mm dropper post, though it has been challenging finding room for a seat pack on this tiny frame.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> I started with a custom Rockgeist frame bag with a flare nose – not as much room as I had hoped. I’m running a number of Revelate bags including two snack bags, two quarter-round bags, and the Shrew seat pack. I carry three water bottles, one on the downtube, one in a snack bag, and one on the right shock lower. Girl Hack: Use elastic hair bands to hold your water bottles in place on the down tube and fork.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> An SOL Escape Bivvy rolled up in a thin yoga mat and strapped to my handlebar will serve as my shelter and sleep system. I’m navigating with a Garmin 830 and my lighting system is Fenix helmet and handlebar lights.</p>
<h2 class="font-sans-bold">Rebekah Less</h2>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 29 / Warner Robins, Georgia (USA)</h4>

<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> 2018 Surly Krampus. Fully rigid frame with aluminum Spanks 29” wheels. Running 2.4” Maxxis Aggressor tires. Had some fun with blue and purple accents and have purple bars, purple spoke nipples, and purple top tube feed bag. I have blue wheels, blue cranks, blue step, and blue grips. Originally, this was my single speed bike, however, for the TNGA I added gears (I am not badass enough to ride the TNGA single speed). 1X12 SRAM GX drivetrain.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> Running all Revelate design bags. The frame bag is fit specifically for the Surly Krampus. I also have a Revelate Spinelock 10L seat bag, Sweetroll bar bag, Mag Tank top tube feed bag, and two Polecat bags on the fork. I only carry spare bottles of water in the Polecat bags.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> My Boyfriend and I are doing the TNGA together so we are splitting some of the gear. We have a two-person North Face tent that weighs under a pound and a collapsible GSI cook kit that are staples of any bikepacking trip. We have a Wahoo Bolt for navigation. In the true spirit of self-supported adventure riding, we have cooked and dehydrated most of our meals. My boyfriend and I both enjoy cooking and experimenting with food. For this year&#8217;s TNGA, we have cooked and dehydrated Quinoa Chili, Shepards Pie, Taco Mac&#038;Cheese, Loaded Potato Soup, Banana Chips, Beef Jerky, and Mango Chips. We will also be packing Oatmeal, Spam, and instant coffee for breakfasts. </p>

<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> As we (my girlfriend and I) are riding (not racing) the TNGA, we are packing some comfort items. Of particular note have inflatable Nemo pillows that make sleeping at night extremely comfortable. Additionally, my pair of Specialized Explorer bibs are a go-to for multi-day rides. Their numerous pockets allow for easy access to snacks and water. For additional snack storage, I especially like the Revelate Mountain Feedbag, which is also conveniently shaped to fit a tallBoy can. Lastly, my GSI flask is a must for some sips of bourbon before bed.  </p>

<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> This adjustable-capacity bag zips shut and is expertly made at a reasonable price. I will be using my ENO doublenest hammock and a light sleeping bag to catch some Zs. </p>
<h2 class="font-sans-bold">Victoria Kelley</h2>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 35 / Recently escaped from Western North Carolina (USA)</h4>

<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> Alloy Niner Air 9. Size small. Dropper post.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> This frame only has bosses/room for 1 bottle in the triangle. When I decided to use it for longer distances, I went to Rockgeist to make a custom frame bag to hold a water bladder. It holds a spare pair of socks, a light layer, chain lube, and personal care on the other side. The bag between my legs carries tools/etc. and the snack bag up front can hold almost half the calories I need to carry on this route at any given time. Jersey pockets hold the rest.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> My favorite thing about this bike is the 2x drivetrain. Big ring for fast gravel, little for singletrack, and small gaps between gears to tweak for efficiency. </p>

<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> I will be using a Rockgeist frame bag, Revelate cockpit, Speedsleev repair kit bag, and a BarBagz handlebar bag.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> I love the Ergon grips and saddle, as well as my little sticker near the seat tube. Singlespeeding will have its ups and downs but I am looking forward to the adventure the most!</p>

<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> 2018 Specialized Epic S-Works. I believe the comfort of the full-suspension more than makes up for the extra weight.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> All bags are Revelate Designs. This year I have added the handlebar bag to carry a NEMO Hornet 1 tent. The sleeping bag, blow-up mat, and cooker are in the Terrapin seat bag. The frame bag is filled with breakfasts and dinners.<br />

NOX Teocalli wheels. SON Dyno. Rohloff hub with Gates belt drive. Conti CrossKing. Crankbrothers Stamp (flats!), Jones Loop bars, Ergon grips, KLite lights, Fox 32 SC fork, Paul brakes and levers, Wolftooth side-by-side bottle mounts with King Cages. Not pictured: Selle SMP Pro saddle.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> My under-frame bag is homemade by a friend. Everything else is Rockgeist, they are awesome bags, and the spacelink is great.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> Wahoo Roam for Nav. Minimal sleep system-SOL bivy with Klymit X-Lite half-pad. Altra trail running shoes, great for my knees and feet, dry fast, great for hike-a-bike. Let&#8217;s do this! </p>
<h2 class="font-sans-bold">Dom Edwards</h2>

<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> 2021 Specialized Epic EVO; XT crankset; Wolftooth 32T oval chainring; Vitoria Mezcal 2.35” tires. Ergon grips with bar ends and aero bars to help ensure I can feel my hands at the end of this. Overall, the theme in equipment selection is to minimize unnecessary suffering.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> Bags are all Revelate Designs. Strayed from the old faithful Terrapin and went with the Shrew to enable use of the dropper post. RD Sweetroll makes up for that lost volume and preserves the use of bottle cages. Additional bags include a Jerry Can, Gas Tank, and two Mountain Feedbags.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> Most important piece of kit will be the 3&#215;3” prayer square that a lady from my church knitted and that my wife has been using while praying for TNGA success. Will also carry a picture of my friend who had hoped to ride this year, but is recovering from cancer surgery. In terms of more traditional gear, Wahoo Elment Bolt and eTrex 30x (“two is one…”) will show the way to Alabama. Fenix lights (PD-35 on the bars and HM65R helmet mount) because they enable quick battery changes. Eureka Suma tent because a bivy doesn’t work well for me; this tent is acceptably light, sets up quickly, and is freestanding. Sawyer Mini provides safe water. Specialized Rime 2.0 shoes because they dry relatively quickly and perform flawlessly on hike-a-bike sections, even on wet rocks. Luxury items are the Klymit inflatable pillow and sleeping pad.</p>

<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> I’m riding the TNGA on a 2021 Salsa Cutthroat (pink for safety!). My bike was crafted by Pat Patterson at Loose Nuts in Grant Park Atlanta, Georgia, and includes carbon wheels with an SP PD-8X dynamo hub, a 1 x 11 drivetrain with a 28 tooth chainring party up front, and a RockShox Reba fork to dampen the impact to my body from N GA mountains. I’ll be carrying four water bottles using two water bottle cages on the lower legs of my fork via four Topeak Versamounts. My saddle is a Fizik Antares R1 Open, which I have found to be most comfortable for longer days.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> From front to rear, an Egress Pocket for nutrition, two Mountain Feedbags for water bottles, a Mag Tank (bolt-on) for electronics and bits, a Jerry Can for some tools, and an older seat bag for clothing and (more) nutrition, all from Revelate Designs. My frame bag is Salsa’s EXP Series Direct Mount Cutthroat Frame Pack, which has a super clean mounting system via their thumb screws.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> I’m carrying both a Garmin eTrex 30 and Wahoo Elemnt Roam for navigation. I also use the RideWithGps app on my phone as another failsafe. Lastly, my remaining dynamo components are from kLite. The components consist of the kLite Bikepacker ULTRA V2 light, a kLite Bar Switch/wire loom V2, and a kLite DUAL USB charger to keep all my stuff topped off! Oh, and a well-used safety triangle purchased from Singletrack Samurai.</p>

<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> I’m riding a steel Ribble Adventure 725 GX Eagle 2020. Stock, I’m not too picky about details. The Ribble has taken a beating on some boulder-filled downhill Jeep trails and Blue Ridge scree, fully loaded. I have only good things to say.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> The frame bag is a custom by Choike and I’m really happy with it. It was out in a rainstorm one night and didn’t leak. The Apidura top tube bags have been totally submerged during a swim in a flooded river (oops), and they only slightly leaked, they are quality. Ribble had a deal on the Restrap seat and handlebar bags so I ordered them with the bike. They are heavier than I like, but very convenient and have never shaken loose. I have more volume than needed and may shed a bag before the ride.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> I’ve been loving a hammock for sleeping, using a UV purifier, and trying to keep the center of gravity low, I’m personally not a fan of handlebar loads. Three days of food were in the seat bag&#8230; a person has got to eat!</p>

<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> I will be riding the 2021 TNGA on a 2014 Specialized Stumpy Carbon Hardtail rebuilt, maintained, and fitted by Senoia Bicycles (Thanks Carter and crew!).

XTR brakes and various Specialized carbon bits and carbon wheels with 29&#215;2.25 FastTracks to compensate for my overpacking.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> Wanderlust frame bag, Oveja Negra seatpost bag, and Revelate bags for the cockpit and fork. My shelter, bag, and pad are in a Revelate bag (different bag in picture) secured to a Salsa Anything Cradle. Extra clothing and personal items are in the seat bag. Frame bag, fork bags, and cockpit bags handle food and liquid.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> A Big Agnes Fly Creek UL1 is my shelter. I will be sleeping on a Big Agnes AXL pad and an older LaFuma summer weight bag that is perfect for summer trips. Navigation is on a Garmin 1030+ with the external battery and a Garmin inReach for back-up navi. I mounted the inReach to the Salsa cradle, which gave me the idea to fabricate a light mount for my Serfas bar light to mount to the right side of the cradle, which places it above the gear and in a good spot. Water filtration is with MSR filters. Power is supplied by an Anker 27,000 mAh battery which will power everything for the trip, no need to look for power when I stop.</p>

<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> For the TNGA, I&#8217;ll be riding a 2021 Salsa Fargo. The bike was built with a 1&#215;11 drivetrain using SRAM Force and Rival components. I&#8217;m running a 30T chainring with a 10-42T cassette. I&#8217;m hoping that chainring coupled with a 42T granny gear will help get me up those trails. The wheels are I9 Trail S shod in Maxxis Dissector tires front and rear. I was thinking of running different tires but, as we all know, supply has been limited and these tires have been treating me well recently.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> Salsa frame bag, Ortlieb bar bag, various dry bags strapped to the rear Salsa rack and fork cage. I&#8217;ll be strapping water to my back in an Osprey bag.<br />

<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> I&#8217;ll be riding my Carver (party in the back) 96er that I won in a raffle at the 2011 Snake. This do-it-all bike has ridden the Snake numerous times in many different configurations, from rigid single speed to geared and floaty. I rode it geared with a rigid fork for my first TNGA in 2019. It worked well, but this year calls for new things such as flats and front suspension.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> Mostly Revelate bags with a Sweetroll and Egress up front and a Terrapin in the rear.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> Mostly excited about my Ergon SMC saddle. It may be the best saddle I&#8217;ve ever had. Hopefully, I feel the same way at the end of this ride. Other highlights are my lights. I&#8217;m running a Petzl Iko Core up top with an Ultraspire 800 Multisport out front. Flats are another new thing that I&#8217;m trying out for this year&#8217;s ride, with sandals being a game-time decision. </p>

Handlebars fitted with anti-vibration ESI Chunky Grips to absorb some wrist shock and Profile Designs Boxer Bar Ends for those long climbs.

The build is beautifully tied together by a Shimano XT 11-speed drivetrain for the perfect blend of weight and reliability. I’ll be running an 11-46t cassette with a 32t OneUp oval chainring. Also, I’m running Profile Design aero bars and a PNW dropper post.<br />

<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> I have Salsa frame and top tube bags, with a Swift Industries custom Zeitgeist saddle bag in back, and a Relevate sweet roll up front. Two generic feedbags attached to the Jones bar for water bottles and snacks.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> Big Agnes Copper Spur tent.</p>

<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jon-Brown-2021-TNGA.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jon-Brown-2021-TNGA-2000x1333.jpg" alt="Jon Brown 2021 TNGA" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-104017" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jon-Brown-2021-TNGA-2000x1333.jpg 2000w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jon-Brown-2021-TNGA-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jon-Brown-2021-TNGA-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jon-Brown-2021-TNGA-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jon-Brown-2021-TNGA-1536x1024.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> I will be riding a Specialized Epic Comp Carbon HT on Maxxis Ikon 2.35 up front &#038; 2.2 in rear. I made a few upgrades to ease the contact points including a Stella Anatomica seat on a 155mm dropper/ aluminum Jones H Bars with 2.5” rise &#038; foam grips wrapped with Woolf Tooth supple bar tape to ease the damage to the hands. The rest is stock other than the Absolute Black 32 oval chainring on a 1&#215;12.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> Two Revelate Feed bags for snacks, Gas Tank for tools, and half frame bag. I also have a JPacks FarvaPack top tube bag for easy access to gear while riding and an old Trek seat bag.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> I am using Fenix headlight and bike light with extra batteries to light the way and a Garmin Etrex 32 to navigate. I’ll be napping in an SOL Escape Bivy with a pair of dry clothes. I will be filling my bottles with the Sawyer squeeze filter. I am loving the Wolf Tooth B-RAD double bottle adapter to allow for two 33oz bottles on the downtube. </p>
<h2 class="font-sans-bold">Michael Smith</h2>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 33 / Richmond, Virginia (USA)</h4>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Michael-Smith-2021-TNGA.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Michael-Smith-2021-TNGA-2000x1333.jpg" alt="Michael Smith 2021 TNGA" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-104018" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Michael-Smith-2021-TNGA-2000x1333.jpg 2000w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Michael-Smith-2021-TNGA-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Michael-Smith-2021-TNGA-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Michael-Smith-2021-TNGA-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Michael-Smith-2021-TNGA-1536x1024.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> I’ll be slow cooking, low and steady, on a 2019 Trek Full Stache 8. The bike is fairly stock with Bontrager XR4 Team Issue 29&#215;3” tires, RockShox Pike RL fork, Fox Performance Float EVOL, RE:aktiv rear shock, SUNringlé Duroc 40 SL hoops, and mixed Eagle GX and XO1 1&#215;12 drivetrain. The bike also has upgraded Thomson Trail C Bars with Ergon GS1 grips.</p>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> The bag setup includes a custom Bedrock Bags frame bag, a Chumba Rattlesnake stem-bar feedbag, a Blackburn Outpost seat pack, and last but not least a generic Amazon top tube bag. I also intend to wear a Mission Workshop Hauser backpack.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> I decided for this go around on the TNGA, a little comfort is in order. Limited shut eye will be done on a Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite sleeping pad mated with a SOL Escape bivy. </p>
<h2 class="font-sans-bold">Chad Brandenburg</h2>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 36 / Covington, Georgia (USA)</h4>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chad-Brandenburg-2021-TNGA.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chad-Brandenburg-2021-TNGA.jpg" alt="Chad Brandenburg TNGA" width="1500" height="1000" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-104035" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chad-Brandenburg-2021-TNGA.jpg 1500w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chad-Brandenburg-2021-TNGA-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chad-Brandenburg-2021-TNGA-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Chad-Brandenburg-2021-TNGA-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> The rig I am riding for the TNGA is a Specialized Epic hardtail. It has a modified 1&#215;12 drivetrain with 36T oval front chainring, SRAM AXS derailleur, Roval wheels, all rolling on 29.5&#8243; Maxxis Rekon tires.</p>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> From front to back, I’m running the Revelate Designs front stabilizer harness, Revelate Designs gas tank bag, and the best Mr. Fusion by Porcelain Rocket.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> For a sleep system, I’m using the Big Agnes ULV1 bikepacking tent with the Pluton sleeping bag and Sea to Summit pillow. For navigation, I&#8217;ll use a Garmin Edge series.</p>
<h2 class="font-sans-bold">Brian Toone</h2>
<h4 style="margin-top:0px;">Age 45 / Hoover, Alabama (USA)</h4>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Brian-Toone-2021-TNGA.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Brian-Toone-2021-TNGA.jpg" alt="Brian Toone 2021 TNGA" width="2000" height="1333" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-104106" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Brian-Toone-2021-TNGA.jpg 2000w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Brian-Toone-2021-TNGA-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Brian-Toone-2021-TNGA-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Brian-Toone-2021-TNGA-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Brian-Toone-2021-TNGA-1536x1024.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> I’ll be racing the TNGA on a 2020 Salsa Cutthroat. The bike will feature 2.3” tires and a 1&#215;11 drivetrain with a 36T chainring paired with an 11-46 cassette, Industry Nine Trail S wheels with a SON Dynamo hub up front. With great effort, I have attached water bottle cages to the Rock Shox fork using hose clamps so that they stay in place even on the roughest of terrain.</p>
<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> My largest bag is a Salsa Frame bag that hand screws into the frame. This year, I am opting to go without a seat pack to make it easier to get on/off the bike and negotiate my way through treefall on some of the more rural sections of the course. I am also running a Salsa top tube bag. I will be filtering water through a 2L camelback inline filter that I will start out empty to save weight for the opening climbing (since there is abundant water throughout the early part of the course).<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> I will be trying to complete the race without sleep, so my only shelter will be a down vest for an emergency. I’ll be carrying a Garmin 1030 for navigation. I will be riding to/from the start (400 extra miles), so I have a lot of reflective tape on my bike frame.</p>

<p><strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BIKE:</strong> I will be racing on a 2019 9.8 Trek Pro-Caliber 29” with special order orange paint. I use a Brooks B17 saddle that allows me to wear traditional shorts rather than a chamois.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">BAGS:</strong> An assortment of Revelate Designs bags.<br />
<strong class="font-sans-bold" style="font-size:.9em;">GEAR HIGHLIGHTS:</strong> I do not plan to sleep, so no sleeping bags or other big equipment.</p>
