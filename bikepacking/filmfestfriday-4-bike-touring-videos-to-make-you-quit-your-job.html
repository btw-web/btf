<h1>FilmFestFriday: 4 vids to make you want to quit your job &amp; go by bike</h1>
<p>Before setting out on our recent tour through Central America I had people ask, &#8216;Why do you want to do that?&#8217; Or, &#8216;Are you crazy?&#8217; Many folks don&#8217;t understand why someone would choose to travel on a bicycle. So in this fist installment of FilmFestFriday, I put together 4 videos that I feel capture the magic of Bicycle touring. Maybe they&#8217;ll make you want to quit your job and pack up a bike. Or maybe they&#8217;ll just give you a good feeling as you waste time on a Friday. Enjoy.</p>

<h3>by Pete and Mary</h3>
<p>I love this video. It simply and eloquently captures the struggles, joy and cultural marvels that you can experience traveling by bicycle. It&#8217;s several months on a the rugged road whittled down to several minutes of magic. However, there is a sadness that goes along with it. While we were on tour, we heard that Pete and Mary were struck and killed by a truck in Thailand. Although I never knew them, I feel we share the same spirit and a common bond. R.I.P.</p>

<h2 class="bld">The Road From Karakol</h2>
<h3>by Kyle Dempster, Fitz Cahall and Austin Siadak</h3>
<p>In the summer of 2011 Kyle took off across Kyrgystan to pedal and climb. This guy is funny and his zest for life is immediately contagious. This is a bike film. And a climbing film. And a winner at the 5 Point Film Festival. It&#8217;s also a long one, so waste away!</p>

<h2 class="bld">Cycling Great Britain</h2>
<h3>By Aaron Ortiz</h3>
<p>This is an extremely well done video and does a very good job at capturing the trip as a whole. Excellent quality, and fun. It may put a little smile on your face.</p>

<h2 class="bld">Cycle Touring the Tibetan Plateau</h2>
<h3>By Dave A</h3>
<p>This is an oldie-but-goody. It was created five years ago as &#8216;an attempt at providing a glimpse into the challenging, exciting, and incredibly rewarding world of cycle touring.&#8217;. To me this video does a good job at capturing part of the ride. I love the last few frames.</p>

<h3>About FilmFestFriday</h3>
<p>In the slim chance that someone reading this may have known me on Twitter in my former life, may have see my Friday Playlist. I enjoyed curating a playlist of music every Friday that captured a mood, music genre or concept. I decided to move that energy to Pedaling Nowhere and create a once a month video playlist. There are a lot of great bike videos out there, so check back every third Friday.</p>
