<h1>LA-made Road Runner Bags release bikepacking line</h1>
<p>Road Runner Bags are a small storefront maker in Los Angeles, California, where they sew a variety of messenger bags, rack-top bags, and accessories. Their new bikepacking line &#8211; the Jumbo Jammer, the Pilot/Co-Pilot and the Buoy Bag &#8211; inject the company&#8217;s distinctive styling, and a dazzling palette of colours and patterns, into the often ninja black and camo world of bikepacking. </p>
<p>First up is the Jumbo Jammer, big brother to the company&#8217;s popular Jammer, a bag designed to be mounted either on the handlebars for dirt/singletrack use or below the seat, for road use. Easy access, a massive, expandable internal space, solid mounting points, and a rugged, waterproof build take precedence over weight.  </p>

This bag was made for either front (for dirt) or rear (for road) use and will accommodate a variety of bikes, handle bars and different riding styles.
