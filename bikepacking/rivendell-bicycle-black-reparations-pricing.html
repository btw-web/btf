<h1>Rivendell Bicycle Works Offers Black Reparations Pricing (BRP)</h1>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.rivbike.com/blogs/peeking-through-the-knothole/late-september-and-i-really-should-be-back-in-school-but-covid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blog post/press release</a>, Rivendell&#8217;s CEO, Grant Petersen announced that the 26-year-old San Francisco Bay Area bicycle company will be offering Black Reparations Pricing (BRP) for Black customers starting on October 12th. Petersen states:</p>
<div class="spotlight">
<em>&#8220;The American bicycle industry has been racist, often overtly racist, since 1878, and Rivendell has been obliviously—not &#8220;obviously&#8221;—racist ever since 1994. We say this not to scold the industry, not to scold other bicycle businesses, and not to be on trend.</p>
<p>For the last two years, Rivendell Bicycle Works has offered a 45 percent discount to Black customers who shopped in person. COVID has curtailed that. They are going national with the same plan, but now with a name and an acronym: Black Reparations Pricing (BRP).</p>
<p>Ten percent of Rivendell’s bikes and frames will be allocated for BRP. In the 12-month period beginning October, 2020, they’ll make about 850 bikes, 85 of which will be set aside for the discount program. </p>
<p>In its BRP plan, Rivendell adds, &#8220;Racism doesn&#8217;t respond to inaction or self-proclamation. In other words, it doesn&#8217;t go away when you know, even in your bones, that all people are created equal. It responds to anti-racist action. Reparations are an example. Not because Reparations are &#8220;a nice thing to do,&#8221; but because they&#8217;re owed. </p>
<p>Reparations acknowledges that, in this country, white wealth—recent or inherited/generational, has been ‘earned’ by the labor of Black people, who, even after slavery, were never given a leg up. Your non-Black tycoon great-grampa may have been born poor, may have been a sharp and clever go-getter at the top of his class, but he wasn&#8217;t born Black.”</em>

<p>According to Rivendell, Black Reparations Pricing is the same 45% off of typical walk-in sales prices (retail x 0.55). Ten percent of their bikes and frames will be allocated for BRP. In addition, Rivendell is also offering their customers the opportunity to contribute to the BRP fund with every purchase they make!
