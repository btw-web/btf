Fortunately, there’s a growing network of bikepacker-friendly hosts who understand ubs. From free city park camping to luxury cyclist-tailored retreats (and everything in between), we’ve compiled the ultimate state-by-state guide to the most bikepacker-friendly accommodations in the country.</p>

<h3>Slater, Colorado</h3>
<p><strong>Route(s): <a href="/routes/great-divide-mountain-bike-route-gdmbr/">Great Divide Mountain Bike Route</a></strong><br />
<span class="font-sans-bold" style="color:#A23D3B;">Cost: Donation-based camping and food, $30 per night for lodge rooms, $90 per night for cabins (if you arrive via pedal power)</span></p>
<p>Kirsten Henricksen never imagined her family’s hunting lodge would serve touring cyclists in the off-season. In fact, back in 2006, when Tour Divide event organizer Matthew Lee rolled into the driveway at Brush Mountain Lodge, Kirsten didn’t know anything about bikes or bikepacking, let alone the Tour Divide.</p>
<p>“I just remember this dude rolled in with nothing on his bike, he was skinny as a rail, I could see his ribs popping out,” says Henricksen. “I was sure he was just some yahoo who was lost.”</p>
<p>Of course, Lee wasn’t lost, but he <em>was</em> hungry. Henricksen, who had been hosting a construction crew all summer, offered him some leftovers, to which he replied: <em>can the other racers stop for food, too?</em></p>
<p>“That was such a key moment, looking back,” says Henricksen. “If I had been grumpy that day and said no then things wouldn’t have turned out the way they did.”</p>
<p>Today, Brush Mountain Lodge is as much a part of the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route as Fleecer Ridge in Montana and Pie Town in New Mexico. In 2019 alone, Henricksen served some 800 riders, from Tour Divide racers to Great Divide tourers. Open to riders from Memorial Day to Labor Day, the lodge’s cabins, rooms, and floor/yard space are provided on a first come, first served basis. Though its location—14 miles up a parched gravel climb, in the middle of a sparsely serviced 140-mile stretch—is magical in and of itself, it is Henricksen’s unfailing ability to make strangers feel like family that truly gives Brush Mountain Lodge its ethereal quality. </p>
<p>Henricksen will wash your salt-crusted chamois, provide clean clothes for you to lounge in, and serve you pizza and beer and soda and pancakes till you pop (please donate according to your intake). She’ll give you a hug or tough love, whichever you need most, and some lube for your chain (the lodge also has a well-stocked Butt and Body Repair Center for all of your chafed-nether-region-needs). These days, Henricksen has a bike of her own, a custom build from Cjell Monē. While she’s enjoyed experiencing some of the roads around the lodge, the idea of riding a thousand miles to get there still seems crazy. Fortunately for bikepackers, Henricksen likes a little crazy.</p>
<p>“The whole idea was pretty insane to me and I loved it immediately,” she says of the Tour Divide. “The self sufficiency, the whole ‘no reward.’ That it’s a race based on a gentleman’s agreement totally appeals to me. At first, I wasn’t totally connected to the cycling part but the spirit of it spoke to me right away.”</p>
<p>In the winter, Henricksen heads south to Phoenix, Arizona. She is currently finalizing the last touches on a Brush Mountain-esque bikepacker friendly pad at her home, which is conveniently located near the <a href="/routes/fools-loop-arizona/">Fool’s Loop</a> and <a href="/routes/black-canyon-trail/">Black Canyon Trail</a>.</p>

<span class="font-sans-bold" style="color:#A23D3B;">Cost:  Bunk beds from $32 per night, rooms from $50 per night</span></p>
<p>Even today, Leadville feels like the last vestige of the Wild West. The storied legacies of mining and mountaineering keep this mountain town undeniably quirky. Inn the Clouds is the perfect complement to that vibe, offering road-weary travelers of all kinds, from cyclists to thru-hikers, a place to rest, recreate, and reconnect with civilization (if only for a night).</p>

<h3>Ellijay, Georgia</h3>
<p><strong>Route(s): <a href="/routes/trans-north-georgia-tnga/">Trans North Georgia</a>, <a href="/routes/cohutta-cat/">Cohutta Cat</a></strong><br />
<span class="font-sans-bold" style="color:#A23D3B;">Cost: Cabins from $65 per night, camping from $19 per night (10% off meals and lodging for pedal-powered visitors on ITTs)</span></p>
<p>Hidden away in the rhododendron-lined hollars of the Chattahoochee National Forest, Mulberry Gap might be just 12 miles from downtown Ellijay, Georgia, but it feels worlds away. Only accessible via gravel Forest Service roads, Mulberry Gap is surrounded on all sides by national forest and over 100 miles of singletrack, including the Pinhoti Trail.</p>
<p>“There’s no service, the WiFi is terrible,” says Mulberry Gap co-owner Kate Gates. “But it’s great because anybody can really just disconnect.”</p>
<p>Originally opened in 2007 as Mulberry Gap Bunkhouse Inn and Camping, it didn’t take long for Kate and her husband Andrew—also cyclists—to realize that their core visitorship was made up of mountain bikers. The Gateses changed the name to Mulberry Gap Mountain Bike Getaway to reflect their clientele and installed a bike wash station, bought a shuttle van and trailer, and stocked their shelves with repair essentials and craft beer. Following the 2008 designation of Ellijay as the Mountain Bike Capital of Georgia, business at Mulberry Gap started booming. </p>
<p>“It’s been word of mouth mostly, where people were hearing about this mountain bike-specific place in the middle of the woods where you could get showers and home-cooked meals and sleep,” says Kate. “It took a lot of people a long time to understand it but a lot of them just didn’t even know we’re here.”</p>
<p>Nowadays, Mulberry Gap is at the heart of North Georgia’s mountain bike culture. Having bikepacked the Florida Trail and toured throughout Costa Rica, Kate and Andrew are also bringing their own love of bikepacking to Mulberry Gap. In 2019, Mulberry Gap hosted the third annual Bikepacking Summit. The retreat also serves as a welcome oasis for Trans North Georgia and Cohutta Cat racers in need of food, clean clothes, and a place to sleep. For cyclists not participating in the grand departs for these two routes, the Gateses offer pedal-powered touring visitors 10% off meals and lodging (the discount is capped at $50). Out-of-towners flying in for their Georgia bikepacking adventure can have their bikes shipped to Mulberry Gap, whose staff will also build or break down bikes for shipping for $50. Be forewarned: after you’ve experienced the family-style dining, mini-bike-Jenga, late-night fireside chats, and hot tubs here, you may never leave. </p>

<h3>Whitefish, Montana</h3>
<p><strong>Route(s): <a href="/routes/great-divide-mountain-bike-route-gdmbr/">Great Divide Mountain Bike Route</a></strong><br />
<span class="font-sans-bold" style="color:#A23D3B;">Cost: Group campsites $50 per night, single bunk beds from $50 per night, private rooms from $110 per night</span></p>
<p>We can all thank backpacking for helping Cricket Butler find her way to the world of two-wheeled travel. It was two backpacking trips, specifically thru-hikes on the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail, that instilled in Butler a deep love for long-distance, human-powered travel. But it was also backpacking that blew out her knees. It was the early 2000s, and Butler, then on the cusp of her 40th birthday, was not ready to slow down. She bought a bike and started competing in long-distance, single-day endurance rides, which eventually led her to bikepacking and, serendipitously, discovering the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route and the Tour Divide.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be here, the retreat wouldn’t be here, if it was not for bikepacking,” says Butler. “It kinda changed my life.”</p>
<p>In 2008, Butler and a friend toured the Great Divide for her 40th birthday. When she arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border 2,700 miles later, she knew she was hooked. The next three years, she returned to compete in the Tour Divide. During each of her southbound journeys, Butler came to know Whitefish through the lens of a bikepacker. She already loved the vibrant Montana mountain town—she and her ex-husband used to own a place where they’d stay during ski trips. But as a bikepacker, Butler felt the accommodations were too pricey for riders on the go. She only stayed in Whitefish once while racing, and only because a group of racers split the cost for an otherwise expensive hotel room. </p>
<p>Then, in 2012, Butler moved to Whitefish with her two sons in tow. She and her husband had recently divorced, and Butler was ready for a change.</p>
<p>“I needed a job, and the one thing I really knew and was passionate about was bikepacking and taking care of cyclists,” she says. “I found this property right on the Whitefish Trail, which was developing at the time, and all of the parts fell into place.”</p>
<p>The Whitefish Bike Retreat today is a one-stop-shop for bikepackers. Beginner bikepackers can hire Butler for consultation on all things Tour Divide, rent bikes and Oveja Negra bikepacking bags, and even have Butler put together a Whitefish-based bikepacking route to meet your goals and skill level. The retreat offers guests everything from bike wash stations to shuttles—Butler will even take Tour Divide hopefuls up to the starting line in Banff. </p>
<p>“I consider Tour Divide racers my people,” she says. “I remember being in that place. If you’re sick, injured, overwhelmed, we’re here to help you.”</p>

<h2 style="padding-bottom:0px;">Ovando, Montana <a href="https://ovandomontana.net/cycle-friendly" class="ss-icon ss-standard" style="font-size:18px;color:#A23D3B;box-shadow:none;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a></h2>
<p><strong>Route(s): <a href="/routes/great-divide-mountain-bike-route-gdmbr/">Great Divide Mountain Bike Route</a> </strong><br />
<span class="font-sans-bold" style="color:#A23D3B;">Cost:  Free camping in designated areas, $5 donation for teepee/jail/shepherd’s wagon, private rooms at <a href="https://www.ovandoinn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ovando Inn</a> (call for latest fees)</p>
<p>The close-knit community of Ovando, population 71, has always existed on the fringe of civilization. In 1998, when Kathy Schoendoerfer moved to Ovando to work at a guest ranch, she remembers feeling like she had moved to a new frontier, despite being just over an hour’s drive north of Montana’s capital in Helena.</p>
<p>“Nobody knew about Ovando, even people in Missoula,” she says, which is an hour west and the closest major city. “Ovando in 2000 was dead or dying, and we needed people to know we were alive.”</p>
<p>The community asked Schoendoerfer to open a fly fishing shop to accommodate the growing number of anglers visiting Ovando’s Blackfoot River. A few years after opening the Blackfoot Angler, Schoendoerfer and the rest of the Ovando community started noticing visitors of a different breed altogether: bikepackers. There weren’t many of them, maybe 20 total over the course of a few months, but they bought food and seemed friendly, and Ovando was curious.</p>
<p>One night, Schoendoerfer received a call from a business owner in Seeley Lake, about a day’s ride north of Ovando on the Great Divide. The person asked if Ovando could help a Tour Divide racer, an older woman from Ohio who was the last rider in the pack and struggling to stay motivated. Ovando rallied. They cleaned out a sheep wagon for her to sleep in, pooled together food and beer, and made a sign cheering her on and letting her know she wasn’t alone. When the woman rode in later that night, she burst into tears and lingered well into the morning to personally thank everyone in Ovando.</p>
<p>“It felt so good for us who did it,” says Schoendoerfer. “We thought, if we felt that good about helping one person, well, there are a whole lot more cyclists coming through. What we do for one we do for all.”</p>
<p>Ovando’s bikepacker friendliness is now ingrained in nearly every aspect of the community. The Brand Bar Museum provides cyclists free camping and power strips for electronic charging. The Ovando Inn and Blackfoot Commercial Company stays open late during the Tour Divide season so racers can get food no matter what time they roll into town. They als offer $10 showers (soap and towel included) and a laundromat for cyclists not staying at the inn. For $5 per night, Ovando allows cyclists to stay in any one of its cool lodging options: a teepee with two cots, an enclosed shepherd’s wagon, and even the original town jail (circa 1800s). Cyclists can also camp for free on the gravel near the teepee or at the Valiton Park at the end of Main Street, and there are outhouses specifically for cyclists. </p>
<p>Of course, Schoendoerfer is at the core of this next-level hospitality. She takes photos of nearly every single rider that passes through Ovando and posts them online for their friends and family to follow along. She’s even installed a webcam outside the Blackfoot Angler to catch cyclists arriving late at night after she’s left the shop. Though Schoendoerfer herself is not a cyclist, she has been known to skydive and whitewater raft and shares an appreciation for the rugged Montana wilderness that surrounds Ovando. To her, there’s nothing more rewarding than helping stoke the spirit of adventure. </p>
<p>“From a town that wasn’t even known in Missoula in the 1990s, we’re now known from Banff to Belgium and all through the cycling world,” she says. “When I watch these people come through, I live vicariously through them.”</p>

<p>How do you make your passion your work? That is the million-dollar question The Bike Farm owners Eva Surls and Cashion Smith sought to answer when they moved to western North Carolina in 2011. Both Surls and Smith were avid cyclists, but their backgrounds—Surls’ in integrative health and Smith’s in medical devices—didn’t always lend themselves to ample time in the woods. For their own health and happiness, Surls and Smith knew that needed to change.</p>
<p>“We believe that the bike is the answer to a lot of what ails us these days,” says Smith, “from distractions on social media to obesity to traffic and pollution and the general disconnect that exists with human beings and their natural environment. The Bike Farm is a realization of mine and Eva’s dream to be able to pursue our passion, share our love of mountain biking, and connect individuals to themselves and the natural world via the bicycle.”</p>
<p>Initially, The Bike Farm opened in 2012 solely as a guide and coaching service and in tandem with the Oskar Blues REEB Ranch. A couple of years later, Surls and Smith found their own property, a 440-acre property that butted up against the boundary to Pisgah National Forest. The Bike Farm today seamlessly binds Surls’ and Smith’s vision for a bike-centered community gathering grounds—there’s a few miles of trail on the property, a dedicated skills coaching area, and everything from forest camping to luxurious deck glamping. True to their core beliefs, The Bike Farm offers discounted rates for visitors who work in the adaptive sports and wilderness therapy fields.</p>

<p>Located on 64 acres beside Pisgah National Forest, Pilot Cove was built by outdoor lovers for outdoor lovers. Pilot Cove’s spacious cabins, luxurious beds, and full kitchens will feel like serious splurging if you’ve been spending your bikepacking tour eating Knorr rice sides and hunkering down in a perpetually damp sleeping bag. </p>
<p>Pilot Cove co-owner Collin O’Berry gets it. O’Berry is an Appalachian Trail thru-hiker and former trail builder. He and the Pilot Cove team have catered this national forest paradise specifically to those of us who like to work hard to play hard. </p>
<p>“We try to foster an environment where outdoor recreation is at the forefront of Pilot Cove,” says O’Berry. “You can essentially get lost in Pisgah within a very short road ride of your front door.”</p>
<p>Each cabin comes equipped with washing and drying machines, outdoor spigots with hot and cold water for year-round bike washing, on-site trails, and even a live music amphitheater for when you need just a splash of culture in your otherwise disconnected bikecation.</p>

<h3>Davis, West Virginia</h3>
<p><strong>Route(s): <a href="https://www.facebook.com/spruceknobcycling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GRUSK</a> (Gravel Race Up Spruce Knob)</strong><br />
<span class="font-sans-bold" style="color:#A23D3B;">Cost: Yard camping donation-based, private apartments from $99 per night</span></p>
<p>Are you even a cyclist if you’ve never been to Davis, West Virginia? The original birthplace of Laird Knight’s 24 Hour mountain bike race series, Davis in the 1990s and early 2000s was the hub for East Coast mountain biking. Long before bike parks and purpose-built trail systems, there was Davis and there was Canaan Valley and all of the mud bogs, roots, and rocks you could handle. </p>
<p>In 1982, Knight started Blackwater Bikes in an apartment above what is now Davis’ brewery, Stumptown Ales. Over the years, the bike shop has moved locations and changed ownership, but it’s always stayed true to its mountain bike core. Today, the bike shop, owned by Rob Stull, is perched above the banks of the Blackwater River surrounded by the Monongahela National Forest. Blackwater Bikes transcends a typical bike shop—part community hub, part bike shop, the atmosphere at Blackwater Bikes is welcoming and unhurried. There’s a seating area and a deck where customers can hang, a bike wash station, and two apartments below the bike shop where bikepackers will enjoy some hard-earned creature comforts for the night.</p>
<p>“We gotta change things up with the times and try to diversify and keep this business sustainable,” says Stull. “It helps being in the middle of a million-acre national forest. There are tons of forest service roads that people can take advantage of, not to mention trails. Davis is perfectly set up for bikepackers.”</p>
<p>In addition to helping bikepackers with bike shipping and building/breakdown, route logistics, shuttles, and repairs, Blackwater Bikes also offers donation-based camping to those racing or touring GRUSK, a gravel route up to West Virginia’s highest point at Spruce Knob. Even after hours, cyclists can access the shop’s picnic table and potable water. </p>
