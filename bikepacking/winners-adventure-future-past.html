<h1>Announcing the Winners of the Adventures Future-Past Competition</h1>
<p>Sorry for the delay on this folks, but sorting through 146 entries, studying maps, asking questions, and wrangling the votes of five judges was no simple task. Many thanks to everyone who took the time to submit! There were a lot of great entries <a href="/plog/adventures-future-past-competition/">in this competition</a>, which made the decisions particularly difficult. Ultimately, we selected 25 winners—who have all been contacted—and we&#8217;ll be publishing their overnighters and weekend routes over the next couple of months leading up to the Swift Campout at the end of September. Here are the top six winners.</p>
<h2>GRAND PRIZE PACKAGE (5 WINNERS TOTAL)</h2>
<p>We’re super stoked to be giving away five prize packages of some of our favorite gear. These winners will receive a new Swift Zeitgeist bag, a Wolf Tooth EnCase Bar One Kit, one pair of Bedrock Cairn 3D Sandals, an Oveja Negra Royale Hip Pack, Rattlesnake Bar Tape and patches from CampAndGoSlow, a Topo Designs Global Hat, a MIIR Camp Cup, and several other goodies. Find the winners below, in no particular order.</p>

<h3>Joshua Meissner: Lost in Brandenburg</h3>
<p>The Lost-in-Brandenburg Loop is an easily accessible mixed surface overnight bikepacking route that covers the rural and forested north-east of Brandenburg. Exiting the Berlin metro area, the loop travels over the area&#8217;s infamous sandy and cobbled doubletracks, weaving in bouts of gravel, mellow singletrack, and smooth tarmac. Get lost and find yourself in the endless pine forests and tiny towns seemingly stuck in time. View the <a href="/routes/lost-in-brandenburg-loop/">full route guide here</a>.</p>

<h3>Sara Bukies: The Swiss Jura Explorer</h3>
<p>The Swiss Jura Explorer is a challenging bikepacking loop through what could be called <em>the last frontier of Switzerland</em>, a pristine natural area that&#8217;s sparsely populated. The route includes beautiful views over wooded Jura hills on one side, and fantastic views over the whole Swiss midlands to the highest peaks of the Alps on the other. Publish date: first week in August.</p>

<h3>Marcin Stoch: Lemkivska Kobiouka</h3>
<p>Lemkivska Kobiouka is a 150-mile long bikepacking route in the Carpathian mountains that traverses one of the most remote and wild areas of Poland. Though once full of bustling villages, the valleys of the Low Beskid mountains are now quiet and desolate, a land shaped by a tragic history. Publish date: first week in August.</p>

<h3>Caz Whitehead: Kuitpo Forest Overnighter</h3>
<p>A meandering out-and-back route (including a fancy hut-camp overnight stop) most recommended for the cooler months. Foggy, winding gravel roads and hiking paths mean sights like black cockatoos, pine plantations, and abandoned mine shafts, all within a short distance from Adelaide City. Publish date: next week.</p>
