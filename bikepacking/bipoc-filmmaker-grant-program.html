<h1>Last Call: Filmed by Bike BIPOC Filmmaker Grant</h1>
<p>Earlier this fall, we shared details of the new BIPOC Filmmaker Grant from Filmed by Bike and Machines for Freedom, which will award cash grants to emerging BIPOC filmmakers to provide the spotlight they deserve. Each year, the grant will support at least two filmmakers who are Black, Indigenous, or People of Color by providing up to $2,000 and one-on-one advising, then share those stories by presenting them in the annual Filmed by Bike Festival, which tours the world. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re proud to have come on board as a sponsor for 2021, and we&#8217;re asking for your help in making sure this opportunity reaches as many potential applicants as possible. The deadline to apply for this year&#8217;s program is December 1st, 2020, which is just one week from today. </p>

<b>From Filmed by Bike:</b><br />
We have long had a focus of carving out intentional space for positions of power, prominence and celebration for Black, Indigenous, and all People of Color (BIPOC), and for women. We spend eight months of the year digging into the far reaching corners of the internet in search of the world’s best bike movies. (Really, it’s not as scary of a place as you might think it is.)</p>
<p>You know what we’ve learned over the years? The world is dreadfully devoid of films created by or about BIPOC. That’s not to say the films aren’t out there, it’s just to say they are rare and precious gems – the quantity of which does not reflect the population of people who are passionate about riding bikes.

<h3>How To Apply</h3>
<p>The BIPOC Grant Program will offer grants of $1,500 to $2,000 USD to emerging filmmakers who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, with no prior experience required. There is no fee to apply and the final number of grants available will be determined by financial contributions to the BIPOC Grant Program. Projects must have a strong central theme of bicycles. </p>
<p>Applications are due by December 1st, 2020, with films to be completed by December 31, 2021. Any films completed by April 1, 2021, will be shown in the 2021 festival. Filmmakers also have the option of being paired with an advisor for one-on-one support in bringing the film concept to the screen, and all will be presented at the Annual Filmed by Bike Festival in Portland, Oregon, before going on tour around the world! <a href="https://filmedbybike.org/bipoc-filmmaker-grant-program/application-and-guidelines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apply here</a>.</p>
<p>As this is a crowdfunded program, Filmed By Bike is asking you to help reduce barriers and bring more representation to the world of bike movies. If you can, <a href="https://filmedbybike.org/product/donate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">make a donation here</a> to support the program. </p>
