<h1>Dynaplug Review: Micro Pro Tubeless Tire Repair Kit</h1>
<p>With a proper tubeless setup, and generally tough tires, it&#8217;s not often that you have to resort to tire plugs. However, in my opinion, they are an indispensable part of a proper <a href="/gear/bikepacking-repair-kit/">bikepacking repair kit</a>. Relying on spare tubes alone introduces the risk of pinch flats, small punctures, additional patches&#8230; and the prospect of having to carry your bike out of the backcountry should your options run out — which I have experienced. I typically carry five or six of the reddish brown strips and the tiny screwdriver handle tool to insert them. In the event of a small tear, they work. But they require some finesse, super glue, and often equally as much frustration and swearing. Someone pointed out the Dynaplug as a superior solution, so I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>In essence, Dynaplug is designed to be a quick and easy puncture repair tool for tubeless tires. The crux of the patented system is a two-piece aluminum body with a hollow stainless steel insertion tube that&#8217;s threaded into the handle. The tube is preloaded with a repair plug where it sits in place, ready for action. The repair plugs are each made of a proprietary rubber-impregnated cord mounted to a pointed, non-abbrasive brass tip. </p>
<p>This silver Dynaplug Micro Pro tool rattled around my frame bag and backpack for months prior to our trip in the Republic of Georgia. Even though I hadn&#8217;t had a chance to test its merit, I decided to bring it along, untried, hoping that it would work in the event of a tear big enough to thwart the efficacy of tubeless sealant. Fortunately I was unlucky enough to be able to try it, three times&#8230;</p>

<p>At first glance, the plugs seem a bit odd; the sharp brass tips don&#8217;t look like something you&#8217;d want sticking inside your bike tire. However, according to Dynaplug, if the brass tip breaks free from the plug, there is nothing to worry about. They chose brass because it&#8217;s a soft metal that will wear down over time, and brass is inherently non-abrasive to tire rubber. Based on centrifugal testing they found that the tip will eventually disintegrate, without causing further issues. This never happened during our testing period, but it seems like it having the brass piece bouncing around inside the tire could be rather annoying if it did occur.</p>
<p>At any rate, function is more important than form. Each brass-tipped plug is designed to offer a permanent fix for punctures up to 4.6mm (about 3/16&#8243;) in diameter. In the event of an emergency, Dynaplug states you can use up to four plugs at once for larger tears, although they also mention that a proper repair should be made once available. It&#8217;s also worth noting that they offer rounded, &#8216;bullet-tipped&#8217; plugs as well.</p>

<h3>Dynaplug Micro Pro or Pill?</h3>
<p>The Dynaplug comes in several different configurations. The two we checked out are the most popular, the lozenge-shaped Dynaplug Micro Pro and Dynaplug Pill. Both are housed within the same 6061 machined aluminum capsule. The two halves thread together and are sealed by an O-ring. Both contain the same attachments, although the Pill is anodized and costs $5 more. The tool itself, albeit small, seems rather excessive based on its contents. The honeycomb of cavities inside the casing store an assortment of odd accessories and pointy brass-tipped plugs. Both the Micro Pro tool and Pill contain two pointed tip tire repair plugs within two insertion tubes, one micro knife, one air stopper. The tool also comes with three additional plugs and one pipe cleaner. First off, I never used the ultrasharp awl-like air stopper or the pipe cleaner. The air stopper is to be used to seal the air leak while preparing the Dynaplug. But each time I&#8217;ve used the tool, there was a tear significant enough to drop most of the pressure pretty quickly, before I could access the tool. However, this might come in handy for large thorns where you might ‘swap’ out the thorn for the stopper. But in my experience, Orange Seal does a pretty good job plugging such holes without a plug. Regarding the other tools, the knife can be used to trim the excess &#8216;tail&#8217; from the plug once inserted — which Dynaplug recommends – and the pipe-cleaner is for cleaning the insertion plug should it get clogged.</p>

<h3>The Dynaplug in Action</h3>
<p>Performing a repair with the Dynaplug is ridiculously simple. Gone are the days of fiddling with the little plastic handled insertion tool, with sealant spewing everywhere during the process. The visco-elastic material that makes up the plug works quickly and the tool is relatively easy to use. The plug is preloaded into the insertion tube that&#8217;s already screwed into the handle of the tool. So you simply unscrew the two halves and push the plug into the puncture. Once the tool is removed, the squared edges of the brass tip catch inside the tire leaving the super sticky rubber-impregnated cord to adhere to the puncture edges and expand to seal the leak. Each time I used it the leak was sealed immediately without a lot of tire spinning and ensuing panic. We used it twice in Georgia for two small rips a little over 1/8&#8243; that required just one plug to seal immediately.</p>
<p>The most recent use was back home in Pisgah, as shown in the photos below. Gin hit a rock and tore a hole in the sidewall of her tire, a little less than 1/4&#8243; wide. Not having the Dynaplug immediately on hand, she tried a &#8216;classic&#8217; strip plug; it didn&#8217;t seal the tear. Later on, after her ride was shortened, we pumped up the tire and applied finger pressure to the tear to hold in some of the air. We then quickly inserted and removed the Dynaplug and it sealed right up. Since the repair, Gin has been on several trail rides on our local rooty and rocky singletrack around Pisgah without any issues. This is the third time we&#8217;ve used it and each was successful, sealing the puncture with plenty of riding afterwards to prove it. All in all, I have found the Dynaplug to work like a charm and plan on making it a staple in my kit from here on out.</p>

<li><strong>It&#8217;s very light</strong> and easy to carry.</li>
<li><strong>The Pill and Dynaplug Micro Pro Tool are compact</strong>&#8230; perfect for bikepacking.</li>
<li><strong>The preloaded tube is quick</strong> and neat compared to fiddly plastic insert and gummy &#8216;classic&#8217; orange plugs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>It&#8217;s kind of expensive</strong>, although it will probably last a long time, and it&#8217;s made in the USA.</li>
<li><strong>It would be nice if it held more plugs</strong> in lighter plastic tubes within the capsule.</li>
<li><strong>The brass tips are slightly concerning</strong>, although I have heard of no complaints or failures. Plus, you can get rounded &#8216;bullet-tipped&#8217; plugs as well.</li>
<li><strong>The pieces rattle around a little inside the shell</strong>, but I stuffed a cotton swab in there and that solved the problem (cotton swabs have always been a staple while bike touring&#8230; vibrations kill).</li>
