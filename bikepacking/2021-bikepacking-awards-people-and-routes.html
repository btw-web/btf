<h1>2021 Bikepacking Awards: People and Routes</h1>
<p>In parts one and two of the 2021 Bikepacking Awards, we featured our top picks for Gear of The Year and Best Bikepacking Videos, Photography, Writing, and Art. Our third and final awards installment celebrates the people who have inspired us through the richness of their storytelling, their commitment to the community, or their use of bikepacking to further important causes. We also pay tribute route makers by honoring their creations—everything from small overnighter escapes to meticulously designed multi-week journeys. We’re thankful that this unique resource continues to grow and flourish, and we couldn’t do so without our talented community.</p>
<p>Note: For the decision on routes, we opened the process with a call for nominations that identified nearly 25 routes. From there, seven of us cast blind votes; the results were from a direct tally of our votes, which were based on several criteria, including the originality/intent, quality of documentation, and which we’d like to ride most. In addition, we reached out to the <strong><a href="/join">Bikepacking Collective</a></strong>, our community of members, to get their input. Without further ado, let’s get on to the awards.</p>
<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Inspiring Bikepackers of The Year</h2>
<p class="master_excerpt" style="font-size:.9em;">Inspiring Bikepackers of the Year highlights five individuals who inspired us in 2021 with their legacy, outstanding accomplishments, leadership, and commitment to the community.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top:6px;">Iohan Gueorguiev</h3>
<p>The most prominent mention decidedly goes to the late, great Iohan Gueorguiev, whose journey in this world sadly came to end on August 19th of this year. Born in Bulgaria in 1988, Iohan has inspired many through his self-made films over a seven-year, ~100,000-kilometer journey. Iohan is best remembered for his positivity, charisma, and ability to connect with others on the road. As we wrote in our 2017 in his Ambassador of the Year Award summary, “We’ve always felt Iohan shows a wonderful ability to connect with those around him. We can’t help but admire his enthusiasm that bubbles through on all his adventures, despite how hard they’ve been at times.” We&#8217;ll miss you, Iohan. Rest in peace. <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/iohan-gueorguiev-1988-2021/">Read our announcement here</a>.</div>

<h3 style="margin-top:6px;">Quinn Brett</h3>
<p>
Quinn Brett, an accomplished triathlete, rock climber, and ultra-runner, was paralyzed from the waist down after surviving a 100-foot fall during an ascent of El Capitan. Quinn was forced to take a different path and became the first adaptive cyclist to complete the Tour Divide back in June. With a custom hand bike alongside her riding partner Joe Foster, the two were able to tackle about 100 miles per day, completing this year’s route from Eureka, Montana, to Antelope Wells, New Mexico, in just under a month. This inspiring trip also helped raise funds for adaptive equipment to help others explore the outdoors. <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/quinn-brett-tour-divide/">Find the film here</a>.</div>

<h3 style="margin-top:6px;">Scotti Lechuga</h3>
<p>
We&#8217;ve been following Scotti&#8217;s efforts for the past few years. This year, there was one stand out achievement that put her on this list. After a record-setting time of 5 days, 10 hours, and 49 minutes, Scotti was the first rider to finish the 2021 Arkansas High Country Race, besting the entire field and setting a new women’s fastest known time on the 1,030-mile course in the process. Congrats, Scotti!</div>

<h3 style="margin-top:6px;">New Forest Off Road Club</h3>
<p>
The women and non-binary-led New Forest Off Road Club was founded in the post-lockdown stages of the pandemic to facilitate group rides. It has since evolved to become much more than that. The NFORC runs on the mission to increase representation in the outdoors, and ultimately to reshape the idea of a &#8220;cycling club.&#8221; Between October 2020 and October 2021, the leadership group of 10 women and non-binary people have facilitated 46 social group rides with 202 individuals. <a href="https://www.thenewforestoffroadclub.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Learn more here</a>.

<h3 style="margin-top:6px;">Sofiane Sehili</h3>
<p>
If you keep up with ultra-endurance bikepacking races, it&#8217;s hard to ignore the accomplishments of 38-year-old bike messenger Sofiane Sehili. Just in the last two years, Sofiane&#8217;s posted 1st and 2nd place in the Atlas Mountain Race, Hope 1000, Transpyranees, and Three Peaks events. And this year, after breaking his leg in December of 2020, he came back to take first place in the <a href="/tracker/2021srmr/">Silk Road Mountain Race</a>. We look forward to seeing what Sofiane can do in 2022!</div>

From the shores of the Arctic Ocean in Norway to the wild Atlantic coastline of southwestern Portugal, the European Divide Trail is the latest epic cross-continental bikepacking route. The recommended 100-day itinerary offers a diverse array of landscapes as it wends its way across the Europe—from northeast to southwest—traversing nine countries and countless dirt roads, singletrack trails, quiet lanes, and traffic-free byways. Kudos to Andy’s dedication and ambition to bringing this route to fruition as a one-person project. We look forward to seeing it refined and improved in the years ahead.

<h4>Veneto Divide</h4>
<p><em>By Andrea Securo.</em> The Veneto Divide is a nearly 400-kilometer bikepacking route traversing the Venetian Prealps in northern Italy. This masterfully documented 7-8 day ride takes in a variety of terrain and landscapes rich in history and incredible views that rival the overpopulated Dolomites. Designed by the same person behind the longstanding Veneto Trail bikepacking event, the Veneto Divide offers a continuous up and down on the physical border between the Alps and the Po Valley, crossing the entirety of the Veneto region from west to east. Well done, Andrea. Find the <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/veneto-divide/">full guide here</a>.

<h4>Tree to Sea Loop</h4>
<p><em>By Miles Arbour.</em> Vancouver Island is a playground for outdoor enthusiasts, boasting year-round access, diverse landscapes, and loads of bikepacking potential. Our own Miles Arbour took advantage of this over the summer and created the Tree to Sea Loop, an incredible 1,000-kilometre gravel loop around the lesser-known areas on the north end of the island. The route combines some of the best gravel riding in Canada with incredible scenery, oceanside villages, towering coastal mountains, and deep fjords, with opportunities for spelunking, whale watching, waterside camping, and much more. <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/tree-to-sea-loop-vancouver-island/">Find the full guide here</a>.

We were super excited to post this one, and are equally as stoked to see it win the top spot for weeklong bikepacking routes. We look forward to seeing folks enjoy it next summer.

<h4>The Monumental Loop (V2)</h4>
<p>
<em>By Matt Mason.</em> First published in January 2017, the Monumental Loop was designed to be a full tour of Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument. Unfortunately, it was a little too difficult for many riders to enjoy. The route also sparked a bikepacking boom in Las Cruces, so in effort to increase accessibility, rider enjoyment, and help boost New Mexico’s efforts to establish a robust outdoor recreation economy, Matt Mason and crew scouted and mapped some major reroutes, making a more approachable route that almost anyone can enjoy.

<h4>Marmot’s Land</h4>
<p>
<em>By Sara Bukies and Andreas Krucker.</em> Marmot&#8217;s Land is a figure-8 loop that takes riders through the beautiful area around the Swiss National Park with spectacular views of the surrounding mountains and rock formations, a lot of challenging climbs, and some of the best flowy singletrack trails in the area. Welcome to the southeast of Switzerland, the land of marmots! While not a terribly long route, Marmot&#8217;s Land is easily stretched out to a five-day ride with a whopping 22,000 feet of climbing and some challenging terrain. Kudos on another great route, Sarah and Andreas. Find the <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/marmots-land/">full route guide here</a>.</div>

<em>By Logan Watts.</em> Long in the works, the Wilson&#8217;s Ramble is a quintessential 3-4 day bikepacking route that loops through several spectacular geographic zones around the Wilson Creek watershed and the Linville Gorge Wilderness. The route uses an orchestrated mix of flowing singletrack, remote and rugged forest roads, and graded gravel to provide a great long weekend riding experience that takes in all the highlights of this magical region, including one of the best breweries on the East Coast.

<h4>Pululahua Crater Loop</h4>
<p>
<em>By Michael Dammer.</em> Bikepacking veteran Michael Dammer’s latest creation, the Pululahua Crater Loop, may be short in distance, but it&#8217;s big on adventure! Whether you choose to make it a three-day ride, an overnighter, or even a massive day trip, exploring the interior of this enormous crater is not only a delightful biking experience, but it&#8217;s also an amazing introduction to Ecuador&#8217;s unique ecosystems.

<h4>YELLOW RIVER LOOP</h4>
<p>
<em>By Levi Bridges.</em> Iowa is often overlooked as a scenic bikepacking destination, but don’t be fooled. It has a unique beauty of its own.

<h4>Northern White Mountains Loop</h4>
<p>
<em>By Danielle Blanca.</em> The Northern White Mountains Loop connects rail trails, forest roads, and a dash of singletrack, and provides a scenic tour through the Pondicherry division of the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge where ponds, wetlands, and forests support a wide variety of significant ecological features and birdlife. <a href="/routes/northern-white-mountains-loop/">Find the route guide here</a>.</div>

<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Best New Event</h2>
<p class="master_excerpt" style="font-size:.9em;">Our last category honors four new events, all of which had their inaugural running in 2021 or in the case of the winner, chartered a new format in 2021. Further, each serves to grow and foster the bikepacking community at large.</em></p>

<h2>GBduro</h2>
<p><img src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/awards-badge-gold.png" style="float:left; width:70px;height:auto;padding:0 10px 5px 0;"/>The 2020 GBduro took the self-supported element of ultra-endurance races to a whole new level. With COVID-19 in full swing, the organizers decided to challenge participants with a new set of rules that made for a completely self-sufficient race. In 2021, the organizers maintained many of those rules in the name of sustainability and aiming toward a low carbon emissions event. To do so, they imposed strict leave no trace rules for the racers and reinstated the no-fly rule, restricting racers from other countries who couldn&#8217;t reach the start via ground transportation. The &#8220;scrappy rolling picnic&#8221; set new precedents for races of this kind, all while fostering a community atmosphere, an even playing field of men and women, and an extremely exciting dot-watching experience from afar.

<h4>Dead Ends &#038; Cake</h4>
<p>
The inaugural Dead Ends &#038; Cake event brought riders on a 500-kilometer self-supported loop around eastern Switzerland. The hitch? There were five mandatory checkpoints at the far end of dead-end roads, where fresh cake was served. We love themed rides, and who doesn&#8217;t love cake while out bikepacking? It sounded like a fun and very creative event that ultimately brought out an even split field of men and women.

<h4>Women&#8217;s Torino-Nice Rally</h4>
<p>
The Torino-Nice Rally is a 700-kilometer mixed gravel and tarmac ride through the Alps from Turin, Italy, to Nice, France, with 17,500 meters of climbing. There&#8217;s an annual event every September, but this year, Lael Wilcox, Komoot, and Gaby Thompson organized a Women’s Torino-Nice Rally. Twenty women began the ride in Turin together and rode the route self-supported, choosing where and when to eat and sleep every night and how far they want to go every day. We hope to see many more events like this. Find <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/2021-womens-torino-nice-rally-report-1/">Lael&#8217;s report here</a>.</div>

<h4>Good Night 2020</h4>
<p>
We&#8217;re not typically ones to toot our own horn, but when we came up with this idea in the beginning of last December, we didn&#8217;t really know whether folks would be into it. However, growing and nurturing the bikepacking community has always been at our core, so we went for it. Ultimately, thousands registered and participated, which felt amazing. We&#8217;re doing it again, too! We hope you&#8217;ll consider ending 2021 with a night under the stars. <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/good-night-2021/">Check out Good Night 2021 and get signed up</a>. </div>
