<h1>2017 Bikepacking Awards: Film, Photography &#038; Art</h1>
<p>In an effort to recognize all that’s been accomplished in the bikepacking community, here is the first of three presentations honoring the people, teams, brands, and products who we think have impacted 2017 the most. Part One focuses on photography, bikepacking videos, and creative expression that’s helped spread the stoke; efforts that have taught others about parts of the world both near and far, encouraged them to document their own rides expressively, or simply allowed us all to share adventures undertaken by others. </p>
<p>So without further delay, here are our awards for what we what our judges consider to be the  best, most impactful, and/or original photography, video, artwork, and creative documentation from 2017. Each category features four items – one top winner and three honorable mentions. We won’t deny wrestling over each decision… each entry deserves applause, so please take the time to admire and enjoy their creative efforts, just as we have. </p>

<h4>Remote Encounters</h4>
<p> <em>by Jimmy Purtill</em> Jimmy and Pia realized the main thing that kept them in the saddle and out exploring the world was the intimate way in which they connected with people they met along the way. So they decided to start a film project about just that. The second episode of ‘Remote Encounters’ in Austria is a great example. <a href="/plog/remote-encounters-austria/">See our the full story here</a>.</div>

<h4>Given by Mountains</h4>
<p> <em>by Joe Cruz</em> Four riders set out on a 23 day trip across Kyrgyzstan. They rode fat bikes over marshes, through valleys, and atop high passes. This is a film about the beauty of this place and how it remains with them.

<h4>Double Vision</h4>
<p> <em>by Locke Hassett</em> is a &#8220;product of dirt, light, stupidity and celluloid,&#8221; according to the artist. But sometimes good art just happens in a seemingly effortless act of happenstance.

<h4>Wilderness Parking</h4>
<p> <em>by Spencer Harding</em> is far from your typical set of bike tour snapshots. Instead, this series, captured while roaming various National Parks in the western US, is a thought-provoking commentary on access to places and our relationship with wilderness.

<h3>Ring of Fire</h3>
<p><em>By Kim McNett, Bjørn Olson, Salsa Cycles.</em> The Ring of Fire story site is as multimedia as they come. The layered and textured story, recounting a summer fat bike expedition in Alaska, is made up of photography, drawing, graphic design, video, and oral storytelling. If you missed it, go see it, if you saw it, dig in again. You&#8217;re sure to find something you didn&#8217;t before. <a href="http://salsacycles.com/stories/ring_of_fire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s the link</a>.</p>

<h4>Passing Place</h4>
<p> <em>by Whitney Ford-Terry</em> was a summer installation at the Missoula Art Park in an exhibition titled “By the Bike”. Whitney recorded audio from voices in the bikepacking community (Lael Wilcox, Lee Craigie, etc) and set up hammocks – created by Randi Jo Fabrications, DFL Stitchworks, and local framebuilder Marlana Kosky — in which visitors could relax and go on an audio bike tour. <a href="http://www.missoulaartmuseum.org/index.php/ID/2150a96034156116e72d1a1b8a1194e5/fuseaction/exhibitions.detail.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Learn more here</a> and <a href="http://soundcloud.com/whitneft/sets/passing-place" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">listen to the audio here</a>.</div>

<h4>Cielito Lindo (poems from Baja Divide)</h4>
<p> <em>by by Liza Burkin, Illustrations by Ally Mabry</em> While we haven&#8217;t seen this book in person, it gets a ringing endorsement from those who have. Judging from photos, and the poetry and illustrations found <a href="http://www.othethingsyoullfind.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on the website</a> it looks like an incredibly creative way to document a bike journey. Also find more photos of the book <a href="http://instagram.com/p/BZWGK2sF-hK/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by Chris Goodman here</a>.</div>
