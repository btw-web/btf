<h1>The Great American Rail-Trail Route</h1>
<p>The Rail-to-Trails Conservancy (RTC) develops rail and multi-use trails across the United States, and is responsible for over 31,000 miles of trail, plus another 8,000 miles waiting to be built. For over 30 years, the Conservancy has been a key player in all facets of trail development, including community growth, legal work, mapping, and of course, trail building. Back in February, the RTC announced an important step forward in the development of The Great American Rail-Trail, which will span across the United States from Washington, D.C., to Washington State. </p>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://gis.railstotrails.org/grtamerican/" width="300" height="100" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>Just a couple weeks ago, the RTC unveiled the route, completion statistics, and many more details. The route (see interactive map above) will traverse 12 states and the District of Columbia over 3,700 miles (5,954 km). Trail criteria were developed to ensure the Great American Rail-Trail would provide safe, nonmotorized travel on a route that is entirely bikeable. The same criteria specify that the Great America Rail-Trail be one contiguous route that is reasonably direct between Washington, D.C., and Washington State. It will be separated from vehicular traffic—a minimum of 80% initially and entirely separated when the trail is complete. The GART will join existing trails when possible and will serve as a catalyst for local economic development, including services for long-distance bike travelers.</p>

<p>Although The Great American Rail-Trail definitely won&#8217;t be packed full of technical singletrack riding, the tentative route crosses paths with several of our published routes, including the <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/cross-washington-xwa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cross Washington Mountain Bike Route</a>, <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/great-divide-mountain-bike-route-gdmbr/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Great Divide Mountain Bike Route</a>, the <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/bikepacking-nebraska/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">High Plains Byway</a>, and the less documented areas in the central United States. Linking together the preexisting trails that are listed below, and gaining the support of the various states involved, was a massive step in the right direction for the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, and we look forward to seeing how the route develops. This looks like it will be a great opportunity for entry-level overnighters and cross-country bikepacking journeys alike. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Great American Rail-Trail will be a national treasure. It presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create—together—an enduring gift to the nation that will bring joy for generations to come.&#8221; —Ryan Chao, RTC President</p>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3gfc0UhP7fs" width="300" height="100" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>The preferred route, as RTC has dubbed it, will traverse the following 12 states and link many preexisting trails that range from just a couple miles long all the way to 270 miles. Check out the completion statistics and some of the highlight existing trails below: </p>
<h3>Washington, D.C., and Maryland</h3>
<h4>207-miles / 100% complete</h4>

<div class="caption">MD &#8211; C&#038;O Towpath Trail</div>
<p></a></p>
<h3>Pennsylvania</h3>
<h4>172-miles / 94% complete</h4>
<p>Beginning at the Maryland–Pennsylvania border on the 150-mile Great Allegheny Passage, the route travels to Pittsburgh and through downtown on the Three Rivers Heritage Trail.</p>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Three Rivers Heritage Trail:</strong> The 21-mile Three Rivers Heritage Trail evolved from five separate trails and today comprises several unique sections. Most of these segments are riverfront trails along both banks of the three rivers that form Pittsburgh’s famous point: the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio.</li>
<li><strong>Montour Trail:</strong> The 46-mile Montour Trail follows a portion of the old Montour Railroad, which was built between 1877 and 1914 to link the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad with the region&#8217;s many coal mines. Forming a semi-circle around Pittsburgh, the Montour Railroad also connected other railroads, including the Pennsylvania, the Pittsburgh &#038; West Virginia, the Baltimore &#038; Ohio, and the Union. The trail, which now follows this route, is primarily crushed limestone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>West Virginia</h3>
<h4>8.7-miles / 53% complete</h4>
<p>RTC defines the preferred route of the Great American Rail-Trail through West Virginia as 8.7 miles and 53% complete. The only existing trail that will host the Great American in West Virginia is the Panhandle Trail.</p>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Panhandle Trail:</strong> The 29-mile trail heads west from the Pittsburgh suburbs into northern West Virginia, serving as a literal gateway between the states.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ohio</h3>
<h4>334-miles / 67% complete</h4>
<p>The Great American will be hosted by more than two dozen existing trails through Ohio, including:</p>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Ohio to Erie Trail, Ohio:</strong> The 270-mile trail cuts diagonally across the state, connecting two major waterways, the Ohio River in Cincinnati and Lake Erie in Cleveland.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Indiana</h3>
<h4>225-miles / 50% complete</h4>
<p>The Great American Rail-Trail will be hosted by a dozen existing trails through the state, including:</p>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Cardinal Greenway:</strong> RTC’s 2018 Rail-Trail Hall of Fame inductee stretches northwest for 61-miles through rural Indiana, making it the longest rail-trail in the state.</li>
<li><strong>The Nickel Plate Trail:</strong> The 46 mile Nickel Plate Trail traverses rural Indiana from Rochester south to the outskirts of Kokomo, with a short gap in the middle in Peru. The rail-trail runs along the former corridor of the Peru and Indianapolis Railroad chartered in 1846.</li>
</ul>
