<h1>2019 Bikepacking Awards: Film, Photography, Writing, and Art</h1>
<p>Introducing the 5th annual Bikepacking Awards. In an effort to recognize all that’s been accomplished in the bikepacking community this year, here&#8217;s our first of three retrospectives honoring the individuals, teams, brands, and products we believe had the biggest impact in 2019. Part one looks at the photographs, films, writing, and creative expressions that have inspired our community and kept the stoke alive and well. We’re recognizing the efforts that have shown viewers magical parts of our world both near and far, encouraged folks to creatively document their own rides, or simply allowed the rest of us to share in the journey. </p>
<p>Without further delay, here are the awards for what we consider to be the most impactful photography, video, writing, artwork, and creative documentation of the year. Most categories feature one winner and a few honorable mentions. We won’t deny wrestling over each decision, and every entry deserves applause, so please take some time to admire and enjoy their efforts, just as we have.</p>
<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Best Independent Film</h2>
<p><em class="font-serif-ital" style='color:#323444;'>We identified a unique category to provide an additional set of awards this year, beyond the feature films below. These independent films are all self-funded, self-filmed projects.</em></p>
<h2>Bikepacking the Cairngorms: A Father and Son Fatbike Adventure</h2>
<p><em>By Jeremy Janin.</em> Photographer and videographer Jeremy Janin surprised his father with a five-day bikepacking trip along The Cairngorms Loop in the Scottish Highlands. They had everything planned, but nothing went as planned. Congrats to Jeremy for an incredible film that will serve as a treasured memento for decades to come. Read the original coverage and see Jeremy&#8217;s incredible photoset <a href="/plog/bikepacking-cairngorms-film/">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Admissions of an Amateur Bikepacker</h4>
<p> <em>By Ben Johnson.</em> With absolutely zero bikepacking experience, Ben Johnson had a brilliant idea: set out on his first solo adventure in the rugged Peruvian Andes. Along the way he shot this honest and beautiful short film. <a href="/plog/admissions-amateur-bikepacker-film/">Click here</a> for the original coverage, including a Q&#038;A with Ben and a gallery of photos from the trip.</div>

<h4>No Stone Unturned</h4>
<p> <em>By Markus Stitz.</em> Markus Stitz set out on a 10-day bikepacking trip through Kyrgyzstan to prepare for the Silk Road Mountain Race. Along the way he made this film, which features thoughtful narration in the form of a journal entry. What&#8217;s particularly notable about No Stone Unturned is that it was shot entirely on an iPhone.</div>

<div class="embed-container"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m3_LiSTnJDs" width="300" height="100" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<h4>Over The Edge</h4>
<p> <em>By Kyle Hughes.</em> Over the Edge is a short film that captures the moment when a 10-day bikepacking trip through Peru’s Cordillera Blanca goes terribly wrong. As three friends ride along a high singletrack trail, one loses control and falls 30 feet into a ravine below, miraculously surviving. Find our original coverage <a href="/plog/over-the-edge-film/">here</a>.</div>
</div>
<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Best Feature Film</h2>
<p><em class="font-serif-ital" style='color:#323444;'>This year offered a wealth of outstanding films, and we were particularly torn on making a decision in this category. Here are our picks based on lots of discussion and votes by all members of our editorial team.</em></p>
<h2>GBduro</h2>
<p><em>By Rapha/EF Gone Racing.</em> The GBDuro is a 2,000km race devised by The Racing Collective, based on the new GB Divide, which is a mostly off-road bikepacking route that joins the UK’s most southern and northern points. Pro road racer Lachlan Morton set off from Land’s End, not really knowing what was in store, and this film shows what he found. This isn&#8217;t the normal type of film that wins here, but it&#8217;s hard to deny its sheer entertainment value and compelling narrative.</p>

<h4>Holiday in Transylvania</h4>
<p> <em>By Ben Page.</em> Two years after finishing his ride around the world, Ben Page dusts off his bikepacking gear and heads on a short trip to Romania. In <em>Holiday in Transylvania</em>, he reflects on how he&#8217;s able to find the same sense of freedom in a two-week trip that he thought he&#8217;d need to embark on another three-year ride to experience again. We appreciate Ben&#8217;s reminder that not every trip needs to be a massive undertaking to have a big impact.

<h4>Chronicles of Aralar</h4>
<p> <em>By Cass Gilbert.</em> In <em>Chronicles of Aralar</em>, Cass Gilbert and his six-year-old son Sage head to the Spanish Basque Country for their first father-son trip as equal partners, both hauling their own gear as they spin the pedals. We love the way Cass puts Sage&#8217;s sense of wonder into words as they discover the area&#8217;s culture, landscapes, and animals together, giving us a glimpse of bikepacking through a child&#8217;s eyes.
