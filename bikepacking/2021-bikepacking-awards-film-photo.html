<h1>2021 Bikepacking Awards: Film, Photography, Writing, and Art</h1>
<p>To recognize all that’s been accomplished in the bikepacking community this year, here&#8217;s our second of three retrospectives honoring the individuals, teams, brands, and products we believe had the biggest impact in 2021. Part one, <a href="https://bikepacking.com/gear/2021-bikepacking-gear-of-the-year/">Gear of the Year</a>, recognized the gear and products that have impressed us, and part two looks at the films, photographs, writing, and creative expressions that have inspired our community and kept the stoke alive throughout the year. We’re paying tribute to the efforts that have shown viewers magical parts of our world both near and far, encouraged folks to document their own rides, or simply allowed the rest of us to share in the journey. </p>
<p>Without further delay, here are the awards for what we consider to be the most inspiring films, photography, writing, and art of 2021. Most categories feature three winners delineated by gold, silver, and bronze badges. These are ordered by vote count from seven of our editors and closest contributors who submitted blind ballots based on nearly 100 nominations. In addition, find a Collective Choice award for Best Film with votes from the <a href="/join">Bikepacking Collective</a>, our member community. </p>
<p>We won’t deny wrestling over each decision, and every entry deserves applause, so please take some time to admire and enjoy their efforts, just as we have! </p>

<h4>All Bodies on Bikes</h4>

<p> <em>By Anthill Films.</em> Never in the Way is a short film that follows Chicago-based bike messenger and racer Nico Deportago-Cabrera on a meandering ride from Flagstaff to Phoenix, Arizona, that pieces together as many bikepacking routes as possible for a winter getaway. The film beautifully captures the perspective that can be gained through bikepacking and the juxtaposition of the city and the vast Arizonan wilderness.

<h4>The Further Away, The Better</h4>
<p> <em>By George Marshall.</em> Splicing together images of bicycle trips across Iceland in 1933, 1958, 2015, and 2019, <em>The Further Away, The Better</em> focuses on 86-year-old Rough Stuff Fellowship member Ron Bartle as he recounts the tale of his 1958 expedition across the interior of Iceland. This beautifully constructed film evidences how the same spirit lives on today, even though the bikes and gear have changed.

During the tour, he rode the entire 2021 Tour de France route and all the transfers in between, racking up an impressive 5,510 kilometers (3,424 miles) with some 65,000 meters (214,895 feet) of climbing. Not only did he accomplish his goal of finishing the remarkable ride, but he beat the peloton to Paris, despite riding around twice the distance, and raised £500,000 ($688,487) for World Bicycle Relief in the process.

<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Best Writing (Print)</h2>
<p class="master_excerpt" style="font-size:.9em;">Although we think every story that makes it into our biannually printed publication, <em>The Bikepacking Journal</em>, represents the very best in pedal-powered writing and photography, we want to highlight a few of our favorites as we look back on this year&#8217;s issues.</p>
<h3>The Devil&#8217;s in the Details</h3>
<p><em>By Johan Wahl.</em> The opening story in the seventh issue of <em>The Bikepacking Journal</em>, Johan Wahl’s <em>The Devil’s in the Details</em>, offers a fascinating glimpse into Johan’s passion for using Google Earth to create detailed plans for potential trips, some thoughts on how the planning process can be just as enjoyable as the trip itself, and a reminder that some things can simply never be planned for. It’s a feel-good story paired with stunning photography from South Africa. We&#8217;re excited for our Bikepacking Collective members to dive into this one when their copies arrive later this year.</p>

<h4>Where You Lay Your Head</h4>
<p> <em>By Jack Boffy.</em> Shared in the spring issue of <em>The Bikepacking Journal</em>, Jack Boffy takes readers along for a ride from London to Hong Kong and looks back on all of the weird and wonderful places he slept on the way. It&#8217;s equal parts humorous and absorbing—especially with the accompanying illustrations from Dean Liebau.
