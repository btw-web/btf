<h1>2018 Bikepacking Awards: People and Routes</h1>
<p>In parts one and two of our 2018 Bikepacking Awards, we showcased our choices for <a href="/gear/2018-bikepacking-gear/">2018 Gear of The Year</a> and <a href="/plog/2018-awards-film-photography/">Best Bikepacking Videos, Photography, and Art</a>. </p>
<p>For our final awards installment, we celebrate the people who have contributed to our community, whether through their physical achievements, the richness of their storytelling, or their commitment to spreading the word about bikepacking and related causes. Additionally, we both acknowledge and thank BIKEPACKING<em>.</em>com’s route makers for meticulously researching and finely crafting our favorite new bikepacking rides of 2018; from small but perfectly formed weekend escapes that help keep us sane, to overseas odysseys that stoke our desires to explore and understand the world on two wheels. We&#8217;re thrilled to be able to share such a growing resource and we couldn&#8217;t do so without our vibrant, inquisitive, and talented community.</p>

<h3>WTF Bikexplorers</h3>
<p>The WTF Bikexplorers Summit and Ride Series empowered and inspired hundreds of riders this year, and we’re thrilled that an important event like this was met with so much success. A big congrats goes out to the founders, organizers, and marketers behind the Summit and Ride Series: Sarah Swallow, Tenzin Namdol, Molly Sugar, Whitney Ford-Terry, Mary Lytle, and Jocelyn Gaudi Quarrell.

<h3>Mark Watson and Hana Black</h3>
<p>Since 2016, Mark Watson and Hana Black have been on an enormous bikepacking trip, pedaling the length of the Americas, starting in Alaska and making their way down to the southern tip of Patagonia. What sets their trip apart from other pan-American journeys is that they&#8217;ve been hitting all of the most spectacular off-road and singletrack trails along their route, stretching their trip to span an estimated four years. They&#8217;ve been documenting their journey in detail, and creating some of our favorite images and stories of the year. They also put together a piece chronicling three particularly arduous sections of hike-a-bike in the Andes for our first issue of <em><a href="https://bikepacking.com/stories/bikepacking-journal-issue-01/">The Bikepacking Journal</a></em>, contributed the 329-mile <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/ruta-maya-de-los-cuchumatanes/">Ruta Maya de los Cuchumatanes</a> in Guatemala, and they were profiled in an excellent <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/world-ready-mark-and-hana/">short film</a>. Stay tuned for more great content from Mark and Hana as they continue their journey south.</p>

<h4>Taneli Roininen</h4>
<p>
Taneli Roinen is a passionate mountain biker, angler, and outdoorsman who pedaled off for a five-year trip around the world on gravel roads in 2014. Taneli contributed three amazing routes this year, including the doubly epic and mind-bogglingly remote Ruta de Los Seis Miles Norte and Sur in the Argentinian and Chilean Puna. We&#8217;ve been intrigued by Taneli&#8217;s journey through South America – a slow, uncompromising ride north during which no stone has been left unturned. Along the way, he&#8217;s captured imagery of the &#8220;roads&#8221; he unearths and the people he meets in his own unique and highly evocative way. Not only that, but an issue with his heart means that Taneli has to regularly reconnect with doctors to ensure he&#8217;s doing okay. For this reason, he says it&#8217;s likely his last chance to see high mountains, so he aims to &#8220;ride routes as high in the thin air as possible.&#8221; <a href="/author/taneli-roininen/">Check out Taneli&#8217;s routes here</a>.</div>

<h4>Franzi Wernsing and Jona Riechmann</h4>
<p>
Departing from their home in Germany back in 2012, Franzi Wernsing and Jona Reichmann set off on what became a five-year bike trip around the world. Throughout their travels, they traded in their traditional touring set ups for bikepacking rigs (<a href="https://bikepacking.com/gear/bikepacking-bags/panniers-vs-bikepacking-bags/">which they wrote about here</a>), and explored a seemingly endless amount of dirt. That trip came to an end when they returned home in 2017, but the story didn&#8217;t end there. Despite planning to settle down, their restless spirits got the best of them, and earlier this year they set out again to see more of the world from the saddle, pointing their handlebars toward Europe, opting to continue exploring closer to their backyard. Find <a href="https://bikepacking.com/author/tales-on-tyres/">all of their routes and stories here</a>, a peek at <a href="https://bikepacking.com/bikes/franzi-and-her-bombtrack-beyond-plus/">Franzi&#8217;s Bombtrack Beyond+ here</a>, and look out for an upcoming Rider&#8217;s Lens feature showcasing some of her photography soon.</div>

<h3>Ryan Correy</h3>
<p>Ryan Correy was at the forefront of the Canadian bikepacking scene, not only as the founder of Bikepack Canada, but as an extremely accomplished adventure cyclist. This past April, Ryan passed away after a 9-month battle with Stage 4 Colon Cancer. Besides planning and executing North America&#8217;s first Bikepacking Summit back in 2016, he also inspired and assisted in Neil and Lindsay&#8217;s creation of the US Bikepacking Summit. He was dedicated to both the current and future state of bikepacking, and is missed by many. To learn more about Ryan&#8217;s fight and accomplishments, check out <a href="/news/support-ryan-correy/">this post</a> from this February. </p>

<h4>Joel Caldwell</h4>
<p>
While Joel may not be a prominent figure among the usual bikepacking circles, he has made an impact through his conservation photography and storytelling, and more recently, his inspiring comeback after a major setback. Just a year and a half ago, Joel lost his left leg as a result of a motorcycle accident. Since then, with an incredibly positive attitude and a lot of training, Joel is back on the pedals and just returned from a bikepacking trip in Ethiopia. Read about <a href="/plog/joel-caldwell-photography/">his conservation photography here</a> and stay tuned for his upcoming Rider and Rig profile.</div>

<h4>Ben Weaver</h4>
<p>
This year marked the 20th anniversary of the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route. To commemorate the occasion, Ben Weaver rode the entire route and played free concerts along the way to, &#8220;highlight, celebrate, and give back to all the all the individuals and communities who had supported it for the past 20 years.&#8221; The film they made focused on the often overlooked people in the places they rode through, and &#8220;gave voice to a component of nearly every adventure that is often forgotten, the story of the people who helped along the way.&#8221; <a href="/bikes/ben-weaver-salsa-blackborow/">Read more about Ben and his bike here</a>.</div>

<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Ultra-achievers of The Year</h2>
<p><em class="font-serif-ital" style='color:#323444;'>This award is for individuals who aim to compete and progress ultra-endurance bikepacking as a competitive sport and a personal challenge. This year, continuing a rather unconventional selection, we chose to highlight not only the fastest record-setters, but those doing things slightly differently.</em></p>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/alexandra-houchin.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/alexandra-houchin.jpg" alt="Alexandra Houchin" width="1578" height="1052" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50295" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/alexandra-houchin.jpg 1578w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/alexandra-houchin-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/alexandra-houchin-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/alexandra-houchin-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1578px) 100vw, 1578px" /></a>
<h3>Alexandra Houchin</h3>
<p>Just because Alexandra Houchin isn&#8217;t a household name in the ultra-endurance bikepacking scene, doesn&#8217;t mean she&#8217;s not a complete badass. And just because she didn&#8217;t set a bunch of race records doesn&#8217;t mean she hasn&#8217;t earned this award. With nothing to prove, Alex&#8217;s remarkable 2018 season started with an ITT attempt on the AZT, even though she knew it wouldn&#8217;t count. Closures in the Coconino forced a reroute, yet she still knocked out 563.5 miles of the actual route. After that, she took on the Tour Divide, with a finish time of 23:03:51 (1st lady, 24th overall). Moving on, she raced the Colorado Trail Race with a finish time of 6:17:16 (2nd lady, 22nd overall). In Durango, she turned around and attempted a yo-yo of the Colorado Trail, taking a couple detours along the way. After that, she raced the Smoke &#8216;n&#8217; Fire 400, finishing in 3:07:30 (1st lady, 11th overall). Congrats on a year well spent, Alex!</p>

<h4>Jenny Graham</h4>
<p>
Jenny Graham is a 38-year-old endurance cyclist from the Scottish Highlands. On the June 16th, Jenny left from Berlin, riding east. And 125 days later, she pedaled back into Berlin from the west, having ridden some 29,657 kilometers across four continents to become the fastest woman to ride around the world unsupported. The old record of 144 days was nearly three weeks longer, set by Paola Gianotti in 2014. What makes this feat even more incredible is the fact that Jenny is a latecomer to bikepacking. According to the Adventure Syndicate, her first race was in 2015 on The Highland Trail 550. <a href="/plog/jenny-graham-around-world-record/">Read our coverage here</a>.</div>

<h4>Joe Urbanowicz</h4>
<p>
Fifteen-year-old Joe Urbanowicz took on his first bikepacking race this year. And it wasn&#8217;t an easy race, either. Joe finished the 357-mile Trans North Georgia (TNGA) in 73 hours and 21 minutes—and in fifth place overall. But, more importantly, Joe finished with a big smile and said that he’ll be back, adding, “Next year my mom is going to let me ride through the night. I hope to be able to finish a lot faster. Maybe I’ll break the course record.” We&#8217;re excited to see what next year brings for Joe. <a href="/news/joe-urbanowicz-bikepacking-tnga/">Read the report from this year&#8217;s TNGA here</a>.</div>

<h3>SoCal Desert Ramble</h3>
<p>For those seeking desert solitude tinged with a touch of the bizarre, the SoCal Desert Ramble is hard to resist. Created by our own Cass Gilbert (linking several sections of existing routes between San Diego and Los Angeles, including Brendan Collier&#8217;s <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/stagecoach-400-bikepacking-route/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stagecoach 400</a>), the SoCal Desert Ramble immerses riders amongst desert blooms and starry nights. Slither along sandy washes, linger in counter-culture hangouts, ponder salty, decayed holiday resorts, and marvel at the Dr. Seussian splendor of the gangly, anthropomorphic Joshua Tree. It&#8217;s all there. <a href="/routes/socal-desert-ramble/">View the route guide here</a>.</p>

<h4>Iceland Divide</h4>
<p>
Iceland has captured the imagination of intrepid cyclists for years. This past summer, Francesco and Giorgio, aka Montanus, traversed the country by following the fault line that crosses the island from north to south. Dominated by huge glaciers, ashen deserts, and mighty lava structures, the Icelandic Highlands are the work of incessant fire and ice, and contain a world of immeasurable desolation and enthralling beauty. <a href="/routes/iceland-divide/">Check it out here</a>.</div>

<h4>Caucasus Crossing (Armenia)</h4>
<p>
Long in the works, the Armenian leg of the Caucasus Crossing completes the long-distance route through its namesake, an infinitely beautiful mountain range that creates a jagged and varied landscape through the Republic of Georgia and Armenia. The 454-mile (731 km) Armenia portion takes in the sights and culture of this wondrous country as it follows rugged doubletrack, gravel, and livestock trails across the endless ridges of the Caucasus Minor, from the Georgian border to Iran. <a href="/routes/caucasus-crossing-armenia/">View the route guide here</a>.</div>

<h3>Sky Islands Odyssey</h3>
<p>Sarah Swallow&#8217;s Sky Island Odyssey is made up of a West Loop and an East Loop that range in distances from 125 to 170 miles. These route options were designed so that you could enjoy the Sky Islands Odyssey in two separate weekend trips, or a longer 230-mile loop, depending on how much time you have. Each route tells its own story of flora and fauna, land management, and the human and wildlife consequences of the US immigration policies.

The Appalachian Gravel Growler is a 4-6 day bikepacking route that explores North Carolina&#8217;s Appalachian Mountains alongside one of America’s top craft beer destinations. The route is chock full of iconic roads and designed specifically for drop-bar gravel riding. <a href="/routes/appalachian-gravel-growler">Learn more here</a>.</div>

<h4>Ardennes Arbalete</h4>
<p>
The Ardennes Arbalète looks quite enticing, and is another route that&#8217;s highly approachable.

<h3>A (San Rafael) Swell Night Out</h3>
<p>One of our favorite routes from this year was created in a collaboration between Seth Kruckenberg and Patrick Hendry. The route in Utah&#8217;s San Rafael Swell is constructed from a pair of overnight loops. Both share the same start and end point, as well as a main central artery along the Behind the Reef Trail. Rich in both geological and human history, this pair of routes (126 miles total) traverses stunning landscapes forged by dramatic tectonic uplift, numerous remnants of the region’s bygone mining era, and a creek descent sure to entice even the most adventurous riders.

<h4>The Vapor Trail</h4>
<p>
While not a new route, the Vapor Trail is new to our routes map, and is quite a special one. Originally created by Absolute Bikes, this weekend bikepacking loop is based on the longstanding 125-mile race that starts and finishes in Salida, Colorado. It&#8217;s an incredibly scenic, high-altitude route that uses two historic rail grades and ties in some of Colorado’s finest singletrack via the Colorado Trail, Monarch Crest, and Starvation Creek as it tops high passes and traverses historic mining settlements. <a href="/routes/vapor-trail/">View the route here</a>.</div>
