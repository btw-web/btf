<h1>Why Cycles Founder Launches Revel Bikes</h1>
<p>Unlike <a href="/plog/why-cycles/">Why Cycles</a>, a company with a range of titanium bikes that scream bikepacking, the all new Revel Bikes is not really bikepacking brand. However, success begets success, and we&#8217;ve heard that three of their new Rascal 29ers will be in this years Arizona Trail Race. So we thought this was worth sharing.  </p>
<p>After launching two successful hardtail companies — Borealis and Why Cycles (the latter of which is very relevant in the bikepacking world) — Adam Miller started shopping around for a full-suspension trail bike for himself. After test riding every major brand, he hopped on a Canfield Balance at a trade show. After only a few hundred yards of riding, he knew that this relatively unknown system was the suspension he needed in his life. Adam tracked down the brothers and asked if they would be willing to license the suspension design, and right there, Revel Bikes was born. Here are a few more bits from the press release and some photos I snapped of the Rascal yesterday.</p>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Revel_Portrait.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Revel_Portrait-960x640.jpg" alt="Revel Bikes" width="960" height="640" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-53639" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Revel_Portrait-960x640.jpg 960w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Revel_Portrait-512x341.jpg 512w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Revel_Portrait-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Revel_Portrait.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a>
<p>With the mission to create the best trail bikes the world has ever seen and to only make bikes that he wants to ride, Adam set out to assemble his team. He tapped into engineering, carbon fiber layup, sales and marketing expertise from his immediate group of friends that also happen to be wildly successful in their respective fields within the bike industry. Jeremiah Starkey (Rockshox, Trust Performance, Selle Royal) is lead engineer and COO, Jason Schiers (Founder of Enve) is the carbon layup genius. Mike Giese is the team’s Industrial Designer. Two and a half years of development and prototyping has now led us to this day. Revel is leading with two models:</p>
<h2 style="padding-bottom:2px;">Revel Rascal</h2>
<h4>29″ WHEELS / 130MM REAR / 140MM FRONT</h4>
<p>The Rascal is a 130mm travel 29er that Revel claims is just as comfortable on a one-hour lunch ride as it is on all-day wanderings above tree line. Revel calls this sleek looking machine &#8220;mischievously fast, nimble, and adept.&#8221; Revel&#8217;s vision for the Rascal was to deliver a confidence-inspiring and ultra-versatile mountain bike in all applications. The Rascal features a 73mm threaded BB, clearance for 29 × 2.5″ tires, and comes in navy or black colorways.</p>

<h2 style="padding-bottom:2px;">Revel Rail</h2>
<h4>27.5″ Wheels / 165MM REAR / 170MM FRONT</h4>
<p>The Rail is a 165mm 27.5” rig built for big hits and all-mountain riding. The Revel team created the Rail with two things in mind: maximum thrills and climbing hills. The Rail features a 73mm threaded BB, clearance for 27.5 × 2.5″ tires, and comes in Tuxedo Penguin and Mint Chocolate Chip colorways.</p>

<p>Both of these bikes are built around the Canfield Brothers Formula (CBF) based on Center of Curvature (CC) and balances that with the Instant Center (IC). According to Revel, until now most suspension systems have focused solely on the IC. CBF points the chainline and drive forces directly into the IC throughout 100% of the travel by balancing the CC over the chainring, resulting in maximum pedaling efficiency, regardless of where you are in the travel, what terrain you are on, or what kind of power you’re putting down. All the power you put into the pedals propels you one direction–forward—allowing the suspension to do its job completely independent of drivetrain and braking forces, and making the sag setting much less important. When Adam and team first rode the largely-unknown CBF system, they knew it was something special&#8230;</p>
