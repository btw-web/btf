<h1>Ultralight Rain Jackets for Bikepacking and Bike Touring</h1>
<p>Clothing recommendations for inclusion in a minimalist kit is an often debated subject, and a question we&#8217;re regularly asked. Unless the intended adventure location is a bone-dry desert, our answer always factors in an ultralight waterproof jacket. In tumultuous mountain environments, a hardshell can be a crucial means of survival; at the very least, it&#8217;s an added tool to combat cold weather, wind, driving rain, or even persistent drizzle that can leave you in a state of misery. In short, whether you&#8217;re planning a multi-day mountain bike route or a longer tour, a good quality rain shell is a staple.</p>
<h2>An elemental choice.</h2>
<p>Like most bikepacking gear choices, picking the right jacket should be based on where you&#8217;ll be riding — and more specifically, the temperature, humidity, and average rainfall. There&#8217;s a big difference between the technical shell needed for a shoulder-season <a href="/routes/bikepacking-the-colorado-trail/">Colorado Trail</a> traverse, and a jacket fit for the dirt roads of East Africa during the dry season, used only during a few showery afternoons. </p>
<p>For starters, most non-insulated rain shells are either ultra-minimal &#8217;emergency&#8217; jackets meant to broken out for the occasional rain event, performance waterproof jackets made to withstand heavy precipitation, or burly technical shells with added armor to protect against wind and more extreme weather. The jackets we targeted for this review &#8211; indeed, those that we feel are applicable for most multi-day bikepacking trips &#8211; fall somewhere in between these classifications. None are super heavy technical shells, nor are they dainty &#8220;weather-resistant&#8221; jackets. But they do vary, so here are three characteristics that we always bear in mind when offering advice. </p>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-00.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18032" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-00-740x494.jpg" alt="Ultralight Rain Jackets for Bikepacking and Bike Touring" width="740" height="494" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18032" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-00-740x494.jpg 740w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-00-233x155.jpg 233w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-00-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-00-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-00.jpg 1480w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></a>
<h3>Fabric Breathability</h3>
<p>Although we could spend hours geeking out on various hardshell materials, eVent vs H2No vs Paclite, numbers/types of layers, and compiling various acronyms such as PU DWR, we&#8217;ll ignore the details and get straight to the point; there&#8217;s plenty nerdery-laden content out there for detailed investigation. All of the jackets tested here are considered waterproof/breathable. The first of the keywords means that the jacket is not simply &#8220;water resistant&#8221; and won&#8217;t be effective during an excessive soaking rain. Not only should it be waterproof but it should be made with a fabric that is breathable and moves sweat and humidity to the outside, where it belongs. If a hardshell is not breathable, you will get equally as wet from perspiration as you would from the rain. In order to repel precipitation <em>and</em> provide an escape route for perspiration vapor, materials are constructed with laminated layers and/or coated with a liquid solution called a DWR (Durable Water Repellant) finish. There are all kinds of proprietary shell materials on the market. The most common waterproof/breathable fabric is Gore-Tex, and it&#8217;s also the most expensive. Others include eVent, Polartec Neoshell, and Pertex Shield+. OK, we went a little down the rabbit hole, but we&#8217;ll stop there.</p>
<h3>Weight and Packability</h3>
<p>As with any element of a bikepacking setup, the packed size of a jacket is crucial. A heavy technical insulated &#8220;soft-shell&#8221; jacket is too bulky, whereas Gore-Tex Paclite is designed to compress. We looked for shells that roll or fold up very small and preserve precious luggage capacity, preferably in their own stuff-sack. Weight is is of equal importance, so all the jackets we looked at are under 10 ounces, and a couple are under six. Our general rule of thumb is weight and size should correlate with how much you expect to use the jacket and the temperatures where you&#8217;ll be wearing it. As temps go down and wearable time goes up, anticipate packing a more robust jacket; conversely, if you only expect to wear a jacket two or three times a week, perhaps you should choose a minimal option.</p>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-000.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-18177" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-000-740x494.jpg" alt="Ultralight, packable rain jackets for bike touring" width="740" height="494" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18177" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-000-740x494.jpg 740w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-000-233x155.jpg 233w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-000-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-000-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ultralight-rain-jackets-000.jpg 1480w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></a>

<h3>Fit</h3>
<p>Last but not least, consider the fit of a jacket. This is kind of a goldilocks conundrum. If the jacket is too big, it will impede movement; if it&#8217;s too long, it may interfere with the saddle; if it&#8217;s too tight, it may bunch and restrict, and layering for cold will not be possible (another factor where climate comes in to play). So we found that having a fit that&#8217;s on the athletic cut slim side, but has a little wiggle room, makes for an ideal all around jacket. In addition, consider your riding position when trying on jackets. When you reach and bend forward does it constrict, or allow you to move freely?</p>
<h3>Bells and Whistles</h3>
<p>There are a few features that aren&#8217;t necessarily guaranteed on all ultralight rain jackets. Here are a few worth noting. To make it easy to skim each of these jackets, we added a yes/no flag column in the spec list for each of these features.</p>
<p><strong>Hood: </strong>Some people might prefer to get by without, while others prefer the added protection of a hood. Most of these jackets reviewed here in fact have a hood, but there&#8217;s one without, and one with a detachable hood. Here&#8217;s what <a href="/author/joe-cruz">Joe Cruz</a> had to say on the subject, <em>&#8220;For years I wasn’t a hood guy and instead wore a weatherproof cap, but on my most recent bikepacking trips I’ve come around. Many companies have designed their hoods so that they can be worn under a helmet to not restrict movement or vision, and I now consider having the watertight seal behind my neck worth the weight.&#8221;</em> </p>
<p><strong>Hand Warmer Pockets: </strong>If you are one to shuffle around camp, hands in pockets, this might be a necessary feature. But if you strictly use a rain jacket for riding, you may want to choose a streamlined option without pockets. The additional material required adds a little weight and bulk—not much, but every little bit counts.</p>
<p><strong>Pit Zips: </strong>Some jackets have zippered side vents, aka &#8220;pit zips&#8221;, and some don&#8217;t. A lot of folks will argue that this is a necessity to allow more airflow, and zippered vents do indeed allow significant well-placed egress for hot air. But they also require additional zippers which increase the overall package. If you aren&#8217;t a heavy sweater, and plan on riding primarily in cooler and less humid climates, perhaps they aren&#8217;t a necessity.</p>

<h2>7 Waterproof Jackets&#8230; under 10oz/280g</h2>
<p>Which is the best rain jacket for bikepacking? There are ton of great options out there, and we picked a few to put through months of testing to find out. Here are seven ultralight rain shells that pack small and will keep you dry when the weather turns sour&#8230; ordered by weight.</p>
<h3>Endura MTR Emergency Shell</h3>
<p>I’m an enthusiastic fan of Endura’s inclement weather offerings. Their Stealth Lite Tights, for instance, have been a staple on my bikepacking trips for years. It’s easy to imagine their talented designers drawing inspiration for new products while riding under Scotland’s unpredictable skies. More recently I tested the MTR Emergency Shell over the course of a winter bikepacking trip in the American Southwest. We saw a reasonable range of conditions, including cool breezy sunshine days where I wore the piece in the morning and evening as well as snowfield hike-a-bikes with light flurries and precipitation at six-thousand feet where it stayed on longer. The MTR ES was the only shell that I brought and it performed very ably.</p>

</ul>
<p>The most immediate impression is of how startlingly light and compact it is. It squashes down into a pocket or pack more readily than, say, my Gore Bikewear Alp-X 2.0 jacket. Rolled up and secured by the elastic loop hidden under the collar, it is the size of a soda can. That elastic, by the way, is only kept from being a gimmick by the fact that it is handy when assembling gear before you leave home. In practice it wasn’t used much in the field; I tended to turn the jacket inside out while taking it off and just quickly stuff it into my pack.</p>
<p>Worn, the jacket has a welcome trim fit with no flapping or bunching material. The MTR ES sizes run pretty small. I usually wear a size small jacket, but wore a medium MTR ES and that felt about right. It feels comfortable enough against the skin but isn’t anything special. I’d say it’s about standard for a single layer shell. Nor does the material possess any magical breathing properties over other breathable shells. Under high effort I felt the clammy accumulation of moisture in the jacket. And with only the main zipper to vent, I would grade the MTR ES as a bit below average in terms of overall breathability. The jacket does keep you dry from water from outside, though. The fully taped seams do the job and I got no leaks during a snow/drizzle mix. True, the jacket didn’t get tested in a multi-hour downpour. I’ll keep this page updated as I gather more data.</p>

<p>The low-key appearance hides a number of well thought out details. The stretch panels on the shoulders carry through behind the back and go a long way in achieving the terrific fit. The same material at the wrists keep things snug around the forearm. The collar has elastic trim to seal it against the elements when the jacket is fully zipped. The collar is also lined with fleece for warmth and comfort. The back of the jacket drops low to handle spray off the rear tire and features more elastic trim, but it doesn’t gather so tight around the buttocks as to seem like a diaper. I never once caught the zipper on the fabric of the jacket. The reflective accents are sensible. These are very nice touches for a jacket that is aiming at minimalism. That said, in the less than exemplary column, I also found the jacket hard to unzip one handed; the downside of the gathered collar fitting close to your neck is that there’s no obvious place to bite to create zipper tension on the fabric. </p>

<p class="take">&#8220;I would bring this jacket if I were going on a short trip where there was a decent possibility of wind and rain but where I wasn’t anticipating wearing it day after day (for that purpose, there are jackets that, while heavier, have more venting possibilities, more advanced fabrics, and have a hood—something I missed). I admire that Endura isn’t trying to misrepresent this piece. They call it an emergency shell, and I don’t know of a better performing one of those. Honestly, it’s even a little more than that. If this was your only shell because you are obsessed with weight and compactness, or if you reasonably enough only wanted to buy just one shell, that would probably be just fine. The MTR Emergency Shell—like so many of Endura’s products—is functional, durable, and weather-wise. There are rival shells that vent better, have more features, and look better. But if packability and weight are what you are after, or, more pragmatically, if you want to make it impossible ever to have an excuse for leaving a shell behind, this is is a winner.&#8221; &#8211; Joe Cruz</p>

<h3>Outdoor Research Helium II (Women&#8217;s)</h3>
<p>The Helium II is the most lightweight offering in Outdoor Research’s line of jackets and shells. The minimalist design is realized using an ultralight 2.5 layer Pertex Shield+ fabric, fully taped seams, and YKK AquaGuard Zippers. The end result is a ridiculously lightweight jacket that functions beautifully as both a windbreaker and a waterproof shell. Weighing only 5.5 ounces and compressing down to the size of packaged Ramen noodles, the Helium II is a dream come true for any weight and space conscientious bikepacker.</p>

<p>In order to shave off unnecessary weight, the Helium II doesn’t include any of the bells or whistles that you might find in other tech gear. In fact, it is pretty much as barebones as you can get. There are only 2 pockets, a zippered chest pocket and a velcroed inner pocket that also serves as the jacket’s stuff sack. The sleeve design is equally as spartan. Instead of adjustable hook and loops, the cuffs are half-elasticized. And, while many rain jackets have side vents or “pit zips”, this jacket has none. No hand pockets? No vents? I know… deal breakers for some folks. But, for me, the Helium II’s simplicity is nearing perfection. The single chest pocket provided ample space to keep a few small items dry and secure. The half-elastic cuffs held my sleeves securely in place without cutting off any blood supply. And, the jacket felt amazingly breathable despite the absence of pit-zips. Did I mention the jacket was tested in humid equatorial East Africa?  </p>

<p>Another seemingly simple but thoughtfully engineered element of the Helium II is its hood. The hood, which is large enough to fit over a helmet, has an elastic pull-tab and toggle at the back for cinch adjusting its fit. It is cut wide enough, with slightly receding sides, so that peripheral vision is unencumbered. To top it off, the slightly stiffened brim stays in place while riding. </p>
<p>Unlike other rain jackets I’ve worn, the Helium II is really comfortable. Instead of feeling like I’m performing “The Robot” for anyone who might be watching, I can actually move my limbs freely. The length provides OK rear coverage without interfering with hip flexure. And, the elastic drawcord hem has a single toggle for adjusting waist fit. </p>

<p class="take">&#8220;I had my doubts about this jacket. 5.5 ounces, 100% waterproof and super-breathable&#8230; way too good to be true. But the Helium II provides outstanding weather protection and seemingly good breathability in an amazingly lightweight package. Although we didn’t experience very much rain in Uganda, the wet season started a little earlier than I had anticipated <a href="/routes/congo-nile-trail/">in Rwanda</a>. The rains are torrential, albeit short-lived, and ducking for cover isn’t always an option. Although I would have liked it more with pit zips, if you are looking for a very minimal and ultralight rain jacket to provide protection from afternoon storms, or as an added layer for cold, the Helium II is a solid option.&#8221; &#8211; Virginia Krabill</p>

<h3>Outdoor Research Helium II (Men&#8217;s)</h3>
<p>This will be short; the men&#8217;s version of the Helium II is almost identical to the Women&#8217;s, reviewed above. Skip to the &#8216;Take&#8217; below to hear a few additional thoughts.</p>
<p>Also, I will add a bit about Pertex Shield+. This is a fabric which uses a polyurethane film coating for a very high waterproof rating. It&#8217;s also known to have good levels of breathability in addition to being very lightweight and packable. Overall it has a nice feel, although it seems a little less robust than Paclite or H2No. But considering the fact that it costs less, and performs very well, it seems like a great alternative.</p>

<p class="take">&#8220;I agree with most of what Virginia had to say regarding the Helium II. I haven&#8217;t spent as much time with it as she, but I might add a few points. First, I also love the simplicity of this jacket, but I am known to sweat profusely and unless it&#8217;s under 60°F outside, pit-zips are a must. I tested a medium which is my size of choice for outer layers; it fits well, but I might suggest that it runs a tad short. I have a relatively short torso, so it&#8217;s actually perfect for me, but anyone with a longer torso might size up. Ideally OR would make it with a more angled waste similar to the Endura reviewed above. One feature they didn&#8217;t leave out, which I really like, is the reinforced hood brim; you can flip it to wear under your helmet, or leave it out off the bike. Overall the Helium II is a great value with high performance in a small package, and its weight is barely noticeable in the handlebar bag.&#8221; &#8211; Logan Watts</p>

<h3>Montbell Versalite</h3>
<p>The Montbell Versalite is a full-featured waterproof jacket under 7oz that retails for 150 bucks. I could probably leave this review at that, but let me expound. In order to create an ultralight waterproof jacket with hand pockets, pit-zips, a hood, and full adjustability, Montbell constructed the Versalite from 15 denier Super Hydro Breeze. This fabric isn&#8217;t considered as air permeable as other performance waterpoof-breathable materials, but it&#8217;s pretty good, and is indeed waterproof.</p>

<p>To offset the slightly less breathable fabric, Montbell added two 8&#8243; pit-zips. For folks who sweat heavily, these make the Versalite is a great choice on the ultra-lightweight and packable end of the spectrum. Pit-zips aren&#8217;t the only added feature that it offers over the OR jacket reviewed above; in addition, at just 12 grams (.4oz) over the Helium II (men&#8217;s medium), it also has adjustable velcro cuffs and hand warmer pockets, granted they pockets are the only two on the jacket. Although I like having hand pockets, sometimes, I&#8217;d prefer an internal chest pocket to stash my phone during a rain event.</p>
<p>Fitting its name, Montbell also stacked the Versalite with features for adjustability. I already mentioned the velcro cuffs, but it&#8217;s worth noting that they are also half-elastic, which makes them all the more easy to maneuver. The Versailte also has a waist drawcord which can be tightened from the waist pockets and loosened from inside the jacket. The smallish hood won&#8217;t fit over a helmet, but I found it perfect for under the helmet operation; it has a dual-sided drawcord as well as a rear tightening cord. All these features add to it&#8217;s fit, which I was impressed with anyways. It is fairly slim fitting, but not to tight, and like the Torrent Flier reviews below, it allows body movement with a nice athletic design. It also has an angled waist, good for the bent pedaling position.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about the versatile, as well as the Torrent Flier, is their packability and included stuff sack. As shown above, it has two drawstrings that can be swapped. If you want it longer and skinner, use the outer, for a bulkier, short pack, use the inner drawstring. You can also remove one altogether, in case you are the kind of gem-counter who saws off the end of a toothbrush to shave weight.</p>

<p class="take">&#8220;Out of several choices, the Versalite is the jacket I chose to bring on the <a href="/routes/trans-uganda/">Trans-Uganda</a> and <a href="/routes/congo-nile-trail/">Congo-Nile Trail</a> bikepacking trip, for pretty obvious reasons. The Versalite is unbelievably lightweight and I require pit-zips. While in Rwanda, the rainy season was starting, so almost every afternoon included a heavy deluge; we usually sometimes ducked for cover, but there were several days where I wore it while riding for a significant time and stayed completely dry. I also used it to layer up during a couple nights above 8,000&#8242;. Overall it performed without a fault for both of these conditions; it held out the moisture surprisingly well without becoming a sweatbox, and was comfortable as a layer to wear around camp.&#8221; &#8211; Logan Watts

<h3>Patagonia M10</h3>
<p>Given how much good gear there is on the market, we tend not to write reviews for products that simply don&#8217;t work. However, while unsuited to bikepacking, we&#8217;ve left in Patagonia&#8217;s M10 to illustrate the importance of fit. Just to preface, it&#8217;s an extremely impressive jacket on paper, suited to a wide variety of uses. Just not cycling. For this reason &#8211; along with the limited testing period which the sample was available to us &#8211; we&#8217;ve kept our words brief. </p>

<p>Our main gripe was the length of the jacket, and particularly how it could catch the rear of the saddle. The model shown in these photos is a medium, which seemed to run a hair large. But this jacket is cut so long that even a small may have had the same issue. Granted, it could be cinched it around the waist, eliminated the problem to some degree. But for ventilation and feel, a cinched waistband is never ideal when cycling, and besides, it even felt long while walking around too. </p>
<p>Overall the M10 has a decent feature set that includes hook-and-loop cuff closures, a drawcord hem, a single-pull adjustable hood, a watertight chest pocket&#8230; and it stuffs into its own inner chest pocket. But even solid features in an amazingly lightweight package, it just doesn&#8217;t seem fit for bikepacking. In short, unless you have a really long torso, or you&#8217;re an alpine climber or backpacker to whom the jacket is marketed, the M10 is not the ideal choice.</p>

<p class="take">Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the Patagonia M10 is a slick jacket. The H2No fabric has a really nice tactile quality and the finish and details of the jacket are very polished. Overall its streamlined features make it small and light enough to to pack small, and with advanced H2No fabric it should be, as Patagonia puts it, &#8220;a study in minimalism and performance&#8221;. But as mentioned, depending on your build and taste, it may not be a good choice for cycling. Do know that it&#8217;s marketed as an alpine climbing jacket, and could indeed be perfect for that exploit.&#8221; &#8211; Logan Watts</p>

<h3>Montbell Torrent Flier</h3>
<p>When temps drop in an alpine thunderstorm at 10,000 ft or wind-driven rains hit hard in a shoulder-season, this is the shell you’d want to have on hand. The Torrent Flier features a 12 denier Gore-Tex Paclite membrane and delivers solid waterproofing and good wind protection. But equally as likeable is that at 9oz, it’s one of the lightest and most packable semi-technical rain shells on the market. And it accomplishes this without losing 15-inch pit zips, a generous chest pocket, velcro/elastic cuffs, a waist drawcord, and two-way hood adjustability.</p>

<p>But there are tradeoffs. It has just one chest pocket, and lacks hand-warmers, which may be a deal breaker for some. Like the Versalite, the hood lacks heavy brim, although it does have a very minimal bit of heavier material there. And there is not much of an extended brim, which is good for under the helmet operation, but not so much off the bike. Surprisingly, the ultralight weather resistant &#8220;Aqua-Tect&#8221; zippers feel extremely sturdy; I could literally feel them closing as opposed to some other weather zippers.</p>
<p>The Torrent Flier has a similar fit to that of the Versalite, not too bulky but allows a good range of motion. It&#8217;s close to perfect, although for skinner guys it could be slightly slimmed down. It also has a small hood that fits well under the helmet and a gently angled hem that’s good for a pedaling stance.</p>

<p class="take">In my opinion, the Torrent Flier competes with ultralight technical jackets out there, such as the M10 and shells from Arc&#8217;teryx and Mountain Hardware. And for an hardshell at this level, the Torrent Flier seems like a really good value. You will be very hard pressed to find a sub 10oz Gore-Tex jacket for a similar price. My biggest complaint would be the lack of hand warmer pockets. But as a true minimalist hardshell, the Torrent Flier is a great choice when low weight and packability is as high a priority as all-weather protection.&#8221; &#8211; Logan Watts</p>

<h3>Acre Meridian, Alpine Edition</h3>
<p>Acre’s Meridian is a minimal shell made from Polartec Neoshell, a technical material claimed to be especially breathable, waterproof and form fitting. As sleek as it is &#8211; especially in stealth urban black- there’s no shortage of detailing within. The Meridian includes a front pocket on the chest and pockets on either side. The iPhone-sized inner compartment features a headphone port to keep tunes piped unobtrusively into your ears. Meanwhile, elasticated thumb loops keep H2O ingress at bay, while two generous underarm zips maintain airiness on climbs. The hood is easily removable &#8211; note that it’s unusually large, designed to fit over a helmet, rather than under one, with a adjustable cord to tighten it into place. Good for on the bike, less so for sauntering around town. This said, the Meridian&#8217;s low key branding certainly suits urban outings; you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to even see the Acre emblem on the sleeve, which will certainly appeal to some. Fit wise, the jacket runs a little small, so you&#8217;ll probably want to size up. </p>

<p>The taped seams are immaculate, and the general feel of the jacket exudes undisputed quality. Which is just as well, as here comes the Meridian’s most eyebrow-raising feature: its price tag, ringing in at a cool $455. Yes, it’s made in Canada, using premium materials; if supporting products made close to home is important to you, this may go some way towards justifying its expense. But still, however you look at it, nigh on $500 (inc tax) is lot of cash for what is effectively a lightweight waterproof shell; especially when compared to the most technical, 3-ply mountaineering jackets from the likes of Arc&#8217;teryx.

<p class="take">I have to be honest. Even appreciating the value of high quality, North American made gear, I couldn’t personally justify the Meridian; it feels overpriced by at least a $100, and I&#8217;m just too hard on clothing to make such an investment. But that’s not to say I don’t like it. I do, and a lot. In fact, the Meridian&#8217;s the nicest shell I’ve tried. It&#8217;s kept me toasty warm during a cold and snowy New Mexican winter, and while I haven’t had the opportunity to test it in truly torrential conditions, I&#8217;ve been bone dry on the cusp of a Bolivian rainy season. As someone who tends to overheat, I&#8217;ve appreciated the armpit vents, and found the jacket relatively breathable, as much as any technical fabric really is out in the real world &#8211; ie as long as the ambient conditions aren’t too humid, and the pores aren’t clogged up with dirt. Above all, I love the slim, clean, bike-friendly cut; this is a jacket that feels great to ride in. In terms of bikepacking, only the side pockets leave something to be desired, positioned as they are further back than normal. They’re fine for storing gloves and the like, but awkwardly placed if you like to mooch around camp with your hands in your pockets, as I do.&#8221; &#8211; Cass Gilbert</p>

<h3>The Best of The Best?</h3>
<p>Sorry to let you down, there&#8217;s not really an overall &#8216;best&#8217; here&#8230; but we do have a few favorites, for various reasons. For rough all-weather use, we really like the Acre Meridian. Yes, it&#8217;s extremely pricey. But it&#8217;s also a great product &#8211; and it&#8217;s made in Canada. </p>
<p>For those of us watching our dollars, the Montbell Torrent Flier certainly holds its own in big weather. For even better value, the Montbell Versalight is an incredible small-packing option, yet it still has pit-zips and hand pockets, all for $149. Finally, for the minimal purist, it&#8217;s hard to beat the size, weight and level of protection that the OR Helium II offers.</p>
<p><em>We obviously couldn&#8217;t try every jacket on the market for this roundup; so if you have a recommendation for a sub 10oz waterproof/breathable shell, leave your thoughts in the comments below. If you do, please leave 2-3 sentences explaining why you like it, and details including shell material, hood (Y/N), pit zips (Y/N), hand pockets (Y/N), and weight. Thanks! </em></p>
