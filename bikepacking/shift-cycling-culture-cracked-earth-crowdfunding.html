<h1>Help Fund Shift Cycling Culture&#8217;s Cracked Earth Film</h1>
<p>Expected to be released in September of this year, <em>Cracked Earth</em> is a film project from Shift Cycling Culture that captures the lives of passionate cyclists who are living in environmentally vulnerable areas around the world. In the face of the ongoing climate crisis, the riders highlighted in the film share their love for cycling and their concerns about the future of the places they ride. </p>
<p>Watch the sneak peek video below a preview of the people and locations that will be featured in the video, followed by an appeal for support from the team at Shift Cycling Culture and links to donate to their crowdfunding campaigns.</p>

<p><strong><em>Statement from Shift Cycling Culture:</em></strong></p>
<p>Shift Cycling Culture is a non-funded, not-for-profit foundation, run by a small team of enthusiasts with an intrinsic motivation to bring our worldwide cycling community together in positive climate action.</p>
<p>We strongly believe film can help us reach and engage more cyclists around the globe who believe things can be done differently. With more care, and less impact on the places we love to ride. By supporting this film, by sharing it and talking about it, you will help us to unite this wonderful cycling community to step up in this climate crisis. A crisis that is happening in all our backyards! </p>
<h4>Why we need your support</h4>
<p>We feel passionate about this project and we’ve so far put all our energy, friends’ favours, resources,  as well as highly valued first donations of our friends at PEdALED and Komoot, into capture the three storylines of the film, getting us over halfway to the final product. But we’re not there yet. And that’s where we need your help. </p>
<h4>What your donation will be used for</h4>
<p>Our goal is to share this project with as many cyclists as we can, but for that we need to finish it first of course! Your donation is important because it will cover the costs associated with post-production (editing, scoring,  grading, sound mixing, graphics) and distributing this film to a global audience. It will give us the opportunity to engage and educate more people and create climate awareness in the cycling community by organising local screenings and extra action tools.</p>
<p>Our target is based on the very minimum we would need to at least finish this film. This means we do hope we will exceed the target to be able to add some activities around release, as well as cover some additional costs in (post-)production and distribution. If we would exceed the target by more than 50%, Shift will direct all remaining funds towards our other community engagement projects as listed on our website. </p>
<p>But most of all we hope you will embrace this film. Make it yours, as much as it is ours. It’s our generation that is facing this major existential challenge, but it’s also our generation that has the opportunity to become the one that changed things around. </p>
<p>We love where we ride. Let’s act accordingly!
