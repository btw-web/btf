<h1>Time to Vote</h1>
<p>Election day in the United States is <em>finally</em> here. And this year&#8217;s election couldn&#8217;t be more consequential. Although our readers may have opposing views when it comes to some of the issues defining this election, there is one issue upon which all of us should agree: the environment and its protection. And, as outdoor and adventure enthusiasts, we should defend the protected lands that we all cherish.</p>
<p>There are a slew of elected officials in office, both state and federal, who have all but waged war on protected lands. All told, they have removed or are removing protections on approximately 35 million acres, an area roughly the size of Florida. In just the past week, the Roadless Rule that had protected 9.2 million acres of land in the Tongass National Forest from development was fully repealed, <a href="https://www.trcp.org/2020/10/29/major-conservation-rollbacks-finalized-alaska-despite-opposition-hunters-anglers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">despite opposition from outdoors enthusiasts</a> and conservationists alike. </p>
<p>Rest assured, should these officials win another term, they&#8217;ll continue to promote the interests of the fossil fuel and natural resource extraction industries to the detriment of the environment and the lands that we cherish. For all of us here at BIKEPACKING.com, this is a defining issue—we must preserve the incredible natural places on this planet to pass on to future generations.</p>
<h3>What can you do?</h3>
<p>Stay informed. Join a national or local conservation organization. Volunteer your time. Talk to your neighbors, friends, and family about the issues. Write letters and call your local, state, and national representatives. Run for office. Voice your opinions&#8230; and, of course:</p>
<div class="spotlight">
<h2>VOTE!</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not too late to do your part. If you received a mail-in ballot and have not yet returned it, please return your ballot in person. Each state has its own laws regarding the cut-off date for receiving mail-in ballots, but with so much on the line, and so little time, it&#8217;s best to avoid mailing them at this point. Hand deliver your ballot to your local Board of Elections office. In some states, you can deliver your ballot to a precinct or official ballot box, but state laws vary. Please check at <a href="https://www.usa.gov/election-office" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">your state&#8217;s Board of Elections website</a> for details.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t returned your mail-in ballot, you can vote in-person instead. You just can&#8217;t do both (despite suggestions given by the current POTUS). <a href="https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/find-your-polling-place" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Find your local polling place here</a>.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t registered to vote, it may not be too late. Nineteen states plus the District of Columbia have same day registration (SDR), which allows any qualified resident of those states to register and cast a ballot all in the same day. Please check your state&#8217;s Board of Elections website for details as laws vary by state.</p>
<p>If you are unsure of your precinct, call your local board of elections or <a href="https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">use this website</a> to check your registration status and precinct information.
