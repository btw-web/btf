<h1>Raffle Roundup: Cycling Brands Raising Money for Good</h1>
<p>As many of us begin making plans or taking action to contribute to the fight against systemic racism in the United States, several small companies throughout the bikepacking community are holding fundraisers to collect money for various groups across the country. All of these raffles are opportunities to support social justice organizations that are in need, while at the same time having a chance to win great prizes. </p>
<p>We listed some of the groups we’re supporting in <a href="/plog/black-lives-matter/">Tuesday&#8217;s post</a>, and we encourage all of you to make a small donation of time or money to groups working in your community if you can. Taking part in one of the raffles listed here can help do a lot of good, too.</p>
<p>For anyone without the means to give financially right now, we also want to suggest reviewing this <strong><a href="https://tinyurl.com/antiracistresourceguide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anti-Racism Resource Guide</a></strong> that we&#8217;ve been working our way through. It includes a number of film, podcast, article, and book recommendations, along with lots of other resources that are worth checking out.</p>
