<h1>First Look: Surly Karate Monkey 27.5+ &#038; 2017 Troll</h1>
<p>Surly&#8217;s didn&#8217;t bother changing the perfectly retro logotypes on these two iconic rigs, but in reality the the trail slaying Karate Monkey and the dirt touring Troll each received a complete overhaul, from the dropouts up. Both of these bikes were designed with bikepacking in mind. In our first installment from Saddledrive, QBP&#8217;s annual media and dealer event held in Truckee, CA, we take a look at these two bikes and offer a few thoughts after riding them on some of Northstar&#8217;s finest.</p>
<h2>The All-new Surly Troll</h2>
<p>With a standards drunk bike industry, and consumer base squabbling over the best tire size and the ideal trail geometry, some folks might gloss over the steadfast Troll. However, it shouldn&#8217;t be ignored. Having ridden the original Troll from Mexico to Panama, I took particular interest in Surly&#8217;s long awaited redesign. While their original intent was to create a simple bike, in the purest sense of the term — and that they did — the Troll ultimately became the go to rig for long distance dirt expeditions. Folks have used the Troll on everything from around the world odysseys, to <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/bikepacking-the-cdt/">epic trips on the Continental Divide Trail</a>. Along the way, Surly took notes and answered with a well thought out sequel.  </p>

</ul>
<p>All of the tweaks to the Troll are based on making the perfect useable — and developing country proof — bicycle for seeking out long and far dirt roads. The most obvious change is in the Troll&#8217;s geometry. While it&#8217;s still based on the original lines, it&#8217;s no longer suspension corrected. This afforded a few inches of exposed head tube and makes room for a larger frame bag. The Troll also uses the 145mm Gnot-Boost dropouts. Using their 10/12 spacers and clever new thru-axle, the Troll can pretty much fit any mountain bike hub whether it be a worldwide universal 135mm QR, a newer 12 x 142mm thru-axle, or an even newer 12 x 148mm Boost hub. Futhermore, Surly resurrected the Alex Adventurer rims for the Troll as the Adventurer 2, a 36h bombproof rim with the emergency bailout option for rim brakes!</p>
<p>In terms of tire potential, the chainstay yoke has been redesigned to be fully compatible with 26+ tires, such as Surly&#8217;s 3&#8243; Knard, or a the new Ranger+ 26&#215;3. The dropouts still have all the accoutrements allowing disc brakes, fenders, a Rohloff, and racks. It also comes with more braze-ons than you can shake a stick at – including the battle club looking fork legs, each with two sets of triple bottle mounts and rack mounts; there are also two more triple bottle mounts on the down tube.</p>

<p>On my initial test ride of the Troll, I started up a gravel road expecting a tame and mundane ride. I thought I&#8217;d eventually turn around, ride down some more gravel and maybe catch a little easy singletrack at the bottom. Instead I kept going and eventually dropped in on a fairly technical chunky trail that wove through rocky and dusty terrain more fitting for a full-suspension bike or solid hard tail. I grinned the whole way as I methodically picked my way down and marveled at the stability and capability of a bike that was built to do everything, and do it well. Additionally, I was surprised at how well the <a href="https://bikepacking.com/gear/surly-extraterrestrial-tires/">ExtraTerrestrial tires</a> did on loose dirt. Even though they&#8217;re slick by comparison to most knobbies, they can certainly hold their own as a do-all tire.</p>
<p>Honestly, if the world collapsed in some sort of Mad Max scenario, and I could pick only one bike to roam the Earth, it might just be the Troll. It&#8217;s a do-all bike that rises above all standards, and is comfortable, stable, and a whole lot of fun whether trail riding, grocery getting, or circumnavigating the globe.</p>

<h2>Karate Monkey 27.5+</h2>
<p>Originally introduced at the 2002 Interbike trade show, the Karate Monkey was one of the first commercially available 29ers on the market. Prior to its release, 29ers were more of a cult item, created for outliers by small frame builders. According to Surly, &#8220; didn’t create the 29er category, but it helped bring it to the masses and set the standard for what a 29er could be.&#8221; 27.5+ tires have the same rolling diameter as a 29” wheel, so it was only fitting that Surly used the KM as their 27.5+ flagship. </p>

<p>Of course the Karate Monkey has seen a couple of tweaks and changes over the years, but this is probably the most significant revamp. In addition to added clearance for 27.5+ tires, the Karate Monkey also got a makeover that includes a new trumpeted tube set — like that of the Instigator — for added strength and stiffness. The frame was completely redesigned with a modern and progressive trail geometry provided by a longer top tube and 69° head angle. It also received a few additional modern touches such as internal dropper post routing, a 30.9 seatpost internal diameter, and new dropouts. Similar to the Wednesday, the Karate Monkey&#8217;s <em>Gnot-Boost</em> rear dropouts are indeed not 148mm Boost. They’re also not 142mm, the previous standard. Instead, the dropout spacing measures 145mm and can be slightly expanded to fit a Boost hub, or clamped to fit a 142mm hub. Surly also includes a new thru-axle (photos below) with a clever sliding cap system to work with both 142 and 148mm hubs. Furthermore, Surly offers 10/12 adapter spacers to allow the use of a 135mm QR hub. Additionally, the included suspension corrected rigid fork has 110mm Boost spacing and can easily be swapped for a 120 or even 140mm fork.</p>

<p>The Karate Monkey was the first bike I demoed at Saddledrive, and perhaps one of my favorites. Like the Krampus, it has a nice long and low stance that begs to be pushed and ridden aggressively. But with smaller wheels it certainly possesses a slightly more nimble feeling. Also like the Krampus, the rigid 4130 Natch chromoly frame and fork combined with plus tires soaks up a lot of the trail chatter and inspires a fluid style of riding. The new 27.5&#215;3 Dirt Wizards kept everything in check on the rocky and crumbly terrain around Truckee. </p>
<p>If you are on the hunt for a 27.5+ trail bike that doubles as a bikepacking rig, there are a lot of options out there right now. The Karate Monkey should definitely be one that&#8217;s on your list. It&#8217;s a fun bike that is certainly built for trail riding, but with the added utility in all the right places, it makes a great choice for long trips as well.</p>
