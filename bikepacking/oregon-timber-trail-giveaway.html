<p>The Oregon Timber Trail Alliance, a group of volunteers responsible for everything Oregon Timber Trail (OTT) related, has some big plans for the iconic 670-mile backcountry mountain bike route. What you may not know is that there are many people dedicating a lot of time to the maintenance and evolution of the trail, and due to the length and remote nature of it, it&#8217;s hard work! The Alliance has been busy running stewardship events, educational programming, and building new trails, and is looking to keep things rolling and fund the next phase of the OTT.</p>
<p>Lucky for us, they are offering a pretty sweet deal that&#8217;s pretty hard to pass up. Simply <a href="https://oregontimbertrail.org/giant-trance-giveaway" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">purchase a limited edition sticker sheet</a> to get your name entered in a draw for one of two prize packages. A $10 sticker sheet will get you one entry into the draw, while the $25 bonus sticker pack will triple your chances at the grand prize. Winners will be announced on September 12th at their events at Base Camp Brewing in Portland and LOGE Entrada in Bend, where there will be an additional $1,000 worth of prizes up for grabs. Check out the complete prize details below&#8230;</p>

<h3>Oregon Timber Trail Updates for 2019</h3>
<p>Although there haven&#8217;t been many big changes to the OTT route or guide, the Alliance has developed and tweaked some online resources that will make tackling the route that much easier. We&#8217;ve summarized these developments below. Keep in mind, these are are specific to the <a href="https://oregontimbertrail.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oregon Timber Trail</a> website, and separate from our <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/oregon-timber-trail/">Oregon Timber Trail Route</a> found on BIKEPACKING.com.</p>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Water Resupply Chart and Waypoints:</strong><br />
A publicly editable spreadsheet for each water source on the trail. Check it out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wQL_fIEs_ScYDE1S-1NO2rlxy5yf7A47wphCC35y_Pc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and add your notes in the rightmost columns where you’ve ridden the trail.</li>
<li><strong>GPS Route Accuracy:</strong><br />
In several areas there have been slight adjustments to the accuracy of the GPS files where noted by 2018 riders. Specifically in Seg 1, Seg 3, Seg 5, Seg 6, Seg 9, and Seg 10.</li>
<li><strong>Metolious-Windigo:</strong><br />
In Segment 6 we were asked not to utilize the shared-use Metolius-Windigo trail due to perceived conflict. You can read more about this decision <a href="https://oregontimbertrail.org/blog/2019/7/3/why-does-the-deschutes-tier-keep-changing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Elevation Profiles:</strong><br />
Elevation profiles have been added for each segment in the route guide PDF—this paints a much clearer picture of the ride’s difficulty.</li>
<li><strong>Color Coding:</strong><br />
The color-coded route in Ride with GPS was helpful so it&#8217;s accuracy has been re-analyzed and updated. <span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue</span>=Trail, <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Pink</span>=Gravel, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Red</span>=Pavement</li>
<li><strong>Guide Updates:</strong><br />
We added more information to the downloadable route guide that covers: Northbound vs Southbound, concerns about wildlife, more accurate ratings and descriptions, elevation profiles for each segment, and trail log locations. Download this guide <a href="https://oregontimbertrail.org/ride-the-ott" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
