<h1>Wolf Tooth Headsets Now Offered in Two Bearing Options</h1>
<p>I installed a Wolf Tooth headset on <a href="/plan/gear-lists/logans-kona-sutra-ltd/">my Kona Sutra LTD</a> over a year ago and have since put well 1,000+ miles on it, over half of which was accrued on our rugged and rainy trip through Colombia&#8217;s Paramos. As expected, the headset has performed smoothly and flawlessly, with no issues to speak of. I just found out that Wolf Tooth announced two choices for headsets and bearings: Premium Headsets with stainless steel Enduro bearings, which is what I have been running, and Performance Headsets with black oxide bearings. The addition of the black oxide bearings creates another pricing option that&#8217;s about half the cost of the premium headset. All existing sizes of External Cup, Integrated Standard, and Zero Stack headsets are available with the new bearing selection.</p>

<p>Like most of their parts and components, both lines of Wolf Tooth headsets are designed, engineered, and machined in Minneapolis, Minnesota using aircraft-grade 6061 aluminum. The previous line of Wolf Tooth Precision Headsets (with stainless steel Enduro bearings) are now labeled as Wolf Tooth Premium Headsets. According to Wolf Tooth, these are extremely resistant to corrosion and will last the lifetime of your bike with proper care. The new Wolf Tooth Performance Headsets feature black oxide Enduro bearings, which are steel bearings with a black oxide coating to reduce corrosion. All Wolf Tooth headsets have custom seals for a tight, secure fit to keep out moisture and contaminants. The bearings themselves also have two silicone dual-lip seals to further keep the elements away from the interior.</p>

<p>There are a couple other differences that separate the two headset lines. Premium Headsets have three stack height options for the upper top covers and a lifetime warranty. These retail at $59.95-$64.95 USD for uppers and $39.95-$54.95 for lowers. Performance Headsets have just one stack height option for the upper top cover and a one-year limited warranty. They retail at $39.95-$44.95 for uppers and $19.95-$34.95 for lowers. Both are available in nine colors, including the purple color I chose for the Sutra.</p>
