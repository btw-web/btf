<h1>SANS Meal Bars: Just the Good Stuff</h1>
<p>Recently, it seems like there&#8217;s been an influx of &#8216;real&#8217; trailside snacks and bars available. Conscious eating is no longer a fad, and although not everyone is interested in making their own energy bars or foraging for the best mushrooms, it&#8217;s nice to know we have options. SANS is one of those. </p>
<p>The California-based food company has made it their mission to produce real food with no added or artificial sugars, chemicals, or ingredients you can&#8217;t pronounce, while also addressing the issue of global hunger. The SANS <em>Buy Meals, Give Meals</em> program provides a meal for someone in need every time a pack of their meal bars is sold, an initiative that&#8217;s easy to get behind. All of their meal bars are added sugar free, dairy free, soy free, gluten free, and still pack a healthy punch of calories, protein, fat, and carbs. Compared to other bars available, SANS Meal Bars are higher in calories and have more natural fats for a longer burning fuel—perfect for riding bikes all day.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;ve been pretty impressed with the SANS Meal Bars. I&#8217;ve brought one or two along on nearly every ride in the last couple of weeks and on multiple occasions Emily and I have opted to split a single bar between us. Knowing the ingredients are all real food and there are nearly 400 calories in each bar is satisfying, too. </p>
<p>In terms of taste, they fall somewhere in between a Larabar and a Cliff Bar. They aren&#8217;t overly sweet, due to their lack of added sugars, and are softer and less chewy than a Larabar. Although the different flavours have their own unique profile, they have a consistent taste to the point that if you like one type, you&#8217;ll probably like all of them—which could be a good or a bad thing. Some people will prefer to mix it up with different trailside nutrition, while others may prefer consistency. They do smell quite delicious and have a fairly moist composition immediately after opening the wrapper, which in my opinion feels more natural than other bars I&#8217;ve tried.</p>

<p>The bars have a shelf life of five months from the date of production, which is shorter than most of the other bars out there. To offer a comparison, Larabar has a nine-month shelf life and the <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plan/patagonia-provisions-review/">Patagonia Provision Energy Bars</a> have an eight-month shelf life. Some people claim the ever-popular Cliff bar is still edible after two years, although Cliff does not condone this. The SANS Meal Bars are available as a six-pack for $24, 12-pack for $45, and 24-pack for $79. You can save an additional 10% and get free shipping for subscribing for a delivery every 30 days. Right now, SANS is sending out their two top flavours for free (just cover $3 for shipping / handling) for you to try.

<h4>Wrap Up</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of tossing a bar in my top tube bag before heading out on a long ride, and I usually pack several for a bikepacking trip. Unfortunately, many of the other bars on the market don&#8217;t actually offer that many calories and have lots of filler. Short of making your own, SANS Meal Bars seem to be a better option than most, and their commitment to end world hunger is an added bonus.
