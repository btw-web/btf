<h1>Goodyear Relaunches with a Full Line of Gravel, Touring, and MTB Tires</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how brands get embedded into our memories. When I got this press memo, I was immediately taken back to when I was five years old. As a perk to his job, my father and I got to fly in the Goodyear blimp one sunny fall afternoon in Wisconsin. In what are somewhat hazy memories by this point, I recall being in absolute awe at the sound of the low drone from the blimp&#8217;s internal workings as we magically moved through the sky. Personal associations aside, Goodyear is something of a household name for tires. And although most cyclists likely haven&#8217;t seen the winged, sandle-shod foot logo on a bike tire, the Goodyear name first appeared on a bicycle tire way back in 1898. </p>

<p>Now, 120 years after their original bicycle tires, Goodyear has introduced a new lineup that covers road, gravel, touring, and mountain bikes. According to Goodyear, the line was developed with Rubber Kinetics and utilizes refined compounds and casings that were purpose-built for their intended environments. Available in progressive sizes like &#8220;wide trail,&#8221; Goodyear claims their bicycle tires offer leading-edge performance in traction, wear, rolling efficiency, and puncture resistance.</p>

<p>There are two casing options available throughout the line – Premium and Ultimate – although the actual TPI count hasn&#8217;t been disclosed. There are also several tread compounds, casing protection layer options, and plenty of technical details, all of which are linked at the bottom of the page if you&#8217;d like to learn more. Let&#8217;s take a look at a few highlights from the range:</p>
<h2>Goodyear Mountain Bike Tires</h2>
<p>There are four tires in the MTB range. Here they are in the order in which they&#8217;ve piqued my interest:</p>

<h3>Goodyear Connector and County Gravel Tires</h3>
<p>The Connector is the more aggressive of the two and is touted as Goodyear&#8217;s &#8220;gravel adventuring&#8221; tire. The Connector features a versatile tread pattern with tightly-spaced center knobs combined and aggressive side knobs mated to Goodyear&#8217;s Tubeless Complete construction. According to Goodyear, the result is a fast rolling, high-volume, high-grip, all-terrain tire that&#8217;s ready for everything from backroads to singletrack. The Connector is only available in 700C x 40mm and is priced at $60-$70, depending on the casing. </p>
<p>The Goodyear County is a semi-slick tire with wide spaced side knobs and a smooth center tread to minimize rolling resistance. According to Goodyear, the R:Wall sidewalls and Tubeless Complete construction ensure enhanced durability and fewer flats when the going gets rough. The County is available in 700C x 35mm for $60-$70, depending on the casing.</p>

<h3>Goodyear Transit Tour</h3>
<p>There are two tires in the Transit Range. The Transit Speed, geared more toward urban bikes, and the Transit Tour, a tire that was modeled after Goodyear&#8217;s Assurance All-Season automobile tire. The Transit Tour combines a durable construction with siped directional tread that, according to Goodyear, offers unsurpassed all-weather traction. Reflective side strips enhance night visibility while the S5:Shell under-tread protection and Tubeless Complete system provides robust flat protection and a comfortable ride.</p>
<p><em>The Goodyear Transit Tour is available in 35, 40, and 50mm widths in both 650b and 700C sizes. It&#8217;s priced from $34-$50 depending on the size and casing. <a href="https://www.goodyearbike.com/product-page/transit-tour" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Learn more here</a>.</em></p>
