<h1>Rocky Mountain Toast and the Rackless Rando</h1>
<p>After seeing some cool bag designs on Rocky Mountain Toast&#8217;s Instagram feed, I couldn&#8217;t resist reaching out to learn more about the meaning behind the brand&#8217;s name. The logo clearly depicts an egg on a piece of bread, which I&#8217;ve always called a &#8220;toad in a hole&#8221; (which I&#8217;ve come to learn is a British term I likely picked up from my grandparents), but is also commonly referred to as Rocky Mountain Toast&#8230; in Colorado, at least. Rocky Mountain Toast is a new bag maker based out of Denver, Colorado. Shalom Zohari started the company over a year ago and has since turned what was a hobby into a business. Shalom started sewing at the age of 10 and has had the opportunity to make tents, bags, and clothing over the years—all of which have been thoroughly tested on some epic adventures as well as daily use.  </p>
<p>&#8220;For me, having fun is the most important part of cycling and adventuring.&#8221; Shalom explains. &#8220;As a brand, Rocky Mountain Toast aims to create highly functional products for people who don&#8217;t take themselves too seriously and just wanna have fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rackless Rando is their take on a classic randonneur front bag, but with an interesting twist. It can be mounted on any handlebar without the rack/decaleur system that most rando bags require. As long as your bike has a straight section in the middle of the bars, this bag will work, which means it can be used on anything: a city bike with alt bars, a gravel bike with drop bars, or a shreddy trail bike with flat bars. A recessed portion on the bag wraps around the bar, which—paired with extra-wide velcro straps—gives the bag very good stability even on rough terrain. The two integrated snack/bottle pockets on the back of the bag have one-handed cord locks that are easy to open and close while you ride. If you find that your knees hit standard feed bags when climbing or sprinting, you&#8217;ll be happy to hear that these lower profile pockets eliminate that issue on most bar/stem combinations.</p>

<p>In addition to the large interior pocket, there is a front flap pocket with a drawcord collar, allowing you to really stuff it without worrying about things falling out the sides. Rocky Mountain Toast uses a combination of foam and plastic inserts to keep the bag solid when loaded down or when empty. Despite the bag&#8217;s modest dimensions, Shalom has been able to comfortably fit tools, coffee supplies, a watercolor set, tubes, sealant, snacks, lights, and even a U-lock with no problems. </p>
<p>The Rackless Rando will be available for preorder in 14 different colors of X-Pac and retails for $200 USD. Production of the first order of 10 will be starting this week to be delivered in late January. </p>
