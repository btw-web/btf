<h1>Terrene Announces Cake Eater: With or without studs.</h1>
<p>The Cake Eater features a fast-rolling, low-profile center tread designed for long days on the trail. It is intended to depart from their more aggressive “Wazia” fat tire model that Terrene currently has available in 26&#215;4.0 and 26&#215;4.6. In comparison, the fully studdable Cake Eater has a lighter design, while still offering aggressive side knobs for plenty of cornering power. With their announcement today, Terrene Tires now has eight tires in their lineup and continues to fill interesting and niche roles across the adventure spectrum. </p>

<p>“Inspired by studless winter vehicle snow tires, Cake Eater was designed to have lower center tread height with deep siping for lower rolling resistance and high traction with plenty of biting edges,” said Terrene tire designer Anders Broste. “Stud pockets were added in the transition areas for optional added cornering confidence in icy conditions and side lugs remain tall and edgy for biting into corners.”</p>
<p>In addition to the new tread and stud designs, the Terrene Cake Eater will also be available in a more budget-friendly studded tire option. “We always listen to our dealers, and last year we were constantly praised in helping reduce the MSRP of studded fat bike tires,” said Tim Krueger, General Manager. “They said, thank you for bringing the price down 20% on high-end studded fat bikes tires, but if we can get to $150 for a studded tire, we can reach a new segment of riders that could benefit from studded tires.” This brought about the creation of the standard Cake Eater, using a cost-effective casing, paired with aluminum/tungsten carbide studs with a flat tip that will retail for $150. As with all Terrene tires, it still retains a folding bead and is tubeless ready.</p>
