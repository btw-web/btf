<h1>Second Wind (Film)</h1>
<p><em>Second Wind</em> recounts the story of our first bikepacking trip following the restrictions of the winter lockdown. It was an escape into the wilderness as the pandemic eased its grip and once again presented an opportunity to breathe in the rejuvenating spring air. A return to the mountains&#8230; a dive deep into nature to wash our spirits clean. Watch it below, then scroll down for our thoughts and a full photo gallery.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has unbalanced our lives by depriving us of one of mankind’s most crucial needs: air. The virus not only robs us of the air we breathe, thus affecting our lungs, but it also takes away the air of freedom, forcing us to endure prolonged lockdowns in our attempts to slow its spread. It was winter when the pandemic hit us hardest, with that dreaded sense of suffocation becoming ever more intense, not unlike the feeling of breathlessness as you ascend a steep climb. Occasionally, however, just when it felt like we were about to hit a wall, a new burst of energy suddenly appeared and allowed us to catch our breath, giving us that push we so desperately need to make it through the challenging times. In the sporting world, this is known as the &#8220;second wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our second wind arrived with the spring, the moment when we could breathe again and overcome the climb with renewed strength. Spring marks the rebirth of nature, but it also marks the rebirth of man. It is time for us to return to the wilderness, to ride unbridled in the woods, and light a fire under the cloak of night; to rest in a hammock, spirits soaring free across the very mountains that provide the crucial oxygen that brings us to live and powers ours lungs and minds.</p>

<p>Winter, like the pandemic, left its victims behind – broken trunks and uprooted trees were strewn across the thawing ground. Far up in the mountains, however, the arrival of spring sent a rush of streams and waterfalls that started flowing once again, spreading new life throughout the valleys. At last, we could sit by the riverbank and dip our feet into its cool waters, taking a moment to catch our breath and allowing the mountains to wash our spirits clean.</p>
