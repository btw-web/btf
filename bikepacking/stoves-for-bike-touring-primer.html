<h1>Stoves for Bike Touring: A Primer (part 1)</h1>
<p>When purchasing (or making) a stove for a bike tour, the 3 most important factors to consider are:</p>
<h3>1. Space</h3>
<p>You can never have too much space on a bike tour; especially when you need room for food. For some, having an <a href="/gear/vargo-titanium-hexagon-stove-bikepacking/">ultralight kitchen</a> is a must.</li>
<h3>2. Weight</h3>
<p>This is a no-brainer, although it may be more important to shave grams when planning a bikepacking trip, more so than long-distance touring.</p>
<h3>3. Fuel availability</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty amazing how this can change from country to country. For example, we were able to find white gas (which is lighter and cleaner &#8211; see below for details) in Mexico, but not in other Central American countries. Also, cooking alcohol, spirits, is readily available in east Africa, but not Mongoilia.</p>
<p>There are basically 3 types of stoves that folks ultimately decide to bring on a bike tour:</p>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Multi-fuel Stoves:</strong> The most popular are pressurized multi-fuel stoves which burn white gas, gasoline, and other types of fuel;</li>
<li><strong>Spirit burner Stoves:</strong> Spirit burners, such as the Trangia, or a DIY can stove, can burn methyl alcohol, medical alcohol, booze, and other spirits;</li>
<li><strong>Wood-burning Stoves:</strong> Wood burning stoves are especially good when traveling in a remote location over long distance in a dry climate.</li>
<li><strong>Canister Stoves:</strong> These are not nearly as versatile as pressurized canisters (butane/propane) aren&#8217;t always available.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many stoves that can be purchased (usually $20-200) as well as several designs that are fairly easy to DIY. In this post I will explore the pros and cons of four preferred stoves that can be purchased. In part two I will build several DIY stoves and test each for fuel consumption, time-to-boil and weight.</p>

<h2>MSR Whisperlite International</h2>
<p>The Whisperlite is the probably the most popular multi-fuel stove on the market, and the simplest. Like other multi-fuel options, it requires a few parts and pieces to operate and maintain: a windscreen, spare parts kit, pump and specific type of fuel bottle. </p>
<ul class="gearlist">
<li>Cost: <span>$99 (approximately).</span></li>
<li>Fuel: <span>Burns White gas, kerosene and unleaded gasoline.</span></li>
<li>Speed: <span>Boils one liter of water in about 3 1/2 minutes using white gas.</span></li>
<li>Packed Weight: <span>417 grams (Stove, pump, stuff sack, windscreen, maintenance kit).</span></li>
<li>Packed dimensions: <span>approximately 7&#8243; x 6&#8243; x 3.5&#8243;.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>PROS</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Fuel options</strong> makes it a go-anywhere stove.</li>
<li><strong>Boils water fast.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lightest and smallest</strong> of the three pressurized options outlined in this post.</li>
<li><strong>Easy</strong> to maintain</li>
<li><strong>White gas</strong> (if you can get it) has light-weight properties: 1 oz (by volume) weighs approx. .8 oz.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CONS</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>It&#8217;s fairly difficult</strong> to get a good simmer with this stove, although veteran advocates of the Whisperlite will claim otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>White gas is hard to come by</strong> and like other multi fuel stoves, it can be dirty and smelly when using gasoline.</li>
<li><strong>Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t burn quite right</strong> when using poor quality unleaded fuel.</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/13-07-20_02.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/13-07-20_02-740x491.jpg" alt="Bike Touring Stove - MSR Whisperlite" width="740" height="491" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1831 no-caption" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/13-07-20_02-740x491.jpg 740w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/13-07-20_02-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/13-07-20_02.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></a>
<h3>THINGS TO THINK ABOUT</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>What kind of fuel</strong> can I get where I will be touring?</li>
<li><strong>Am I culinarily-inspired</strong> and in need of a finely tuned simmer? If so, it may not be your stove.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TIPS</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li>In Mexico and some of Guatemala you can find Gasolina Blanca (white gas) in Comex paint stores.</li>
</ul>
<h3>NOTES</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li>The Whisperlite Universal comes with attachment to use canister fuel (which I did see in several Central American countries) and it simmers when burning canister fuel &#8211; $139.</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/13-07-20_03.jpg" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/13-07-20_03-740x491.jpg" alt="Bike Touring Stove - Primus Omnifuel" width="740" height="491" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1832 no-caption" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/13-07-20_03-740x491.jpg 740w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/13-07-20_03-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/13-07-20_03.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></a>
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
<h2>Primus Omnifuel</h2>
<p><a href="http://twoscoopsless.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Lee</a>, my touring comrade through Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama used the Primus Omnifuel. And because it was superior for simmering, we used it to make our nightly one-pot wonders. I usually made coffee in the AM with the Whisperlite. The Primus is a little more expensive than other stoves, but it certainly stands out in performance.</p>
<ul class="gearlist">
<li>Cost: <span>$182 (approximately).</li>
<li>Fuel: <span>White gas, kerosene, diesel, unleaded gasoline, butane, aviation fuel, etc.</span></li>
<li>Speed: <span>Boils one liter of water in about 3 1/2 minutes.</span></li>
<li>Weight: <span>530 grams (Stove, pump, stuff sack, windscreen, maintenance kit) &#8211; set up for liquid fuel.</span></li>
<li>Packed dimensions: <span>approximately 8&#8243; x 8&#8243; x 3&#8243;, but it can be packed smaller.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>PROS</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Very good at simmering</strong> with liquid fuel.</li>
<li><strong>The pump</strong> of the Primus has metal parts and is more convincingly constructed.</li>
<li><strong>The Primus doesn&#8217;t seem as finicky</strong> as the MSR offerings.</li>
<li><strong>The flip flop bottle</strong> design allows you bleed out the remaining pressure and burn out the line&#8230; the stove is much cleaner and less sooty because of this and smells less of gasoline.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CONS</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li>Expensive.</li>
<li><strong>A bit loud</strong> (not nearly as loud as the Dragonfly, but definitely louder than the Whisperlite).</li>
<li><strong>Heavier</strong> than the Whisperlite.</li>
</ul>
<h3>THINGS TO THINK ABOUT</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>If you really love cooking</strong>, the Primus is great for longer tours.</li>
<li><strong>The Primus stays much cleaner</strong> because of the line-bleed option. So if cleanliness is your thing, this may be your stove.</li>
</ul>
<h3>NOTES</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li>Primus now has a titanium version which is slightly lighter if you have the extra dough.</li>
</ul>

<div class="post-spacer"></div>
<h2>MSR Dragonfly</h2>
<p>The MSR Dragonfly is somewhat similar to the Primus, although it&#8217;s MUCH louder. Mike used the Dragonfly on our tour and I had a hard time with this stove because of its loudness. Basically it was so loud, it made it difficult to have a conversation as dinner was being prepared. However, a lot of folks like this stove for it&#8217;s weight, size and simmer capabilities.</p>
<ul class="gearlist">
<li>Cost: <span>$140 (approximately).</span></li>
<li>Fuel: <span>White gas, kerosene, diesel, unleaded, etc.</span></li>
<li>Weight: <span>510 grams (Stove, pump, stuff sack, windscreen, maintenance kit).</span></li>
<li>Speed: <span>Boils one liter of water in about 3 1/2 minutes using white gas.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>PROS</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Has a more stable platform</strong> than the Whisperlite for pots and pans.</li>
<li><strong>Boils a cup of water</strong> in about 1.5 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>THINGS TO THINK ABOUT</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>Will you be &#8216;stealth camping&#8217;?</strong> If so, the loudness of this thing may give you away.</li>
<li>Do you like to have intimate conversations over the camp hearth during dinner prep?</li>
</ul>

<div class="post-spacer"></div>
<h2>Trangia spirit burner</h2>
<p>I ran across a couple folks that seemed to have pretty good luck finding medical grade alcohol throughout Central America to burn in their Trangia. Having been intrigued by this method of cooking, I recently bought a Trangia took it on an overnight <a href="/plog/an-impromptu-overnight-in-pisgah/" title="bikepacking blog post">bikepacking trip</a>.</p>
<ul class="gearlist">
<li>Cost: <span>$15 (approximately) / $25 (approximately).</span></li>
<li>Fuel: <span>Heet, methanol (methyl hydrate in Canada), denatured alcohol, Everclear, among other sprits.</span></li>
<li>Speed: <span>Boils one liter of water in about 10 minutes; Burned 40ml alcohol in 9.5 minutes.</span></li>
<li>Weight: <span>111 grams / 186 grams with Esbit windscreen.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>PROS</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li><strong>You can carry fuel</strong> in any plastic bottle.</li>
<li><strong>Burns without any noise</strong> whatsoever.</li>
<li><strong>Extremely cheap</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Ridiculously small</strong> and light.</li>
<li><strong>Fuel is cheaper</strong> than gasoline and petrol.</li>
<li><strong>Simmering</strong> is completely doable with the included simmer ring.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CONS</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li>It is very slow to boil water.</li>
</ul>
<h3>THINGS TO THINK ABOUT</h3>
<ul class="arrow-list v2">
<li>If you prefer peace and quiet, and you are not in a hurry, this may be your stove.</li>
<li>Trangia also offers a multitude of cookware configurations with built in stand, windscreen, etc.</li>
</ul>
