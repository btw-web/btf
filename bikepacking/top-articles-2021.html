<h1>Our 12 Most Popular Articles of 2021</h1>
<p>This year at BIKEPACKING.com saw another record number of posts, with our small team working independently and with folks from across the bikepacking community to share around 1,250 original articles, reviews, routes, dispatches, and more. We&#8217;re quite proud of that number, as well as the broad range of topics we touched on in 2021, and that total doesn&#8217;t even include the essays and stories we published offline in <em>The Bikepacking Journal</em> or the countless events we listed in our bikepacking events calendar. It was a big year for bikepacking, with more people than ever before heading out to try riding and camping, and we&#8217;re incredibly grateful to be able to inspire and inform so many people.</p>
<p>As always, we want to thank our readers for all of the comments, clicks, shares, and feedback on all of our posts this year. And we owe a special thanks to our <strong><a href="/join">Bikepacking Collective</a></strong> members who make all of our work possible here on the site, on YouTube, and in print.

<h2><a href="/index/">1. Gear Indexes</a></h2>
<p>For the third year running, our Gear Indexes were again our most click-inducing posts of the year, taking a handful of top spots. First launched back in 2019, The Gear Index is our series of comprehensive reference and comparison lists for various types of popular bikepacking, cycling, and camping gear. Our growing list of Gear Indexes is always a work in progress, so check back for updates. Even better, please use the comments below to let us know what types of bikes and gear you’d like to see in Gear Indexes in 2022!</p>

<h2><a href="/gear/best-flat-pedal-mountain-bike-shoes-2021/">2. Best Flat Pedal Shoes</a></h2>
<p>Flat shoes or SPDs? It’s an age-old debate in the cycling world. In his search for the best flat pedal shoes on the market, Logan tested seven pairs that are relatively accessible and compared them based on comfort, looks, durability, and one of the most important factors, pedal grip.

<h2><a href="/plog/iohan-gueorguiev-1988-2021/">3. Remembering Iohan Gueorguiev</a></h2>
<p>Undoubtedly one of the most inspiring and enthusiastic bikepackers of all time, we paid tribute to Iohan Gueorguiev, better known as the Bike Wanderer, following his death this August. Our ode to one of the greats included the first episode of Iohan&#8217;s extraordinary &#8220;See the World&#8221; video series from 2014 and a handful of our favorites photos of him taken during his journey down the length of the Americas. Rest in peace, Iohan. See the post <a href="/plog/iohan-gueorguiev-1988-2021/">here</a>, and look for a heartfelt remembrance of him in the seventh issue of <em>The Bikepacking Journal</em>.</p>

<h2><a href="/bikes/bikepacking-race-rigs/">4. Bikepacking Race Rigs</a></h2>
<p>We love scoping out race rigs and nerding out over how folks have set their bikes up for particular events, and it&#8217;s clear you do too. Again this year, our “Rigs of” roundups were among the most popular articles on the site. And despite the race calendar not being quite as full as usual due to COVID-19, we were still able to put together a handful of “Rigs of” posts from races around the world. </p>

<h2><a href="/bikes/kona-sutra-ultd-review/">5. Kona Sutra ULTD Review</a></h2>
<p>The Kona Sutra ULTD “UnLimTeD” is a bike that aims to blur boundaries and tackle any terrain. After six months riding singletrack, bikepacking, and gravelling the ULTD all around the southern Appalachians, Logan picked this beast apart and compared it to its older sibling, the venerable Sutra LTD.

<h2><a href="/gear/surly-corner-bar-review/">6. Surly Corner Bar Review</a></h2>
<p>The Corner Bar from Surly briefly took the bikepacking world by storm when it was released. Conceived to easily convert a mountain bike to drops, this interesting (some might say weird) handlebar functions like a drop bar but works with mountain shifters and brake levers. We had the chance to test one before launch, and folks were <em>very</em> interested to learn about it. Find the full review <a href="/gear/surly-corner-bar-review/">here</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="/routes/european-divide-trail/">7. European Divide Trail</a></h2>
<p>Andy Cox&#8217;s European Divide Trail, which traverses the continent from the shores of the Arctic Ocean in Norway to the wild Atlantic coastline of southwestern Portugal, was the most viewed route of the year. It&#8217;s no surprise to see it take the top spot given the ambition behind it and the fact that it traverses nine countries and countless dirt roads, singletrack trails, quiet lanes, and traffic-free byways. Once it&#8217;s refined, we&#8217;re expecting some variation of it to become a classic bikepacking route. Find the full route guide <a href="/routes/european-divide-trail/">here</a>. </p>

<h2><a href="/bikes/decathlon-riverside-touring-920-review/">8. Decathlon Riverside Touring 920 Review</a></h2>
<p>With a well-rounded build kit, a dynamo hub, and all the mounting points you could ever need, the Decathlon Riverside Touring 920 is purpose-built for the long haul, and its $1,800 price tag made readers around the world extremely curious to know how it held up to real-world testing. We were too, so Miles put one through its paces in British Columbia. Read his review <a href="/bikes/decathlon-riverside-touring-920-review/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The third and final bike review taking home a spot on our most popular posts of 2021 list is the Canyon Grizl, a drop-bar gravel bike with clearance for 700 x 50mm tires, lots of mounting points, and features that cater to long days in the saddle.

<h2><a href="/gear/ratio-1x12-upgrade-kit-review/">12. Ratio 1×12 Wide Upgrade Kit Review</a></h2>
<p>Sneaking in at the 12th spot is the Ratio 1×12 Wide Upgrade Kit, which allows you to easily hack an 11-speed SRAM road shifter to work with a 12-speed Eagle MTB derailleur. We installed and tested one with a well-used Rival 1 mechanical shifter and an equally worn Eagle X01 derailleur and cassette. Find details and our review <a href="/gear/ratio-1x12-upgrade-kit-review/">here</a>.</p>
