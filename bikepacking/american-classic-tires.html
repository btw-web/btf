<h1>American Classic Launches Eight New Tire Models</h1>
<p>Three years after closing its doors, American Classic is back and has re-entered the cycling market with a diverse line of eight fresh tire models. The range includes five gravel, one city/touring, and two road tires, nearly all of which are available in two colors and a variety of sizes. Nearly all tires are tubless-ready, and all are manufactured in-house and priced in the $30 to $35 range. For now, they&#8217;re only available in the United States via a direct-to-consumer model through Amazon and the American Classic website. Everything in the new line-up includes a two-year warranty against manufacturing defects, and is also covered under their Road Hazard Replacement Policy, which provides customers with a one-time discount of 50% on a replacement tire, should theirs puncture or tear while riding.</p>

<p>Of particular interest is the new American Classic gravel tire collection, which features designs that span from center-slick for hardpacked gravel and mixed terrain to full-on knobby for riding gnarlier tracks and trails. The entire range of models includes American Classic&#8217;s Rubberforce G tire compound and Stage 5S Flat Protection, and the brand says they&#8217;re built to &#8220;surpass the demands of today&#8217;s gravel riders.&#8221; Find overviews of all five new gravel models below (provided by American Classic), as well as the new city/touring tire, which may be interesting for some readers riding more pavement-heavy routes.</p>

<h2>American Classic Kimberlite</h2>
<p>Thanks to the perfect balance of volume and a fast-rolling tread, the Kimberlite is the go-anywhere tire that rides like a road tire on the pavement and hooks up on the dirt roads and hardpack singletrack you’re relentlessly seeking. A continuous center section rolls smoothly with minimal resistance, while strong side knobs let you lean into dirt corners. A tubeless-ready 120 TPI casing and three-layer Stage 5S flat protection provide a responsive handling tire that staves off most punctures to keep you rolling.</p>

Our Stage 5S flat protection and a tubeless-ready 120 TPI casing will keep you rolling through the harshest conditions.</p>
