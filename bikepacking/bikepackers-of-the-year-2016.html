<h1>2016 Bikepacking Awards: People and Routes</h1>
<p>In parts one and two of our 2016 Bikepacking Awards, we showcased our <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/bikepacking-videos-photos-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Bikepacking Video/Photography/Art</a> and <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/2016-bikepacking-gear-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gear of The Year</a>. </p>
<p>For our final Awards installment, it seems only fitting that we celebrate the <em>people</em> who have contributed most to our community, whether through their physical achievements, the richness of their storytelling, or their commitment to bikepacking advocacy.  Additionally, we both acknowledge and thank Bikepacking.com&#8217;s contributors for crafting our favorite new bikepacking routes of 2016; from small but perfectly formed weekend escapes that help us keep us sane, to overseas odysseys that stoke our desires to explore the world on two wheels. </p>
<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Bikepacker of The Year</h2>
<p><em>Our top award goes to an individual who has not only impressed us with the range and variety of his or her two-wheel explorations and achievements throughout 2016, but who has also made a significant positive impact on the bikepacking community as a whole.</em></p>

<h3>Lael Wilcox</h3>
<p>In addition to several exploratory rides &#8211; including scouting and designing the <a href="/routes/baja-divide/">Baja Divide</a> from December 2015-March 2016 &#8211; Lael left Alaska on May 1 to ride down to Astoria, OR, for the start of the Trans Am Bike Race. Ultimately Lael completed this mammoth journey in a mere 18 days and 10 minutes, becoming the first American to win the 4,400 mile self supported ultra-endurance road race. In 2016, Lael and partner-in-crime Nicholas Carman cycled up the East Coast, completed a short Montana tour to Missoula &#8211; where Lael spoke at ACA’s Montana Bicycle Celebration &#8211; rode a chunk of the Colorado Trail and assorted routes between Denver and Grand Junction, held several bikepacking workshops at Interbike, and became the first thru-riders on the new Reno-Vegas route. Hopping back to Alaska, the pair then held an event donating 35 bicycles to 3rd graders at Russian Jack Elementary school, a Title I school. There&#8217;s also the plethora of workshops and talks Lael has given throughout the year on the Baja Divide, as well as the insightful thoughts she shared in the inspiring <a href="https://bikepacking.com/plog/fast-forward-film-lael-wilcox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Forward</a> short film. Last but not least, Lael created and awarded “Lael’s Globe of Adventure Women’s Scholarship for the Baja Divide”, a first of its kind bikepacking scholarship, available to one female rider tackling the Baja Divide route in the 2016-2017 season. Follow Lael on Instagram <a href="http://www.instagram.com/laelwilcox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@laelwilcox</a>.</p>
<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Explorers of the Year</h2>
<p><em>This award is dedicated to the intrepid few who’ve set out to experience the furthest corners of the backcountry, both across the globe and close to home, and thoughtfully shared their stories with the rest of us.</em></p>

<h3>Montanus, The Wild Side</h3>
<p>Giorgio Frattale and Francesco D’Alessio are two old friends and wilderness and bicycle enthusiasts. In 2013 they conceived Montanus (from Montane in classical Latin), an all-seasons bikepacking project, based in Abruzzo, the Italian region where the mountain chain Gran Sasso d’Italia shows its majesty. In 2016, their route creation skills shone bright as the tackled and documented rides from the unique <a href="/routes/swamp-thing-trail-estonia/">Swamp Thing Trail</a> in Estonia, to the quad crushing <a href="/routes/tour-du-mont-blanc/">Tour Du Mont Blanc</a>. And in between they developed the <a href="/routes/bikepacking-abruzzo/">Wolf’s Lair</a> and rode several classic routes like the Kokopelli trail and the White Rim.

<h4>Przemek and Saska</h4>
<p> Saška Aleksandra Bellian and Przemek Duszynski have a solid history of bikepacking adventures. This year saw them took off on a multi-leg journey, capturing photos along the way that both inspired and filled us with envy. Back in May, they left their home in Poland to cycled several routes in Scotland, before completing a loop in Iceland. Their adventures continued when they caught a flight to North America and cycled most of the Great Divide, the Colorado Trail, Kokopelli, and the Baja Divide. Follow their travels at <a href="http://inbetweenspokes.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inbetweenspokes.wordpress.com</a>. <em>Photo by Tales on Tyres.</em></div>

<h4>Ben Page</h4>
<p>22-year-old Ben Page has been documenting his solo, self-financed Round the World bike ride through a series of beautifully crafted and deeply personal <a href="http://www.anotherhorizon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short films</a>. What began a traditional bike tour has morphed into a fat bike adventure, marked by Ben&#8217;s epic winter ride across Canada’s frozen north to the Arctic sea, where he pitted himself against unexpected storms and frigid, -22f temperatures. Since then, Ben’s knocked out China to Turkey on his Fatback, and is now readying himself for the rigors of Africa. There, he hopes to put fat tires to good use with a challenging traverse of the Saharan desert. </div>

<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Ambassadors of the Year</h2>
<p><em>The award for individuals who have helped propel bikepacking to the forefront of the outdoor community and beyond.</em></p>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/scott-morris.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27997" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/scott-morris-1200x800.jpg" alt="Scott Morris" width="1200" height="800" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-27997" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/scott-morris-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/scott-morris-233x155.jpg 233w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/scott-morris-740x494.jpg 740w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/scott-morris-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/scott-morris.jpg 1480w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a>
<h3>Scott Morris</h3>
<p>Scott Morris has been strongly influential in the bikepacking community for well over a decade and is long overdue for recognition &#8211; so we figured 2016 should be the year. Back in the mid-2000’s, Scott started bikepacking.net, bringing the concept of bikepacking to a wider audience during the very youngest days of the sport. Along with Lee Blackwell, he pioneered the first AZT-by-bike passage in 2005, that included hiking through the Grand Canyon with bikes on their backs. Scott has also been on the frontlines of route mapping with the development of Topofusion, a route planning software, and Trackleaders; the latter has propelled bikepacking ultra racing culture as much as any other utility or publication. In addition, Scott is the godfather of the Arizona Trail Race and has managed it since its inception. He volunteers time to trail building and the AZT Association, and has designed and advocated for countless other routes including the <a href="/routes/arizona-bikepacking-gila-river-ramble/">Gila River Ramble</a>, one of our personal favorites. In 2014, he and his partner Eszter Horyani undertook the colossal challenge of through-riding the CDT and more recently, Scott created the Hot Sisters Hot Springs route in Oregon &#8211; a route we look forward to learning more about, once the two of them are finished bike-tramping through New Zealand&#8230; Follow Scott on Instagram <a href="http://www.instagram.com/topofusionscott" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@topofusionscott</a></p>

<h4>Emily Chappell &#038; Lee Craigie</h4>
<p> Throughout 2016, Emily and Lee have devoted much of their time to encouraging other women and girls to follow in their tire treads &#8211; while still finding the energy to undertake several self-supported, beefy bikepacking trips (The Transcontinental Bike Race, The Highland Trail 550, the Transpyrenees and the Bearbones 200). This year&#8217;s main achievement revolves around The Adventure Syndicate, a collective drawn from a team of skilled communicators and experienced bike riders, primed with a mission to deliver female-specific bikepacking courses, talks, workshops, conference appearances, and Women and Bike events across the UK. In January 2017, The Adventure Syndicate will produce its first printed publication, with the aim of inspiring, encouraging and enabling more people &#8211; especially women, girls and those in isolated communities &#8211; to realise the challenges they are capable of.

<h4>Bjørn Olsen &#038; Kim McNett</h4>
<p> Bjørn Olson, an Alaskan Adventurer, and Kim McNett, a lifelong naturalist, are bonded by their wilderness pursuits. Bjorn and Kim have covered a lot of ground on foot and in boats, and challenged more remote Alaskan backcountry on bikes than almost anyone. They’ve developed a lot of specific skills to this kind of travel that only a few other people share. Their travels form a network of highlighted lines across the map of Alaska. Both are active contributors to Ground Truth Trekking, an Alaskan nonprofit which educates and engages on Alaska&#8217;s natural resource issues through wilderness adventure and scientific analysis. This year Bjorn and Kim released <a href="http://salsacycles.com/stories/ring_of_fire">Ring of Fire, a Salsa Storysite</a> that is compelling in every right and is a shining example of how they live and their ideals.</div>

<h2 class="clip" style="font-style:italic;">Ultra-achievers of the Year</h2>
<p><em>The award for individuals who aim to compete and progress ultra-endurance bikepacking as a competitive sport and a personal challenge.</em></p>
<a href="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/neil-beltchenko.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27996" class="media-img" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/neil-beltchenko-1200x800.jpg" alt="Neil Beltchenko" width="1200" height="800" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-27996" srcset="https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/neil-beltchenko-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/neil-beltchenko-233x155.jpg 233w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/neil-beltchenko-740x494.jpg 740w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/neil-beltchenko-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikepacking.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/neil-beltchenko.jpg 1480w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a>
<h3>Neil Beltchenko</h3>
<p>Neil had many top finishes in 2016, the most notable being that he took down Kurt Refsnider’s 2010 AZT750 record — one of the oldest records in ultra-bikepacking — by finishing the race in 6 days, 12 hours and 28 minutes. Before that, Neil finished first in JP’s Fat Pursuit, a rugged winter ultra. Neil also set a new course record on an ITT of the Colorado Trail (3d 19h 50m), after we assumed Jesse Jakomait’s remarkable showing last year would stand for while. Last but not least, Neil also recorded the fastest time on the Comstock Epic route, not a highly contested route but a stellar time nonetheless. 2016 was indeed Neil Beltchenko’s year, and perhaps the first of many.

<h4>Mike Hall</h4>
<p> Just when we thought Josh Kato’s 2015 record would stick for a minute, Mike Hall, of Yorkshire, England, came along and shattered it by over a half a day. Mike led the 2016 race from the beginning, finished on June 24th and now holds the new Tour Divide Record with an unofficial time of 13 days 22 hours and 51 minutes. The former time held by Josh Kato was 14 days, 11 hours and 37 minutes. <a href="http://www.instagram.com/couldntgetmike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@couldntgetmike</a></div>

<h4>Markus Stitz</h4>
<p>From September 2015 to August 2016, Markus Stitz completed an around the world bike journey covering 34,097 kilometers through 26 countries… all on a singlespeed bike. While not the first to complete this feat on a one gear bike, Markus is the first to do it on a singlespeed mountain bike with a bikepacking setup&#8230; and went over the Guinness benchmark by more than 5,000 kilometers. <a href="http://www.instagram.com/reizkultur/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@reizkultur</a></div>

<h3>The Baja Divide</h3>
<p>Originally planned and scouted between December 2016-March 2016 by Nicholas Carman and Lael Wilcox, the Baja Divide has been almost a year in development. The 1700 mile (2734km) route connects northern Mexico Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Cortez, linking historic Spanish mission sites, remote ranchos and fishing villages, bustling highway towns, and every major mountain range in Baja California &#8211; via mile upon mile of beautiful, backcountry desert tracks. What’s more, Baja Divide comes complete with an in-depth supporting website packed with route notes, bike setup details and cultural insights, making it especially appealing to US riders looking to experience the challenges and rewards of a first-time bikepack abroad.

<h4>Trans-Ecuador (TEMBR)</h4>
<p> The Trans Ecuador Mountain Bike Route runs the length of the country&#8217;s volcanic corridor, following singletrack, jeep tracks, unpaved roads, and tertiary, low traffic sealed roads where possible. It’s available in two flavours &#8211; an intense <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/trans-ecuador-singletrack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singletrack and Hike-a-Bike version</a> that was published in November, along with a more mellow Dirt Road alternative that we’ll be posting in January. Either way, it’s a beautiful, 25 day, 760 mile (1223km) traverse across rugged Andean countryside, connecting vibrant, colorful market towns with the small mountain settlements that dot the crumpled highlands and ethereal páramo. TEMBR Singletrack was concocted by the Dammer Brothers, Ecuadorian climbing and bikepacking legends, while devising TEMBR Dirt has been a collaborative effort between Cass Gilbert and the Dammers, with valuable additional support by <a href="http://nicholasgault.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicholas Gault</a>.</div>

<h4>Altravesur</h4>
<p>Scouted and documented by Logan Watts and Virginia Krabill in the winter of 2015/2016. This 834 mile (1,342km) route was created in a relatively free-form fashion by studying historic tracks, talking with plenty of local mountain bikers, and connecting some of the best dirt tracks in southern Spain. With the epic GR7 as its backbone, the Altravesur crosses southern Spain from Cadiz in the west to Valencia on the Mediterranean coast. This challenging bikepacking route flows through countless mountain ranges and parks, incorporating portions of the TransAndalus and TransNevada cycling circuits, the GR249, GR243, GR247, and GR66 footpaths, the Via Verde de la Sierra Alcaraz, and the Ruta de Don Quixote.

<h4>Green Mountain Gravel Growler</h4>
<p> The seed for the Green Mountain Gravel Growler was planted back in 2013, after a visit to Vermont revealed a burgeoning craft brewery scene that churned out 10 of the top 50 beers in the United States. Three years later Joe Cruz and Logan Watts set out to make the idea reality. The end result is a 250 mile loop weaving a selection of storybook-farm dirt roads, flowy New England singletrack, and rugged historic woodland paths to create a circuit of some of the world’s best and most coveted craft beers.

Described as a bikepacking, touring or randonneur event, it’s a non-timed, 700km journey across the high cols and stradas of southern Europe. The scenery looks absolutely spectacular and with a variety of gpx alternatives to choose from &#8211; depending on your setup, your interests and the energy in your legs &#8211; it promises a refreshing format too, by allowing riders of different paces to overlap throughout the route. </div>

<h4>Hunt Snowy Mountains 1000</h4>
<p> The inaugural <a href="http://huntbikes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hunt Snowy Mountains 1000</a> has recently come to an end. Running from Canberra to Melbourne this 1000km, self-supported, mostly off road route courses its way through the rugged terrain of Australian Alps.  As the organisers point out, “This is not intended to be a three hours of sleep per night,  kill yourself, race to the finish line. It is however intended to be an enjoyable challenge against yourself.” There’s even an option to leave a few days earlier, if you plan on riding at a more comfortable pace, so everyone can meet at the end for a celebratory dinner and beers. </div>
