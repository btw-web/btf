<h1>Travel Insurance for Cycle Tourists in the Time of COVID-19</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At TDA Global Cycling we organize bicycle tours through more than 80 countries and have participants from around the world. From our experience, we know there isn&#8217;t one travel insurance product that fits every tour, every nationality, or every participant; especially during a pandemic.</p>
<p>To learn more about the process of buying travel insurance, you can read our <a href="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/2020/10/travel-insurance-for-cyclists-everything-you-need-to-know/">detailed travel insurance advice here</a> but in this blog post we are focusing on what you need to know about insurance during COVID-19.</p>
<h3>COVID-19 Travel Insurance</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="205" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-47263" src="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AW9I2308-300x205.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AW9I2308-300x205.jpg 300w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AW9I2308-600x409.jpg 600w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AW9I2308-768x524.jpg 768w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AW9I2308-1536x1048.jpg 1536w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AW9I2308-2048x1397.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The good news is that compared to the early days of the pandemic, finding travel insurance that includes coverage for possible COVID-19 medical or quarantine costs has become easier. For most nationalities, though not all, there are multiple travel insurance options to choose from.</p>
<p>While the current marketplace for travel insurance in relation to COVID-19 remains fluid, it is becoming clear that many insurance companies have realized selling travel insurance covering COVID-19 is a profitable venture. For this reason, travel insurance covering COVID-19 medical and quarantine costs is likely here to stay, but as the saying goes, ‘it’s all in the details’, the policy details in this case.</p>
<p>A few key details to check when purchasing travel insurance are…</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the insurance cover COVID-19 medical costs?</li>
<li>Does the insurance apply to your age group and your nationality?</li>
<li>Do you need to be fully vaccinated to be covered?</li>
<li>Does the insurance cover COVID-19 medical costs in the countries that you are travelling to? Depending on the policy, this may be affected by your respective government’s travel advice for those countries.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Travel Interruption and Cancellation Insurance for COVID-19</h3>
<p>It is always important to read the policy to be sure it fits your needs before purchasing. In addition to the travel insurance covering COVID-19 medical and quarantine costs, does the policy include trip cancellation and/or trip interruption insurance? (You can read more about what these are in our general travel insurance blog – <em><a href="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/2020/10/travel-insurance-for-cyclists-everything-you-need-to-know/">Travel Insurance for Cyclists – Everything You Need to Know</a>.</em>)</p>
<p>At this time, we have not seen cancellation insurance that covers you if you decide not to travel, or if it becomes impossible to travel due to a worsening COVID-19 situation at your destination. However, cancellation coverage does now exist in the event that you were to contract COVID-19 before your departure and not be able to travel for that reason. There are also some plans that appear to have trip interruption coverage – this is insurance covering the non-medical costs of ending your trip prematurely due to COVID-19 – but there are caveats and exceptions, so we can’t stress enough the importance of reading your policy carefully.</p>
