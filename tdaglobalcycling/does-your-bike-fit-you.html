<p>The first time I bought a bike to use on a tour, I had a few things on my mind for selecting the right one. First, get something in my price range, then do the stand over test to ensure it&#8217;s the right size and, lastly, make sure I could put a rack on the back. After all, what else could I need? After my first big ride I quickly realized there were a few issues. My hands started going numb after about an hour, then I noticed a pinching feeling in my back. I was worried. Did I choose the wrong bike? I decided to do some research and booked an appointment at my local bike shop for a bike fit.</p>
<p>The whole experience took about two hours and I was able to fix the issues with some adjustments, switching out a few parts and installing a new saddle based on my measurements. After going out for a few longer rides to test out the changes, I couldn&#8217;t believe the difference. I had no more unusual pains and the bike felt great! A proper bike fit should improve your overall comfort, help to prevent repetitive stress injuries and reduce or eliminate back, knee, neck and wrist pain. The person doing the fit has been trained to measure everything and watch your form while riding on a stationary trainer. They will ask you questions so be sure to tell them of any and all concerns or past injuries you&#8217;ve had. Some simple adjustments that can make a huge improvement in your comfort level are your <a href="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/2020/05/2-minute-tips-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">footwear</a>, saddle, reach and handlebar angle.</p>

<p>If you are unsure if your bike fits you properly or if you have any issues I highly suggest you get a bike fit done. Your best bet is to ask your local bike shop if they offer this service. If not, they should have somewhere they can recommend.</p>
<p>Whether you already have a bike you love or you&#8217;re shopping around for a new touring machine, it&#8217;s important to ensure it fits you perfectly. If you have done touring on your bike and have had no issues, then you can most likely skip the bike fit!</p>
