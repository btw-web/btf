<h3><a id="1" style="padding-top: 100px; margin-top: -100px;"></a>1. Tour Finder and Calendar Tools</h3>
<p>The best place to start is using our <a href="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/tour-finder/">Tour Finder</a> or Calendar tools. If dates or time of the year are the biggest limiting factor for you, start with the <a href="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/tour-finder/calendar/">Calendar</a>. We usually have tours listed for the current year and for 2-3 years into the future. When you see one that overlaps the time of year you are available for, click on it to read the detailed tour information. You can also use the previous and next arrows to flip between different years. Note that not every tour runs every year. Most, in fact, run every second year.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45299 size-full" src="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Calendar.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="970" srcset="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Calendar.jpg 1700w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Calendar-300x171.jpg 300w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Calendar-768x438.jpg 768w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Calendar-600x342.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px" /></p>
<p>If date isn&#8217;t the key factor, then start with Tour Finder. This allows you to filter the tour options by continent, type of tour, difficulty, duration, type of accommodation, and more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45298 size-full" src="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TourFinder.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="970" srcset="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TourFinder.jpg 1700w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TourFinder-300x171.jpg 300w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TourFinder-768x438.jpg 768w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TourFinder-600x342.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px" /></p>
<p>As you choose the filter options, the results will update automatically. The main tour will always appear. Below each main tour, you will see accompanying boxes showing the details of the shorter parts (the &#8216;sections&#8217; &#8211; more on that later). You can SHOW or HIDE the section details as you wish.</p>
<p>Once you have narrowed down your search, you can see a bit of detail about each tour option. When you see one that appeals to you, click on its photo or title, and it will take you to the page with the complete tour details.</p>
<h3><a id="2" style="padding-top: 100px; margin-top: -100px;"></a>2. Tour Types and Joining Sections</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45300 size-full" src="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adventure.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="970" srcset="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adventure.jpg 1700w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adventure-300x171.jpg 300w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adventure-768x438.jpg 768w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adventure-600x342.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px" /></p>
<p>Another way to choose a tour is to consider the type of tour &#8211; Touring, Adventure, or Expedition. You can start with any of these types, but those in the <a href="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/touring/">Touring</a> category tend to be fewer kilometers per day and give you access to more creature comforts. <a href="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/adventure/">Adventure</a> tours are, as you might imagine, a little more adventurous and challenging, and located in some more far-out and unique cycling destinations. <a href="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/expedition/">Expedition</a> tours are typically our longest and most challenging tours, often in more remote far off places.</p>
<h4>Joining Part of a Longer Tour</h4>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t have time to do a multi-month cycling tour all at once. So many people choose &#8216;sections&#8217; of these tours. All of our long cycling adventures are broken into shorter pieces that we call sections. So if you have two weeks available, and you want to join our three month long Bamboo Road tour in SE Asia, no problem. We plan the route so that section riders can meet up with us at major cities along the route.</p>
<p>Section riders should arrive a full day or two before their section begins to give time to get briefed by the tour leader and for the mechanics to help you reassemble your bike. <a href="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/tour-sections/">Read more about our sections here</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="3" style="padding-top: 100px; margin-top: -100px;"></a>3. Detailed Tour Information</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-45301 size-full" src="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TourDetails.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="970" srcset="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TourDetails.jpg 1700w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TourDetails-300x171.jpg 300w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TourDetails-768x438.jpg 768w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TourDetails-600x342.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px" /></p>
<p>Now that you have chosen a tour (or a section of a tour) you will find yourself on a page like this above. This page contains all the detailed tour information. It has a number of important details that many people miss. Such as:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="98" class="alignright size-large wp-image-44478" src="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/c-1-600x98.png" alt="" srcset="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/c-1-600x98.png 600w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/c-1-300x49.png 300w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/c-1-768x125.png 768w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/c-1.png 1006w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><strong>Previous/Next section arrows:</strong> Above the map, dates, difficulty, and other details you can use the back and forth arrows to browse between the various sections of the whole tour. Each one contains details specific to that section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-44479 size-medium" src="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/b-1-300x92.png" alt="" width="300" height="92" srcset="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/b-1-300x92.png 300w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/b-1-600x184.png 600w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/b-1.png 708w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>Difficulty and &#8216;Far Out&#8217; rating:</strong> Beside each rating you can click on the <strong></strong> to see a definition. &#8216;Far Out&#8217; rating measures how far from typical this tour might be for the average person living in western nations. These ratings are a good way to compare the different sections of a tour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="171" class="alignright size-large wp-image-44480" src="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/i-1-600x171.png" alt="" srcset="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/i-1-600x171.png 600w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/i-1-300x86.png 300w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/i-1-768x219.png 768w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/i-1.png 1271w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><strong>Cost:</strong> By clicking the <strong></strong> you can choose to show the (roughly) equivalent amount in your home currency. Note that all our tours are priced in a specific currency (USD, CAD, or EUR) but you can pay in a number of other currencies and we help you figure out the exchange rate at the time of payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="109" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-44481" src="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/a-1-300x109.png" alt="" srcset="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/a-1-300x109.png 300w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/a-1.png 486w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><strong>Tour status:</strong> Look for a stamp like this marking a tour as either &#8216;Limited Space&#8217;, &#8216;Guaranteed Departure&#8217; or &#8216;Fully Booked.&#8217; Not every tour has one of these badges and we review the status of a tour continually as the tour start date draws closer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="164" class="alignright size-large wp-image-44482" src="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/d-1-600x164.png" alt="" srcset="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/d-1-600x164.png 600w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/d-1-300x82.png 300w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/d-1-768x210.png 768w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/d-1.png 1018w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><strong>Which bike:</strong> Scroll down a little further and you will see that we share the recommended bike type and tire size for this particular tour or section of a tour. For some tours a touring bike with 35-40C tires is adequate, whereas some of the more rugged sections we might suggest wider tires, or even a mountain bike. We never recommend a road racing bike for any of our tours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="154" class="alignright size-large wp-image-44483" src="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/f-1-600x154.png" alt="" srcset="https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/f-1-600x154.png 600w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/f-1-300x77.png 300w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/f-1-768x197.png 768w, https://tdaglobalcycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/f-1.png 1404w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><strong>Downloadable schedule:</strong> For most of our tours, we make the daily itinerary available as a free download. Note that these are sample schedules and the &#8216;official&#8217; schedule gets shared with registered riders closer to the tour start date. But the sample schedules are a good way to see the proposed dates, distances, and daily destinations.</p>

For those seriously considering a tour, these details can be extremely helpful in making your choice.</p>
