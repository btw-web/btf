<p>Entering Iran by bicycle I was scared. Where would we sleep? How would an Australian and Swiss be received? Would we be in danger? Will these people resent our freedom to travel? Should we have just flown over Iran? Is it safe to travel to Iran?</p>
<p>Millions of questions and doubts flooded through my head as I handed over my passport at the border. Then, in that moment I realised, I have never met an Iranian. All I knew about Iran was received through news headlines. I have never tasted their food, I was completely unaware of their beautiful cities and at that point I had no idea of their incredibly hospitable culture.</p>
<p>The following 2 months cycling through Iran changed my life.</p>
<p>This video is for the Iranians, our new friends. I promised them that I would make a video to show our families and friends how kind Iranians were to us. We stayed in Iran for 60 days and we were hosted by locals 53 nights, the remaining 7 we were camping in the dessert.</p>
<p>This is our little voice for the people of Iran who are so restricted to cross their own borders. This is our voice to our families and friends, that regardless of politics and religious beliefs, Iranians are perhaps the most hospitable people you will ever meet.</p>
<p>I would love for you to experience Iran for yourself. Be brave and travel to Iran, they will show you just how kind we really can be to strangers.</p>
<p>Please share this video as far and wide as you can. Across all the borders that Iranians can’t travel. Let’s give the people of Iran a chance.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
