<h1>How to Cross the Black Sea by ferry</h1>
<p><strong>Ok, so you’ve come here for specifics on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how to cross the black sea by ferry</span>. The following details how to book your ticket and enjoy the truly magical experience of crossing the Black Sea by ferry. </strong></p>
<p>The following details and our experience is specific to crossing from Varna, Bulgaria to Poti, Georgia.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="#georgiatobulgaria">Jump to bottom of page for information regarding crossing from Poti, Georgia to Varna, Bulgaria.</a></span></p>
<p>So, from Varna, Buglaria to Poti, Georgia</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the information I am going to give you will not allow you to purchase or reserve a ticket. The current process requires you to arrive at the harbor on the morning of departure to purchase your ticket. However, we have a few contacts numbers and further information to make this adventure all possible, and yes it&#8217;s worth it.</p>
<h4>Who</h4>
<p>Navbul ferry company &#8211; <a href="http://www.navbul.com">www.navbul.com</a></p>
<p>Navbul ferry Agent &#8211; Atanas Ivanov<br />
mob:00359888449052<br />
email: <a href="mailto:ferry@navbul.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ferry@navbul.com</a></p>
<p>There is also an additional service called &#8220;PBM &#8211; Black Sea Ferry Services&#8221;, that I have no experience with<br />
<a href="http://www.pbm.bg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See their website</a></p>
<h4>What</h4>
<p>A Cargo ship, operated by Navbul. The ship transports goods, which is the major source of income for this company, not passengers.<br />
<a href="http://www.navbul.com/en/files/PRESENTATION_FERRY.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here for the companies PDF overview of their services.</a></p>
<h4>When</h4>
<p>• The Navbul Cargo ship/ferries will normally run, 3 or 4 times a month. No more<br />
• The <a href="http://www.navbul.com/en/main-activities/ferry/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cargo ship/ferry schedule</a> is very likely to change. The Cargo ship/ferry on occasions has left a DAY EARLY. (Our Cargo ship/ferry was scheduled for the 5th, but left on the 7th)<br />
• The Cargo ship/ferry timetable is issued one month ahead only.</p>
<h4>Where</h4>
<p>• The Cargo ship/ferry leaves from Varna (specifically Beloslov port, 28km from Varna),</p>

<p>Depending on cargo demand the ship/ferry will go to Poti or Batumi. Seems to be no rhyme or reasoning as to where and when these ships/ferries depart.</p>
<h4>How Much?</h4>
<p>• YOU MUST PAY IN CASH ON THE DAY (Euro or Bulgarian)<br />
(100 euro per person + 15 Euro per bike) There is absolutely no card/cheque/paypal alternatives.<br />
• It seems impossible to reserve a ticket. We could not, and the ticket operator would not let us.<br />
• Passengers are just a little extra cash on the side for the Ferry companies. Whilst they look after you very well on the boat, they are not too worried if you don’t make it to the boat/ship.</p>
<h4>Why</h4>
<p>• Trust us, all this stressing to get your ticket and cabin aboard will be worth it! An unforgettable journey awaits.</p>
<h3>Steps to ensure you have the best chance of getting on the Cargo ship/Ferry</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before you arrive in Varna</strong></span></p>
<p>• Log onto Navbul Ferries and check the schedule regularly.<br />
• Be prepared to wait in Varna, you might have to have accommodation in Varna booked for a few days, (Varna’s beaches are beautiful)<br />
• We recommend arriving in Varna at least 2 days before the intended departure of the ship.</p>
<p>Feel free to send an email to the Navbul ferry Agent &#8211; Atanas Ivanov (<a href="mailto:ferry@navbul.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ferry@navbul.com</a>) to establish contact.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When you arrive in Varna</strong></span></p>
<p>• Keep checking the Navbul ferry schedule daily<br />
• Call Atanas Ivanov (contact provided above – Navbul Agent) at 9am and check that the boat is not leaving a day early.<br />
• Call Atanas again two days before hand, then 1 day before hand, and then on the day just to touch base and let him know you will be waiting to buy the ticket.</p>
<p>Please note: (His English was so-so, better to get a local/hotel manager that speaks Bulgarian). He is control of the departure of the ship with all cargo onboard. He is a very busy man, be brief and precise with your call. Don’t expect too much love from a man under this sort of pressure.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the day of Departure</strong></span></p>
<p>Arrive at the Beloslov port, 28km from Varna, early at 8.45am (was the case for us, possibly another scenario for you, ask specifically what time)</p>
<p>Atanas Ivanov will suddenly appear at 9am and he will direct you to his office where you pay for your ticket. BRING PASSPORT COPIES (I am 99% sure we brought them with us and he requested them, If anyone travels with Navbul, please send me an email to confirm whether or not a passport copy is needed, i will update this blog page accordingly)</p>
<p>Be patient, very patient, the boat will leave at approximately 5pm that day.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On the Cargo ship/Ferry</strong></span></p>
<p>• Relax, its a wonderful journey. Bring a book, swimmers if in summer and a few snacks to get you through those moments you just need to snack.<br />
• There is no wifi on board.<br />
• Ask the crew for a tour of the engine room!</p>
<p>• You can buy alcohol from the passenger manager, he will not actively sell it, you will have to ask him<br />
• Ask the crew for a tour of the engine room</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Arriving in Georgia</strong></span></p>
<p>When you arrive in Poti, Georgia, the Visa for Georgia will be granted by Visa/border control officials. Visa/border control officials will board the boat and will go through your visa application passenger by passenger. It is all straight forward, but again, be patient.</p>
