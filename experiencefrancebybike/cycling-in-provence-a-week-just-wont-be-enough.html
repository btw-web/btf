<h1>Cycling In Provence:  A Week Just Won&#8217;t Be Enough!</h1>
<p>Provence was the first region in France I visited as a tourist and it&#8217;s been a favorite of mine ever since.  Despite my love of Provence, it was only several years ago that I had the courage to tour the region by bike. Like many people, I equated cycling in Provence with the Tour de France and killer hills&#8230;.the hills scared me to death.  The good news is that I took my first cycling trip there about 5 years ago, which led to a second and a third. I can&#8217;t wait to return there in 2018! There are lots of hills, after all Provence <strong>is</strong> home to the famous Giant of Provence–Mont Ventoux. But there are also many itineraries perfectly suited for recreational cyclists as well as a growing network of e-bike options for cycling the hilly terrain.</p>

<p>The weather is wonderful, the scenery varied and uniformly gorgeous and the food is spectacular&#8230;Provence should definitely be on your short list of regions to plan a cycling trip.  Do not discount this region because you&#8217;re afraid that the cycling may be too difficult!</p>

<p>The biggest challenge you&#8217;ll face if you choose Provence as your destination for an upcoming trip is deciding where to go and how long to stay. My favorite cycling area is the Vaucluse which is perfect for cycling almost any time of the year except when the Mistral winds are blowing. Don&#8217;t think that targeting the Vaucluse will make your trip planning easy, this will not be the case.  From the Roman towns of Vaison-la-Romaine and Orange to Chateauneuf-du-Pape and the famous Mont Ventoux, the lavender town of Sault, unforgettable Avignon, Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, the Venice of Provence and the hill towns of the Luberon, a week cycling in this part of Provence will never be enough!</p>

<p>There are 1500 kilometers of signposted circuits in the Vaucluse, most of which are on low-traffic rural roads.  Unlike long distance French cycling routes many of the itineraries in the Vaucluse are shorter distances, perfectly suited for a long weekend of cycling.</p>
<p>With Mont Ventoux at its center, this region has long been a popular destination for bicycling enthusiasts and professional cyclists. I had always imagined this land of the Tour de France to be the domain of experts, not an area welcoming to an average recreational cyclist like me. That opinion changed when I had the opportunity to explore the area by bike, both a regular bike and an e-bike.  For recreational cyclists, there&#8217;s no question this is an area where planning is important, but to experience this part of France by bike is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

<p>Since the hill towns of Provence are a favorite cycling destination of mine, I use this website a lot, and am happy to report that <a href="http://www.veloloisirprovence.com/en">VeloLoisir Provence</a> continues to improve it every year.  This organization has long advocated the development of cycling circuits and services in the Luberon and the Verdon Natural Regional Park, an area that extends from the Alps to the Mediterranean, from Cavaillon in the Vaucluse to the Alpes de Haute Provence.  It includes well-known Provencal villages like Apt, Cavaillon, Gordes, Roussillon, Lacoste, Menerbes and Loumarin, just to name a few. There are many incredible itineraries to explore by bike, including the popular<a href="http://www.veloloisirprovence.com/en/luberon/circuit/autour-du-luberon-velo"> Autour du Luberon a Velo</a>, a 236km adventure around the Luberon Regional Natural Park on a route signposted in both directions. Regardless of the type of information you are looking for, if it has to do with cycling in the Luberon, you&#8217;ll find it here!</p>

<p>Numerous stages of the <a href="https://en.viarhona.com/the-route">ViaRhona</a> are complete, particularly those near Geneva. Unfortunately much of the route in Provence is still in development, but this website is a great place to visit regularly to monitor progress.  I&#8217;d love to explore this route next year, so will be reporting on stages of the route as they are completed.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.location-velo-provence.com/en/">Sun-e-Bike</a></strong></p>
<p>If the terrain of Provence still seems too challenging to you, I highly recommend you consider experiencing this region by electric bike!  Exploring the hill towns of Provence by e-bike several years ago was one of my favorite cycling experiences&#8230;..one I will never forget.  You can read about my experience cycling in Provence last summer on a Sun-e-Bike by <a href="https://experiencefrancebybike.com/bicycling-in-provence-sun-e-bike-day-1/">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>Sun-e-Bike has helped make Provence accessible to recreational cyclists by developing a network for exploring this challenging region with the help of electric bikes. From its first location in the gorgeous town of Bonnieux, the company has expanded to three additional locations: Saint Remy, Vaison-la-Romaine and Chateauneuf du Pape. You can easily spend a week exploring the itineraries in Bonnieux, or you can choose two or more locations to explore.</p>

<p>One of my favorite areas of Provence is the vicinity around L&#8217;Isle-sur-la-Sorgue. Called the Venice of Provence, this town is gorgeous, quite unlike anywhere else in France.  This is a perfect Provencal town to spend a long weekend, or  longer. Warning:  the longer you stay, the longer you will want to stay.  There is something about this town that makes it hard to leave.  It&#8217;s a perfect town to base yourself out of for a long weekend, taking day cycling trips to explore the surrounding countryside.</p>

<p>Fortunately there is a wonderful website to help you plan a cycling holiday in this area.  Cycling in the Pays des Sorgues has detailed information on five cycling itineraries, all of which are rated easy and suitable for families.  Most can be done easily in a day. <img data-attachment-id="7023" data-permalink="https://experiencefrancebybike.com/cycling-in-provence-a-week-just-wont-be-enough/screen-shot-2017-03-18-at-5-30-10-pm/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-18-at-5.30.10-PM.png?fit=1674%2C1172&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1674,1172" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2017-03-18 at 5.30.10 PM" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-18-at-5.30.10-PM.png?fit=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-18-at-5.30.10-PM.png?fit=1024%2C717&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7023" src="https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-18-at-5.30.10-PM.png?resize=925%2C648&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="925" height="648" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-18-at-5.30.10-PM.png?resize=1024%2C717&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-18-at-5.30.10-PM.png?resize=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-18-at-5.30.10-PM.png?resize=768%2C538&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-18-at-5.30.10-PM.png?resize=1100%2C770&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-18-at-5.30.10-PM.png?resize=1400%2C980&amp;ssl=1 1400w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-18-at-5.30.10-PM.png?resize=800%2C560&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-18-at-5.30.10-PM.png?resize=600%2C420&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-18-at-5.30.10-PM.png?w=1674&amp;ssl=1 1674w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Important note, the directions for the itineraries are only in one direction and signposting can be sporadic, so travel with a GPS is highly suggested. We had some pretty good adventures last year making our way along the route! In addition to detailed information on the specific itineraries in the area, the website also has information on places to stay, where to eat and where to rent bicycles.</p>
<p>The last suggested resource I would recommend if you are planning on cycling in the Vaucluse region is a good map. For this particular region, I like the IGN Map series, Carpentras, Vaison-la-Romaine, Dentelle de Montmirail (#3040ET). Don&#8217;t purchase this map online as you&#8217;ll probably get an outdated copy of the map. You can purchase this map in a local bookstore, sporting goods store or tobacco shop after you arrive in France.</p>
<p>I hope I&#8217;ve enticed you to consider choosing Provence for an upcoming cycling trip, or to add a cycling component to an upcoming trip.  No matter how many times you travel to this part of France, you&#8217;ve never experienced it the way you will on a bike!</p>
