<h1>The Insider&#8217;s Guide to Bicycling France for Less</h1>
<p><em>By Maggie LaCoste</em></p>
<p>Experience France by Bike is for people who want to bike in France without spending a fortune.  Whether you want to go it alone, take a self-guided or guided trip from a tour company, Experience France by Bike is your guide to doing it for less.  Recreational biking in France, or in Europe in general has never been safer, easier or more affordable.  So if like me, you&#8217;re not interested in spending $4,000/week for a guided bike tour, let Experience France by Bike show you how to do it cheaper.</p>
<p>Over the last 10 years, there has been a quiet revolution going on in Europe, the development of a major network of limited traffic cycle paths. Europe is now covered with thousands of miles of cycle routes, including 12 Eurovelo routes that criss-cross the entire continent.  Recreational biking is a big deal in Europe, and the expansion of limited traffic cycle routes has been a major boom to the tourist industry throughout Europe, especially during the recent economic downturn.  Nowhere is this more true than in France, which has undergone a remarkable expansion of greenways and cycle routes in the last seven years. If you&#8217;re familiar with my blog, you know that France is my number one choice for biking in Europe, a choice I talk about in my post, <a title="10 Reasons to Bike in France" href="https://experiencefrancebybike.com/10-reasons-to-choose-france-for-your-next-bike-trip/" target="_blank">10 Reasons to Bike in France</a>. France is simply a paradise for the recreational cyclist!</p>

<p>Unfortunately easily accessible information on this new generation of cycle routes has not kept pace with the development of the routes themselves. Most biking books on France are outdated, written well before the new cycle routes were introduced.  And with new paths being introduced every month, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to access the most up to date route information.</p>
<p>This is the reason I started Experience France By Bike.  My goal is to provide you with insider information so that you can plan your own bicycling adventure in France without spending a fortune.  Whether you&#8217;re new to biking in Europe and France, whether you want to bike a little or a lot, whether you want to bike on your own, with your family, or with a group, Experience France by Bike will provide you with the information and advice you need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>What are the best routes, what to expect on the road, how far to bike each day, what&#8217;s it like to camp in France, how to save money on hotels, should you rent or bring your own bike and how to save money on eating and drinking are just some of the topics that will be covered in the upcoming weeks. I&#8217;ll also share information with you on how I plan my own trips, and the friends and resources I make, long before I even leave for my trip.</p>
<p>I hope that Experience France by Bike will help you learn more about traveling in France by bike.  And I hope it will encourage you to think about planning your own bike adventure in France, or to add a weekend bike trip to an already-planned trip.</p>
<p>Until the next time, I am always dreaming of biking in France!</p>
