<h1>Planning A Cycling Trip To Provence</h1>
<p>While many are dreaming of a white Christmas, a lot of cyclists are dreaming of a new adventure for 2014.  But planning a perfect bicycling trip can be time consuming and frustrating for the average recreational cyclist.  Up to date information on cycling routes can be difficult to find and plotting daily distances for a region you&#8217;re not familiar with can be challenging. This is definitely the case in Provence, a region peppered with mountains such as Mont Ventoux, the Alpilles and Dentelles de Montmirail and the Luberon.  One small miscalculation in route planning can lead to a major vacation disaster as you find yourself headed directly for the mountains!  This was my biggest fear this summer when I planned two trips to Provence:  one to the Luberon and one to the region around Mont Ventoux.  I&#8217;ve learned that regardless of how well you plan, there&#8217;s a lot of room for error when you are actually on the road!</p>

<p>Because of the mountains, planning your first bike trip to Provence is definitely a bit more challenging than planning a bike trip to routes like the Loire, La Velodyssee or the Nantes-Brest Canal.  But the payoff will be one of the most spectacular bicycling adventures of your life.  There is nothing to compare to bicycling in Provence.  Don&#8217;t abandon your dreams of a perfect Provence bicycling trip in 2014 if the planning gets complicated. Take advantage of the <a title="Vaucluse Office of Tourisme" href="http://www.provenceguide.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vaucluse Office of Tourism</a> website. The cycling section on this website is great.  If you still feel like you need a bit more support on your first cycling trip to Provence, here are two suggestions that can help you enjoy bicycling Provence like an insider.  Both options are Provence-based companies with years of experience in bicycle touring in the region. Their experience insures that you&#8217;ll have access to the best cycling routes in the region and insider information to help you to enjoy Provence in a way few tourists do.</p>

<p>Rides are zoned off into 6 different areas around the farmhouse called Memories de Provence. The zones are mostly flat to rolling hills, suited to average level cyclists.  The minimum distance is around 35 kms which can be limited to almost no climbing to a max of 400 meters of climbing, depending on the zone. The beauty of the GPS is the ability to create whatever experience a guest wants: you can bike a little or a lot, bike the flats or the hills, sightsee a little or a lot. The GPS system works just like your car GPS with color maps and verbal prompts before each junction.  In the unlikely event that you have a mechanical problem, full support and transport are just a phone call away.  To read more about a typical week tour, <a title="Typical tour with Provence Cycling Holidays" href="http://www.provence-cycling-holidays.com/typical_tour.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Owners Neil and Natalene Cowell have been living and cycling in the area for more than 10 years, so they are able to show you a side of Provence that few tourists get to see.  All rides start from the farmhouse and travel mostly along quiet countryside backroads with little traffic. Areas covered in the GPS include:  Fontaine de Vaucluse and Isle-sur-la-Sorgue to the west, Gordes and Rousillon to the northeast, Menerbes, Oppede le Vieux and Les Taillades to the south along with the petit Luberon, Apt and Bonnieux, Lacoste and Goult to the east.  Rides include some of the most spectacular hill villages in Provence, as well as vineyards, chateaux, orchards, cherry groves and miles and miles of lavender fields.</p>

<p>Oppede-le-Vieux, Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, the Abbaye of Senanque, Fontaine de Vaucluse, Gordes, one of the most beautiful villages in France, Roussillon, Saignon, Rustrel, Cereste, la Bastide des Jourdans, Lourmarin, Mallemort, Eygalieres, St Remy de Provence, Graveson and Chateaurenard.</p>
<p>It would be extremely difficult to visit all of these towns in 7 days on a normal bike, but on a Sun-e-Bike, it&#8217;s easy.  Traveling around the hill towns of Provence by e-bike is a great experience for even the most novice of bicyclists. And for the more experienced cyclist, don&#8217;t underestimate the fun and adventure of traveling by e-bike until you have tried it.  There&#8217;s an exhilaration that you experience on an e-bike that is unlike anything you&#8217;ve ever done before!  I&#8217;ve not taken this particular tour, but it&#8217;s definitely on my list of trips that I would love to take!</p>
<p>Sun-e-Bike package tours offer different price levels based on the type of lodging chosen.  Seven night packages with accommodation in a 2* hotel start at 105Euro/night, based on 2 people per room, in a B&amp;B from 108Euro/night per person and from 132Euro/night per person in a 3* hotel.  Included in this rate are rental of an e-bike for 8 days, 7 nights in the hotel category of choice, 7 breakfasts, a road book with detailed route information and attractions, and 24 hour emergency assistance.  Available options include taxi transfer from Avignon to Bonnieux and daily luggage transfer.  For more information about package tours with Sun-e-Bike, contact Florian at:  contact@sun-e-bike.com.</p>
