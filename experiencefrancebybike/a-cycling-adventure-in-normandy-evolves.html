<h1>A Cycling Adventure in Normandy Evolves</h1>
<p>My trip is proving to be more of an adventure than I ever imagined! Since we left Utah Beach and headed south, each day has been full of adventure and challenge. For three nights we haven&#8217;t arrived at our destination until after 6:30, with barely enough energy left to stretch, shower and have dinner before falling asleep.</p>
<p>Today was a day that all cyclists, regardless of ability levels dreads, a rainy day. This was a rainy day unlike I&#8217;ve ever seen on a bike, from the moment we began until we arrived at Ducey tonight, it poured. I have never been so wet or so muddy on a bike before.</p>
<p>We did have some rather funny interactions with the locals in a town called Le Neufbourg, just north of Mortain where we stopped for a hot lunch. Being as today is Monday, many places, especially out in the country are closed. One of the few places open in Le Neufbourg was the local bar/cafe, perfect for 2 soaking wet cyclists coming in from the rain. Everywhere we walked in the restaurant we left puddles. We were definitely the center of attention at this local lunch hot spot. Everyone in the place could not believe we were cycling in such terrible weather! I will never forget the kindness and hospitality that they extended to my husband and me on such a challenging day. Their attempts to get us to stay the afternoon and ride out the rain was tempting, but we finally said goodbye and headed towards our destination for the night in Ducey.</p>
<p>We finally arrived, once again late, and once again tired. I haven&#8217;t even had the energy to write. I am looking forward to having some time in the upcoming days to fill you in on my further adventures in Normandy. Until then, greetings from Ducey.</p>
