<h1>Bicycling EuroVelo 6 In The Doubs Valley:  Where To Stay?</h1>
<p>I love the Doubs Valley section of EuroVelo 6 in France so much that I&#8217;m returning to this year to do additional research for a new e-guide on the area. Based on recent e-mails, it looks like many of you will also be venturing to this part of EuroVelo 6 too. If so, there&#8217;s an important piece of advice I&#8217;d like to pass on to you: make sure you plan ahead on where to stay, particularly between Besancon and Montbeliard.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.eurovelo6-france.com/troncons/montbeliard-dole" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seven stages of EuroVelo 6</a> pass through the Doubs Valley in Bourgogne Franche-Comte.  For almost 160km, cyclists are treated to spectacular scenery from the beautiful towns of Dole to Montbeliard with the amazing town of Besancon in the middle. While there are plenty of places to stay in each of these larger towns, it&#8217;s between them where there&#8217;s a bit of a problem, a small price to pay for enjoying some of the most spectacular scenery along EuroVelo 6!<img data-attachment-id="7824" data-permalink="https://experiencefrancebybike.com/bicycling-eurovelo-6-in-the-doubs-valley-where-to-stay/deluzindoubs-1/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deluzindoubs-1.jpg?fit=1365%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1365,1024" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;COOLPIX AW130&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1500351461&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.3&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;125&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.00125&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="deluzindoubs &#8211; 1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deluzindoubs-1.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deluzindoubs-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7824 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deluzindoubs-1.jpg?resize=925%2C694&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="925" height="694" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deluzindoubs-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deluzindoubs-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deluzindoubs-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deluzindoubs-1.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deluzindoubs-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deluzindoubs-1.jpg?resize=1100%2C825&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deluzindoubs-1.jpg?resize=1400%2C1050&amp;ssl=1 1400w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deluzindoubs-1.jpg?resize=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/experiencefrancebybike.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deluzindoubs-1.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>The beautiful village of Deluz in the Doubs Valley</strong></p>
<p>The distance from Besancon to Montbeliard is just under 100km, a bit too far to cycle in one day. When I planned my first trip to the area last year, I didn&#8217;t make many advance reservations. I learned this was a big mistake in this area.  Even though no lodging options showed up on the EV6 pictogram of the Doubs Valley, or on Google Maps, I thought this was a mistake. But I learned there really are just few places to stay on this section of the route, especially between Baume-les-Dames and Montbeliard. And these options are small with less than a handful of rooms all together!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re planning a bicycling trip along EuroVelo 6 from Montbeliard to Besancon, and you&#8217;d like to stay overnight somewhere between the 2, here are some suggestions of places on/near the cycle route. Most are small B&amp;B&#8217;s or gites with only a couple of rooms, so be sure to make your plans early, especially if you&#8217;re visiting during the busy summer months!</p>

<p>I came upon it last summer quite by accident, and I was thrilled there was a room available, otherwise I would have had to cycle another 26km on a very hot day!  La Maison Au Canal is owned by Anne-Marie and Helmut Schmidt, two of the nicest, friendliest people you&#8217;ll ever meet. They make an overnight stay here something to be remembered!  There are 4 rooms, 2 of which have a shower and sink in the room, but share a toilet down the hall. Rooms here are a bit old-fashioned, but are clean and cozy and breakfast is included.  You can contact Anne-Marie at:  maison-au-canal@tcnet.ch.</p>

This gorgeous renovated farmhouse has 4 rooms priced from 70€/night for 2 people. There is also a gite available for rent, perfect for a group or family traveling together.  This lodging option is very popular, so inquire early if you are interested.  Because it&#8217;s located out of the town, dinner options without a car are limited, but the grounds are perfect for a candlelight picnic dinner!  For further information, contact: bered@orange.fr.</p>

<p>There may be options near the bike path that I&#8217;ve not included, but I hope that those included will be of some help to you in your trip planning. Who knows, we may end up seeing each other at one of them this summer!  In the meantime, here&#8217;s one more photo that capture just a bit of the beauty of the Doubs Valley.</p>
