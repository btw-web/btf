<p>most famous Roman towns in France, Vaison la Romaine.  I&#8217;ve bicycled in both areas and the roads can be quite hilly, especially around Vaison la Romaine, so the thought of being able to explore both areas by electric bike is very exciting.  The hilly terrain in each of the Sun-e-Bikes service areas makes them ideal to explore by e-bike.  Were it not for an e-bike, I never would have explored so many of the gorgeous Luberon hill towns.</p>

<p>There aren&#8217;t enough superlatives to describe the adventure of traveling the hilly terrain of Provence on a Sun-e-Bike. No matter how hard I try to put the experience I words, nothing seems to capture the experience adequately.  Discovering the backroads of Provence by e-bike is a once in a lifetime experience, allowing you to see this spectacular region in a way few tourists experience.</p>
<p>There’s no question you still get plenty of exercise cycling, but when you need that extra oomph to get up a steep hill or to power through a strong headwind, the power magically kicks in. Depending on the level of power you select, it can really kick in!</p>

<p>There&#8217;s definitely a learning curve to riding these e-bikes, but anyone can master it in 5 minutes or less!  A quick lesson in the details: how to shift, using low gears when going uphill, how to use the three different levels of e-power and you are good to go.  In 5-10 minutes you&#8217;ll feel like a pro on your Sun-e-Bike!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re planning to be in any of these towns for an upcoming vacation, I highly recommend that you consider spending a day or better yet, a weekend exploring on a Sun-e-Bike.  Whether you choose to spend a day or two or a week, seeing Provence by e-bike is an experience you will never forget!</p>
