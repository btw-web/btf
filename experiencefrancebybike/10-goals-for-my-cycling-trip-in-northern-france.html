<h1>10 Goals For My Cycling Trip In Northern France</h1>
<p>I am so excited to begin a new bicycling adventure in France! It seems that every year, I come home with many things I wished I had done more of. This year, I made a list, in advance of things I want to take advantage of, so I will hopefully have fewer regrets. Here is my list:</p>
<p>1. Eat at least one local treat a day. Whether it&#8217;s biscuits in the shape of parachutes or some other pastry specialty, I&#8217;m going to try at least one every day. Who knows, I may find a new favorite to replace canele from Bordeaux!<br />
2. Try Normandy cider. I&#8217;m not a big drinker, but trying Normandy cider hardly requires a major indulgence, but who knows, maybe I will love it, who knows!<br />
3. Eat local mussels. The bouchot mussels from Mont Saint Michel are supposedly some of the best in the world. Seems silly not to try them!<br />
4. Go to every D-Day museum that I can. Since I am fortunate enough to make this trip to bicycle the D-Day to Mont Saint Michel itinerary, I want to experience every part of the history of this event. I know in advance that going to some of these museums will be very emotional. A small price to pay tribute to so many brave people.<br />
5. Try all the local specialties at least once. Salt Meadow lamb, butter from Normandy, galettes, calvados, camembert cheeses, all should be no problem. I &#8216;m not so certain about andouille from Saint Lo though. I may need a few glasses of Normandy cider before I try andouille.<br />
6. Take time to make at least one new acquaintance each day, and savor each experience. Meeting amazing people is always a favorite part of each bicycling vacation. I hope to have more of these great experiences this trip.<br />
7. Embrace every day, even the tough ones on the bike. OK, I&#8217; m bicycling in Normandy and Brittany, land of rain, so I know there many be at least one day of poor weather (actually will be happy if it&#8217;s only one). So I will try to be upbeat about that if it happens. I also will embrace the long days, and just enjoy the adventure and challenge of traveling by bike.<br />
8. Take more photos. No matter how many photos I take, it&#8217;s never enough. I will take more!<br />
9. Find more local markets. I will end this trip at the Saturday market in Rennes, the second largest market in France. I am so looking forward to this, but also want to seek out the great small local markets where I can hear great stories from the vendors, who have all the time in the world to talk!<br />
10. Make the most of the adventure of traveling by bike. Take deviations, try a different route, try out that funky cafe for an espresso, join the locals for a pastis at 10 in the morning. I&#8217;m traveling in France by bike, so I will embrace the adventure every day!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my list. If I am able to check every one of these from my list, this will be one spectacular vacation! Tomorrow, my trip to Saint Marie du Mont and Utah Beach.</p>
