<h1>Bike Rental Options for Summer Travel in France</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty picky about bikes that I rent when I travel.  Rightfully so.  If you&#8217;ve ever been stranded with a flat tire and a bad replacement inner tube in your rental-supplied repair kit, you know exactly what I mean!  As a result, I&#8217;m partial to bike rental companies that are owned and operated by bike mechanics or former cycling racers.  They understand how important regular maintenance is to optimal performance, thus insuring my odds for an enjoyable, incident-free rental.  When I find a rental shop that earns my trust, I&#8217;m happy to pass that resource on to you.</p>
<p>So just in time for summer vacation season, here are two great additions to my list of recommended bike rentals in France!</p>
<p>If you are planning a bicycling trip to Western France, your first stop for bike rentals should be <a title="Bike rentals at Bikever" href="http://www.bikever.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bikever</a>.  Bikever may be a new bike rental company, but it&#8217;s owners are hardly new to bike rentals and bike touring in France.  Bikever is the brainchild of Norbert Audoin, owner of <a title="O2Cycles in Bordeaux" href="http://www.o2cycles.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">O2Cycles</a> of Bordeaux and Jonathan Sculier.  I have known Norbert Audoin for several years and during this time we have become good friends.  The service and reliability of O2Cycle rentals has become the standard that I look for in all of my European bike rentals.  The German Cube hybrid that Norbert rents is my favorite bike to rent for touring in France and I&#8217;m excited that this bike will now be available to rent in Western France through <a title="Bike rentals in Western France through Bikever" href="http://www.bikever.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bikever</a>.  As a matter of fact, I will be renting the Cube for my summer bicycling trip in Normandy and Brittany.</p>
<p>Bikever can supply bikes anywhere in Western France.  Road bikes are the lighweight GT GTR Series 1, mountain and road bikes are high quality such as the German Cube, one of my favorites. Bikever also rents the popular Lapierre Prorace kid&#8217;s bike.  Luggage carriers, infant trailers, and Ortleib and Vaude panniers are also available for rent.  Note, road bikes are provided without pedals, so be sure to bring your own for road bike rentals.</p>
<p>Rental rates may vary from year to year, but at the time of this post, rates began at 30 Euro/day for road bikes to 20 Euro/day for mountain bikes and hybrids, to 15 Euro/day for kids bikes. Week long rentals are 175 Euro for road bikes, and 130 Euro for mountain bikes and hybrids, and 75 Euro for kids&#8217; bikes, once again, depending on when you read this post, rates may have changed, so be sure to check the website for current rates.  There also may be a minimum rental period during June and July, especially for road bikes.  Check the website to get the latest rental prices.</p>
<p>Delivery and retrieval of bikes is free of charge within a 10 mile radius of Bordeaux.  For information on delivery in all other areas, contact Norbert or Jonathan or simply send a note requesting a custom quote.  All rentals include a heavy-duty anti-theft bicycle chain, a speedometer, a reflective safety jacket, an inner tube, self-adhesive inner tube patches, an air pump and multi-tool kit which includes a 4-6 mm Allen Key, and flat and crosshead screwdrivers.</p>
