<h1>12 Crucial Qualities Of A Bicycle Traveller’s Perfect Tent</h1>

<p>Interested in why bicycle travellers tend to prefer certain types of tent? Let’s explore in detail a few of the key criteria – I’ve identified twelve, to be precise – that might cause a cycle tourer or bikepacker to choose one tent over another in this overly crowded market.</p>



<p>The perfect tent, of course, does not exist, because there is no such thing as perfection! But if it did, it would probably…</p>



<h4>1. Weigh as little as possible</h4>



<p>The less weight you’re carrying, the nimbler and more enjoyable to ride your bike will be while you’re on it, and the more manageable it’ll be while you’re off&nbsp;it.</p>



<p>In the old days, tents were built of heavy canvas, wood and steel, and weighed as much as a bicycle. Modern tents, by contrast, are now absurdly light.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ideal touring tent would, therefore, weigh as little as possible when packed – particularly important for <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/whats-really-the-difference-between-bikepacking-cycle-touring/">bikepackers</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="435" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/terra-nova-starlite-2-review-21-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=580%2C435&#038;ssl=1" alt class="wp-image-14347" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/terra-nova-starlite-2-review-21-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/terra-nova-starlite-2-review-21-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/terra-nova-starlite-2-review-21-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/terra-nova-starlite-2-review-21-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/terra-nova-starlite-2-review-21-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/terra-nova-starlite-2-review-21-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1980%2C1485&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/terra-nova-starlite-2-review-21-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=750%2C563&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/terra-nova-starlite-2-review-21-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/terra-nova-starlite-2-review-21-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?w=1740&amp;ssl=1 1740w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The Terra Nova Starlite 2 tunnel tent manages to sleep two people in a compact, lightweight package.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>2. Last as long as possible</h4>



<p>The importance of durability increases in parallel with the length of your journey. Modern tents do have a limited lifespan and on an ultra-long tour can almost be considered a consumable item, most multi-year journeys involving a series of&nbsp;tents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Common points of failure include zip sliders wearing out, floors losing waterproofness, poles fatiguing and snapping under stress, and flysheets shrinking through prolonged UV exposure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long-term riders especially therefore tend to choose tents whose durability has proven itself over&nbsp;time.</p>

<h4>3. Pitch anywhere</h4>



<p>Especially when wild-camping, perfect pitching conditions can never be guaranteed. As well as this, a long tour may well incorporate a variety of environments.</p>



<p>The perfect tent would go up anywhere, regardless of the availability of flat, level ground, and with or without the ability to use pegs/stakes. </p>



<p>That is, rather simplistically, why cyclists tend to choose freestanding tents, in which the poles support the whole structure, or tents requiring minimal staking out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="387" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/14449788543_78d69ba858_o.jpg?resize=580%2C387&#038;ssl=1" alt class="wp-image-18298" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/14449788543_78d69ba858_o-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/14449788543_78d69ba858_o-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/14449788543_78d69ba858_o-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/14449788543_78d69ba858_o-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/14449788543_78d69ba858_o-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/14449788543_78d69ba858_o-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/14449788543_78d69ba858_o-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C1320&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/14449788543_78d69ba858_o-scaled.jpg?resize=750%2C500&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/14449788543_78d69ba858_o-scaled.jpg?w=1740&amp;ssl=1 1740w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Even a £20 tent from Tesco can satisfy many of a cyclist’s needs.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>4. Blend into the background</h4>



<p>Successful <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/how-to-camp-anywhere-and-not-get-busted/">wild-camping</a> is largely about avoiding detection. Part of this is having a tent that does not stick out like a sore thumb in a landscape.</p>



<p>The ideal tent, therefore, would exhibit chameleon-like properties, blending perfectly into the surroundings. Tents with green or neutral-coloured flysheets are therefore a good bet, while bright orange or yellow mountaineering tents are less than preferable in this regard.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="386" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2561248403_2ab9f81ac9_o.jpg?resize=580%2C386&#038;ssl=1" alt class="wp-image-18281" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2561248403_2ab9f81ac9_o-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2561248403_2ab9f81ac9_o-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2561248403_2ab9f81ac9_o-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2561248403_2ab9f81ac9_o-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1021&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2561248403_2ab9f81ac9_o-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1362&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2561248403_2ab9f81ac9_o-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C798&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2561248403_2ab9f81ac9_o-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C1316&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2561248403_2ab9f81ac9_o-scaled.jpg?resize=750%2C499&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2561248403_2ab9f81ac9_o-scaled.jpg?w=1740&amp;ssl=1 1740w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Stealth-camping with neutral green tents in a park on the outskirts of Huntingdon.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>5. Go up quickly</h4>



<p>Once a suitable pitch has been found, the last thing a cycle traveller wants is to waste time pitching or tweaking an overly complicated tent, particularly in bad weather or when stealth-camping under cover of darkness.</p>



<p>This, again, is one of the reasons why cyclists tend to prefer freestanding tents with simple, ideally one-piece, pole structures, which are pitched in a few seconds, all stakes and guy lines being optional.</p>

<h4>6. Keep you dry in a monsoon</h4>



<p>Any tent worth its salt will keep its occupants dry. The best tents will do so in a torrential downpour and on waterlogged ground, and many riders will have to anticipate such conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In practice, this means choosing a tent with an additional footprint to provide extra waterproofing to the floor, an adjustable fly sheet that can be cinched down closer to the ground to avoid splashback, and a good level of protection around the edges of the inner tent as well. It might also mean a footprint that extends to cover the space beneath the awning where your gear is being stowed.</p>

<h4>7. Stand up in a hurricane</h4>



<p>Extreme weather, by definition, is the exception rather than the norm. But the longer the trip, the higher the chances of being exposed to&nbsp;it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ideal tent would take stormy weather in its stride, remaining firmly planted even whilst houses, pets and automobiles are being blown clean&nbsp;away.</p>



<p>So-called ‘geodesic’ and tunnel tents tend to do well in strong winds when properly pitched and oriented, while wedge-shaped tents are among the worst performers in this&nbsp;sense.</p>

<h4>8. Ventilate in all climates</h4>



<p>Climate control is a perpetual concern for the camper. Condensation in particular can contribute far more to a soggy night’s sleep than rainfall itself.</p>



<p>The ideal tent would feature adjustable ventilation options for all circumstances, including plentiful mesh panels on the inner so it can be pitched alone in hot weather and allow a good breeze to come through.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="435" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hennessy-hammock-hex-fly-2-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=580%2C435&#038;ssl=1" alt class="wp-image-14978" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hennessy-hammock-hex-fly-2-tomsbiketrip-com-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hennessy-hammock-hex-fly-2-tomsbiketrip-com-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hennessy-hammock-hex-fly-2-tomsbiketrip-com-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hennessy-hammock-hex-fly-2-tomsbiketrip-com-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hennessy-hammock-hex-fly-2-tomsbiketrip-com-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hennessy-hammock-hex-fly-2-tomsbiketrip-com-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hennessy-hammock-hex-fly-2-tomsbiketrip-com-scaled.jpg?resize=1980%2C1485&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hennessy-hammock-hex-fly-2-tomsbiketrip-com-scaled.jpg?resize=750%2C563&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/hennessy-hammock-hex-fly-2-tomsbiketrip-com-scaled.jpg?w=1740&amp;ssl=1 1740w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Even the best-ventilated tent will never perform as well as a good camping hammock such as the Hennessy.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>9. Provide a view when you want&nbsp;it</h4>



<p>Tents are enclosed and often claustrophobic spaces designed to isolate and protect from the elements. But when the elements are at their most desirable, the ideal tent will provide a viewing platform from which to drink all that natural beauty up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This usually means choosing a tent with an awning that can be tied right back and a mesh panel on the inner door to look through, if not a full mesh inner&nbsp;tent.</p>

<h4>10. Give you privacy when you need&nbsp;it</h4>



<p>Sometimes, after a long day on the road, all you’ll want to do is retreat to a save haven. The ideal tent will feel as secure, safe and impermeable as a padded cell.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you think it’ll be warm and dry enough to pitch only the inner tent without the rainfly, a full mesh inner will afford no privacy whatsoever. A tent with a combination of mesh and fabric panels, on the other hand, may strike a better balance.</p>

<h4>11. Allow room for all your luggage</h4>



<p>Tents being necessarily restricted in size for practical reasons, it’s usually possible to bring some of your belongings inside, but often it’ll be necessary to leave at the very least your bicycle to brave the elements overnight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ideal tent provides space for everything to be brought inside or stowed in the awning – perhaps even the&nbsp;bike.</p>

<h4>12. Provide space to&nbsp;live</h4>



<p>In a similar vein to the above, tents are more or less well designed for doing anything other than sleeping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ideal tent will exhibit Tardis-like qualities, providing space to unpack, rearrange, work, play, get changed, entertain guests, repair bicycles and more, in addition to simply sleeping.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots">



<p>In reality, there is no single tent that ticks all of the above boxes. Choosing the right tent for your bike trip is about knowing what compromises you can safely make, and when you should stick to your&nbsp;guns.</p>



<p>Many of these compromises are common to a lot of riders, which is why a <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/whats-the-best-tent-for-cycle-touring/">small handful of tents</a> have emerged as long-time favourites among cycle tourers and bikepackers.</p>
