<h1>3 Adventure Travel Podcasts Worth Checking Out This Summer</h1>
<p>Podcasts come and go pretty frequently, so good ones are worth keeping bookmarked, as smartphones make it easier than ever before to listen to on-demand radio shows as you travel or whenever else the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>Rather than overwhelm you with a massive listing that you’ll never get round to sifting through, here are <strong>three podcast suggestions on the topic of travel and adventure</strong> I’ve come across over the last few months, all of which are well worth checking out if you’re looking for new listening material on the theme of travel, adventure, expeditions and the great outdoors.</p>
<p>(You may notice that I’ve previously been invited as a guest on&nbsp;these shows; needless to say there are plenty of far more interesting contributors in their back catalogues whose episodes you can listen to as&nbsp;well!)</p>
<h3>1. The Paul Kirtley Podcast</h3>
<p>After working for one of the best-known bushcraft schools in the UK, bushcraft instructor Paul Kirtley set up his own school, <a href="http://frontierbushcraft.com/">Frontier Bushcraft</a>, and now runs a highly successful <a href="http://paulkirtley.co.uk/">blog</a> on the subject of survival skills and outdoor living.</p>
<p>Paul is less interested in bushcraft for its own sake than as a set of skills for making journeys. And so don’t expect to find in-depth discussions on knife sharpening and firelighting. Instead, the interview-style podcast revolves around the stories of Paul’s adventurous contributors, what drives them, and what they’ve learned from their experiences.</p>
<p>His podcast is still quite new, but judging by the success of his first few episodes, which include interviews with hugely respected figures like Ray Goodwin, Tristan Gooley and Chris Townsend, I imagine it’ll quickly become one to watch. Or listen to. You know what I&nbsp;mean.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/the-paul-kirtley-podcast/id951373237?mt=2">Subscribe on iTunes</a>, or <a href="http://paulkirtley.co.uk/Topics/pkpodcast/">visit Paul’s webpage</a> for more listening options.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Zero To Travel</h3>
<p>Jason Moore’s approach with Zero To Travel is focused on sharing the experiences and knowledge of seasoned travellers in order to help newcomers to the world of travel tackle their concerns and get started with their adventures, as well as those who want to transition to living on the road full&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Also an interview-style podcast, Jason’s contributors are mainly experts on those topic which surround travel and adventure and enable it to happen more often, including travel hacking (for free and cheap flights and accommodation), self employment or so-called ‘digital nomadic’ living.</p>
<p>With over a hundred episodes to date and a five-star rating on iTunes, you won’t be running out of worthwhile listening material any time&nbsp;soon.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>3. Walking The&nbsp;Earth</h3>
<p>The host and creator of Walking The Earth, Mike Margolies, also set up his podcast to explore the full-time travel lifestyles of contributors around the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>His approach is very open-minded – you’ll hear more about lifestyle philosophy and spirituality from his interviewees than travel tips and techniques.</p>
<p>Because of this, his show (now 72 episodes strong and counting) and the projects and passions of his contributors are hugely diverse and meandering.</p>
