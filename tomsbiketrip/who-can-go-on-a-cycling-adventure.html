<h1>Who Can Go On A Cycling Adventure? (Hint: Not Only Cyclists)</h1>
<p>It is sometimes assumed that cycle touring is the exclusive domain of the lean and lycra-clad. Since when did a ‘normal’ person get on a bike and routinely crank out between fifty and a hundred miles a day without breaking a&nbsp;sweat?</p>
<p>That requires fitness, and therefore <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/how-to-train-for-long-distance-cycle-touring/">training</a>, and therefore a passion for sport and competition, and determination and pain. Which seemingly only describes a talented and slightly masochistic elite of cyclists.</p>
<p><strong>Except those baseline assumptions are&nbsp;false.</strong></p>
<p>Study the demographics of those actually out there wandering the world’s back roads on bicycles and you’ll find that very few are in it for the physicality or the challenge, or even for the cycling.</p>
<p>Athleticism is a beneficial byproduct of a mode of travel that&nbsp;<i>creates</i> fitness as it goes. The only requirement is the ability to ride a bike without falling off – something we all learn at an early age, and for most of us our first real taste of freedom. It’s that same freedom that attracts fully-grown adults back to their bicycles later&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Sure, if you’ve spent the last few years indulging a little too heavily in sofa- or office-based activities, you’re not going to hit the ground running, so to&nbsp;speak.</p>
<p><strong>But you don’t <em>need</em> to hit the ground running.</strong></p>
<p>Nobody’s waiting for you at a finish line with a stopwatch. You can take all the time you need to get where you’re going. Who’s going to know how long it took (except you), and does it matter if it takes a little longer? You’ll only see more of the world as you&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>You see, it won’t be long before you shift your attention away from your lacklustre mileage and towards the ever-changing landscape, the opportunities to explore, and the people and oddities you’ll stumble upon. You’ll find that slowness actually <i>amplifies</i> the intrigue of exploring new roads. Pedalling along, beholden to no-one and nothing, you’ll start to wonder:</p>
<p><strong>Why would anyone take the freedom afforded by the humble bicycle and squander it on a mad dash to the finish line?</strong></p>
<p>Allow days and weeks to pass by, and you’ll find that something even stranger happens.</p>
<p>The aches and pains subside. The saddle actually starts to feel rather comfortable, as though you’re ‘becoming one with the bike’. You’re no longer thinking about the cycling itself or how hard or strange it is, because it’s getting easier and more natural by the day as your experience grows, and you’ve got more interesting things to think about anyway. And the moment will come when you realise you’ve got on a bike that morning and cranked out a hundred leisurely miles without even noticing.</p>
<p>Because you, as a human, by applying yourself to something new, will have done what millions of years of evolution have optimised you&nbsp;for.</p>
<p><strong>You will have <i>adapted</i>.</strong></p>
<p>And so cycle touring – far from demanding a level of skill and strength available only to the chosen few – is in fact one of the most egalitarian types of adventure there&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>Try it. Take this simple man-powered machine, combine with your naturally curious spirit, and see where you end&nbsp;up.</p>
