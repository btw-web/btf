<h1>The Best Cheap (Sub-£1,000) Touring Bikes for Low-Budget Adventures</h1>

<p><em>Last updated in October 2020.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Autumn/fall is a transitional time in the cycling industry retail calendar, with this year’s models selling out and new stock starting to arrive. I will continuously update the listings below with 2021-season bikes as new information becomes available.</em></p>



<p class="has-large-font-size">As cycle touring and bikepacking have exploded in popularity, many manufacturers have begun producing <strong>cheap, entry-level touring bikes</strong> aimed at cyclists and travellers on a low budget.</p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">My all-time most viewed blog post, <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/which-touring-bike-should-i-buy/">What’s The Best Touring Bike?</a>, covers the most popular and reliable touring bikes across the budget spectrum. In this focused article, however, we’re going to have a specific look at some of the <em>cheapest</em> touring bikes that have stood the test of time and proven themselves reliable on real-world bike&nbsp;trips.</p>



<h4>What To Expect From A Cheap, Entry-Level Touring Bike</h4>



<p>When I say ‘low budget’ or ‘cheap’, don’t forget that a touring bike still needs the durability to cover a lot of miles while carrying a lot of luggage&nbsp;– otherwise it isn’t worth buying at&nbsp;all.</p>



<p><strong>In this article, I have classified a cheap, entry-level touring bike as any touring-specific bicycle with a recommended retail price (RRP) of GBP £1,000 or&nbsp;less.</strong></p>



<p>Why? Because the most popular ‘premium’ touring bikes cost <em>a lot more</em> than this. ‘Cheap’ is relative.</p>



<p>For under £1,000, you can expect to get a brand new touring bike from a reputable manufacturer that will serve you well if you understand its limitations.</p>



<p>And if you find a good clearance deal in the low season (see the note at the bottom of this article), you could pay even&nbsp;less.</p>



<p>Entry-level touring bikes are usually road-oriented, with classic touring geometry, 700C wheels, cantilever rim brakes, and drivetrain components taken from the budget end of Shimano’s mountain-biking or road component ranges.</p>



<p>They’ll generally be based on aluminium frames (which are cheaper to manufacture than steel), and will usually come with a basic rear rack and mudguards.</p>



<p>Don’t expect a front rack or lowrider to be included as standard, and expect contact parts like saddle, pedals, grips and tyres to be included to make the bike sellable, rather than because they’re good for long haul touring.</p>



<p>These bikes are a good choice if you want to give cycle touring a try but don’t want to invest too much in a high-end touring bike before you’re sure cycle touring is for you. If you choose carefully, entry-level touring framesets are often good for upgrading as your ambitions grow; and if you find you just don’t get on with bicycle travel, you can sell the bike and cut your losses.</p>



<p>All the usual <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/touring-bike-faq-6-whats-the-best-way-to-avoid-buying-the-wrong-bike/">advice regarding buying bikes online</a> applies equally with cheap touring bikes. Having said that, let’s have a look at some of the best-value options available today.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots">



<h3>Adventure Flat White (UK, £440)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="350" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/adventure_flat_white-1-e1522665656212-750x452.jpg?resize=580%2C350" alt class="wp-image-12020" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/adventure_flat_white-1-e1522665656212.jpg?resize=750%2C452&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/adventure_flat_white-1-e1522665656212.jpg?resize=300%2C181&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/adventure_flat_white-1-e1522665656212.jpg?resize=1024%2C618&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/adventure_flat_white-1-e1522665656212.jpg?resize=768%2C463&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/adventure_flat_white-1-e1522665656212.jpg?w=1187&amp;ssl=1 1187w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>First up from Adventure Outdoor Co (a sub-brand of Sportline, one of the UK’s biggest bicycle distributors) is the <a href="https://www.adventureoutdoor.co/bike/flat-white">Flat White</a>, part of their series of entry-level bikes. It’s an impressive effort to produce what is probably the cheapest off-the-peg touring bike on the market in the UK right&nbsp;now.</p>



<p>The cromoly steel frame in particular will attract a lot of interest, and it looks to be well thought out in terms of eyelets&nbsp;and braze-ons. The 2×7sp Tourney drivetrain isn’t going to impress anyone, but there’s no particular reason it wouldn’t take you a couple of thousand&nbsp;miles before needing attention – and spares for this range are abundant and&nbsp;cheap.</p>

<h3>Dawes Galaxy 2020 (UK, £700)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="406" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dawes-galaxy-2020.jpg?resize=580%2C406&#038;ssl=1" alt="Dawes Galaxy 2020 Touring Bike" class="wp-image-16440" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dawes-galaxy-2020.jpg?resize=750%2C525&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dawes-galaxy-2020.jpg?resize=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dawes-galaxy-2020.jpg?resize=1024%2C717&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dawes-galaxy-2020.jpg?resize=768%2C538&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dawes-galaxy-2020.jpg?resize=1536%2C1075&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dawes-galaxy-2020.jpg?resize=1200%2C840&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dawes-galaxy-2020.jpg?resize=1980%2C1386&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dawes-galaxy-2020.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dawes-galaxy-2020.jpg?w=1740&amp;ssl=1 1740w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p><em>Note that Dawes have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/tom_r_allen/status/1316308542245212161" target="_blank">sadly discontinued</a> the Galaxy line for 2021, citing several years of declining in sales. The below information relates to the 2020 Galaxy, a final few of which may still be available.</em></p>



<p>Long known as the archetypical British road touring bike, the Galaxy is the entry-level model in Dawes’ current range. For the money, you get a remarkably accomplished machine with one of the longest-running British bike manufacturers’ names behind it.</p>



<p>Very close on paper to the Ridgeback Tour (see below), the <a href="http://dawescycles.com/product/galaxy/">Galaxy</a> is fitted with Schwalbe Marathon tyres, which will get you across a continent or two before needing replacement. Gearing is definitely road-oriented, with a low ratio of 28×32.</p>



<ul><li>The Dawes Galaxy is one of the most widely available touring bikes in UK high street bike stores, so you may still find a few 2020 models up for&nbsp;sale.</li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots">



<h3>Ridgeback Tour 2021 (UK, £850)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="378" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ridgeback-tour-2021-touring-bike.png?resize=580%2C378&#038;ssl=1" alt class="wp-image-19496" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ridgeback-tour-2021-touring-bike.png?resize=1024%2C668&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ridgeback-tour-2021-touring-bike.png?resize=300%2C196&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ridgeback-tour-2021-touring-bike.png?resize=768%2C501&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ridgeback-tour-2021-touring-bike.png?resize=1200%2C782&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ridgeback-tour-2021-touring-bike.png?w=1534&amp;ssl=1 1534w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p><strong>Ridgeback</strong>’s touring bike series has gone from strength to strength in the last few years, with an increasing number of long-distance riders using the Panorama, and a move into 26-inch wheel territory with the Expedition. The <a href="https://www.ridgeback.co.uk/ridgeback-tour-varrb2150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tour</a> is their entry-level offering, and for the price, you’ll find an impressively well-specified aluminium-framed touring bike.</p>



<p>The 3×8sp mountain-bike drivetrain with an Acera rear derailleur and an 11–32t cassette gives the Tour a good range of gear ratios, and the Continental Contact tyres are above average: expect to get a good few thousand miles out of&nbsp;these.</p>



<p>Other plus points include 36-spoke wheels, toe clips, a sturdy rear rack, and a range of 5 frame sizes. Ridgeback are well distributed; it shouldn’t be hard to find a dealer in your&nbsp;area.</p>



<p>If you think you might want to upgrade at a later date, you might also consider the steel-framed <a href="https://www.ridgeback.co.uk/ridgeback-voyage-varrb2151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voyage</a> (RRP £1,100).</p>

<p> Japanese manufacturer <strong>Fuji</strong>’s entry-level touring bike, simply named the <a href="https://www.fujibikes.com/europe/bikes/road/adventure-and-touring/touring-disc/touring-ltd">Touring</a>, features a Reynolds 520 cromoly frameset with classic drop-bar touring geometry. It’s prime for upgrades and additions, with three bottle cage mounts on the frame, and lowrider mounts on the&nbsp;fork.</p>



<p>Strong 36-spoke wheels on Shimano Deore hubs, plus a durable mid-range Shimano MTB 3×9sp groupset and bar-end Microshift shifters, point to high ambitions in a good-value package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Extra touches include LED front and rear lights, toe clips, a choice of two colours, and no fewer than seven frame sizes – particularly interesting for short or tall riders. A <a href="https://www.fujibikes.com/europe/bikes/road/adventure-and-touring/touring-disc/touring-disc-ltd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disc brake-equipped version</a> is available too.</p>

<h3>Pro Tip #1: How To Get A Cheap Touring Bike&nbsp;Even Cheaper</h3>



<p>Whether online or in store, <strong>getting discounts on touring bikes is all about timing</strong>.</p>



<p>New season models start rolling out towards the end of the calendar year, but sales decline at this time too. This is when most stores will start clearing old stock to make space for new season bikes. Discounts are generally around 25–35%, but can be&nbsp;more.</p>



<p>Late spring and summer is peak bike-buying season, making it the worst time to get a good deal on a&nbsp;bike.</p>



<h3>Pro Tip #2: How To Avoid Buying The Wrong&nbsp;Bike</h3>



<p>As I’ve mentioned many times elsewhere, the best way to avoid getting the wrong bike is to <strong>test ride it first</strong>.</p>



<p>You’ll also benefit from getting the bike set up by an expert bike fitter for your unique size, shape and comfort preferences.</p>



<p><a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/touring-bike-faq-6-whats-the-best-way-to-avoid-buying-the-wrong-bike/">Read this article</a> for more on why this is such a critical stage of choosing a bicycle, be it a cheap touring bike from the list above or top-end <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/list-of-expedition-touring-bikes/">expedition bike</a> to take you round the&nbsp;world.</p>



<p>Related to this, if you’re having a hard time choosing between a small number of models on your shortlist, it’s probably because the one to choose will be <strong>the one that feels right when you test-ride it</strong> – and you haven’t test-ridden them&nbsp;yet.</p>



<p><a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/best-touring-bike-retailers-uk/">This list of specialist, UK-based touring bike shops</a> might help&nbsp;here…</p>



<h3>Pro Tip #3: Some Advice On Upgrading Cheap Touring Bikes</h3>



<p>As mentioned earlier, many of these bikes – particularly those with steel frames – are prime for <strong>upgrading</strong> if you decide to make touring a more regular thing, or you have something more adventurous in&nbsp;mind.</p>



<p>Among the best places to start are with the <strong>wheels</strong> (changing the stock wheels for a hand-built pair), the <strong>tyres</strong> (upgrading to a more durable set such as the Marathon Plus or Mondial), and the <strong>racks</strong>&nbsp;(Tubus’ cromoly racks are second to&nbsp;none).</p>



<p>You might also consider getting the basic headset switched out for a more durable cartridge-bearing unit.</p>



<p>Upgrading these parts will make your bike a much more capable long-haul touring machine, as they’re critical structural parts that you’ll want to make as fail-safe as possible.</p>



<p>Drivetrains, pedal bearings, gear and brake cables and the like will wear out, of course, but that’s true of bikes twice the price – and in any case, these are things you can easily replace when you’re on the&nbsp;road.</p>



<p>You might also consider <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/how-to-build-the-ultimate-round-the-world-expedition-touring-bike/">building your own touring bike</a> on a budget.</p>
