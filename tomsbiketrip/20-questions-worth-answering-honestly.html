<h1>20 Questions Worth Answering Honestly (And My Responses)</h1>
<p>Al Humphreys’ <a href="http://www.alastairhumphreys.com/20-questions-worth-answering-honestly-answers/" target="_blank">twenty questions</a>&nbsp;— and I suggest you answer them too — came at just the right moment; when you suddenly find yourself wrestling with time and priorities and wondering if the path you set yourself on is still the right&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>(It’s worth facing an uncomfortable truth or two sometimes. As a more talented writer than me once said, “no legacy is so rich as honesty”…)</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/8046876814/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/8030/8046876814_0917128699.jpg?resize=500%2C333&#038;ssl=1" alt="Janapar world premiere audience" width="500" height="333"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p><strong>1. Do you earn enough money?</strong><br>
No. I currently don’t earn enough to keep a roof over my head and pursue my (inexpensive) interests. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>2. Do you enjoy your&nbsp;job?</strong><br>
Yes. But it’s not yet generating any income. I think of now as the ‘time investment’ period. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>3. Do you prefer Saturday or Monday?</strong><br>
Honestly, I can barely distinguish between the two… <em></em></p>
<p><strong>4. What would you like to be doing one year from now? Can you make that happen?</strong><br>
Processing the aftermath of my next big expedition project. And yes. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>5. What would you like to be doing five years from now? Will you make that happen?</strong><br>
Raising a family (gulp) with the time and impetus it deserves. And yes. But planning five years into the future requires a big leap of faith. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>6. What would you do with your life if you were a billionaire? Is it possible to live a modified version of that life anyway?</strong><br>
I’d employ other people to take over the admin and the stuff I currently botch together myself out of necessity. And I’d be less reluctant to part with cash for rent/food/bills. Otherwise I wouldn’t change anything major. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>7. How much could you cut your outgoings by? How much time at work does that equate to?</strong><br>
I barely spend anything beyond the (really) bare essentials. Reducing it further would mean dumpster-diving, hitching and cycling everywhere, and squatting, which wouldn’t leave time for much&nbsp;else!</p>
<p><strong>8. Do you have enough spare time to do the things you really enjoy? If not, why&nbsp;not?</strong><br>
I do, but often find myself answering emails, working through to-do lists – “putting out fires” – instead of doing them. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>9. What takes up a lot of your time but is neither unavoidable, rewarding nor enjoyable? Why don’t you cut that/them out immediately, or pay somebody to do it for&nbsp;you?</strong><br>
Perfecting things that don’t need to be perfected. Working on it. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>10. What mildly pleasant, but pretty pointless things do you fritter too much time doing? How many times a day do you check your email/Twitter/Facebook? How much TV do you&nbsp;watch?</strong><br>
After email, Google Reader is my biggest time sink. The problem with email is that dealing with it (i.e. replying to it) engenders yet more in return. Twitter/Facebook is minimal, thankfully. And I’ve never owned a&nbsp;TV.</p>
<p><strong>11. What would you like to do more&nbsp;of?</strong><br>
Seeing friends. Unfortunately, most of them are too busy. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>12. What motivates you to do something well?</strong><br>
Personal satisfaction, and the opportunity to learn new crafts and skills and perspectives through the process of making and doing. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>13. Who do you envy, and&nbsp;why?</strong><br>
People who can take photographs like&nbsp;<a href="http://thephotosociety.org/" rel="nofollow">this</a>. People in the field of adventure who earn a comfortable income through it.&nbsp;And…</p>
<blockquote><p>I envy people who are not at all ambitious and are content to pootle around having a pleasant, happy, gentle life. <em></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Can’t do much better than&nbsp;that!</p>
<p><strong>14. If you were 100 and looking back on your life, would you be happy with a life well-lived?</strong><br>
I think I’d be happy with my 20s, for sure. Difficult to go further than that since I’m not yet&nbsp;30!</p>
<p><strong>15. What makes you proud, satisfied, and content?</strong><br>
Seeing my wife happy. Seeing my projects positively affect someone without them knowing I’m watching. Knowing that I’ve overcome a tangible personal barrier. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>16. What makes you frustrated, bored, and unfulfilled?</strong><br>
Reaching the evening with no sense of progress, despite not having left my desk all&nbsp;day.</p>
<p><strong>17. What would you do if you had more talent?</strong><br>
Improvise on the piano. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>18. What would you do if you had more&nbsp;guts?</strong><br>
Stand up and tell my story to a crowd. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>19. What would you do with your life if nobody was watching, judging or commenting?</strong><br>
Write a diary instead of a blog. Travel selfishly instead of wondering how my trips might be communicated. <em></em></p>
<p><strong>20. What are you going to do about all&nbsp;this?</strong><br>
Been working on that since my private New Year’s Resolution to earn a living through my adventures by the end of 2012. I won’t know whether or not this has been successful until the end of the year. But I’m happy with the progress made thus&nbsp;far.</p>
<p><strong>Well, that’s my resolved existential conundrums for the month! Dare you copy-paste <a href="http://www.alastairhumphreys.com/questions-worth-asking/" target="_blank">Al’s questions</a> into the comments here and answer them yourself?</strong></p>
