<h1>The 21 Best UK Bike Shops For Cycle Touring &amp; Bikepacking Gear In&nbsp;2020</h1>

<p><em>Last updated in August 2020, adding two new shops to the&nbsp;list.</em></p>



<p>There are a lot of bike shops selling touring bikes and bikepacking gear. There are far fewer who are <em>specialised</em> in these niches.</p>



<p>This is hardly surprising. Cycle touring is a tiny market. Bikepacking has quickly become fashionable, but there’s still far more money to be made flogging overpriced road racers and mountain bikes to MAMILs. For most UK bike shops, sticking a medium-sized Dawes Galaxy in a corner somewhere is usually considered enough to then claim to ‘sell touring bikes’.</p>



<p><strong>But a few brave shop owners have made a name for themselves as true cycle touring and bikepacking specialists.</strong></p>



<p>The owners of these workshops and showrooms all tend to have one thing in common: they are (or were) cycle tourists and bikepackers themselves. As a result, they&nbsp;know exactly what a cycle tourist or bikepacking enthusiast needs – better than any big-name shop assistant ever&nbsp;will.</p>



<p>They are also some of the few places you’ll be able to test-ride a range of bikes to see which one fits your needs, rather than just the one aforementioned medium-sized Dawes Galaxy.</p>



<p><strong>They are, in short, an indispensable friend to the touring cyclist or bikepacker, especially when you’re just getting started.</strong></p>



<p>Here, then, is a list of bike shops the full length the UK who partly or wholly specialise in touring bikes, bikepacking gear, and associated equipment and accessories. They’re listed in alphabetical order, with full contact details. It’s likely that you’ve never heard of most of&nbsp;them.</p>



<p>As for which shop is ‘best’, the truest answer I can give you is <em>whichever one is closest to you</em>.&nbsp;I’ve said it many times before: there’s <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/touring-bike-faq-6-whats-the-best-way-to-avoid-buying-the-wrong-bike/">no substitute for test-riding a bike before you buy it</a>.</p>



<p>On with the&nbsp;list!</p>
