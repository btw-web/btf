<h1>Armenia and Global Issues</h1>
<p>Last night I revisited the venue in Yerevan where Andy and I gave a presentation back in February. Common Ground is the project of a local NGO to provide an open forum for interested people from all backgrounds to discuss today’s issues and attend presentations in English. The organiser, an Armenian woman who grew up in Manchester, England, introduced the event for this evening — a showing of Al Gore’s Oscar-winning documentary, <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.climatecrisis.net/"><em>An Inconvenient Truth</em></span>.<!--more--></p>
<p>However many awards it did or did not win, I think this might just be one of the most important films ever made. If you’re living in the England and you haven’t seen it, you might be surprised to hear that to view this film is now a formal part of our children’s education. I learnt only yesterday that a copy of the film had been distributed to every state-run school in the country. If you are a parent, and you haven’t seen it, maybe you should, so you know what your children are talking about when they come home talking about it, and so you don’t regret in the future what you are doing&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>Though I’d seen it before, I really wanted Tenny to see the film. I was interested to see what she thought of the issue which Gore has dedicated the last 30 years to propounding — global warming. It’s a frightening film. If you aren’t frightened by it, you probably don’t understand it. This is not a film that you sit around and talk about afterwards in the usual way (“The cinematography was nice…” “I really liked the music…”). This is a film that will lead to a lot of extremely serious discussions about the topic at hand, not the film-making itself. Most importantly, this film represents the best chance most people will have to understand the problems facing the world today, and to say “Yes, I can do something!”</p>
<p>After viewing the film, the 15 or 20 people in the small conference centre sat and discussed the issue. “You know, the most important thing is that people should learn to live basically,” whispered Tenny to me. I thought she had a very good point. Previously in these blogs, I’ve made the observation that it has been the people who live basic, rural lives, and have what they need to live simply — but, importantly, don’t suffer from the eternal desire for more — who have been the happiest, most welcoming, and most generous with what they <em>do</em> have.</p>
<p>In reality, the Western world (which is largely to blame for the present-day CO2 levels) would have a hard time reverting to a subsistence-level existence. And I think that most people’s biggest fear is that their relatively comfortable, stable lives would be turned upside down. This is simply not the case! Most people would be able to reduce their personal contribution to the global problem — and we all contribute — by making a few small changes to the way they live. And you can read about these changes <a href="http://wwf.panda.org/how_you_can_help/">right here at the WWF’s One Planet Living website</a>, designed specifically to help you make these changes as easily as possible. Believe me, after seeing An Inconvenient Truth, you’ll be glad that resources like this are already out&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>On the way home, I talked with Tenny about everything that this journey represented to me regarding this immense global issue. Most people won’t be looking to reduce their carbon footprint quite as close to zero as I have done by choosing my current lifestyle of bike travel and bare-necessesities living. More realistic for the developed countries would be something like <a href="http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?121361/WWF-Abu-Dhabi-unveil-plans-for-sustainable-city">Masdar City</a>, soon to be the world’s greenest city, being built by the government of the Arab Emirate of Abu Dhabi, a tiny pocket of affluence in the Arabian Peninsular. In the UK, <a href="http://www.bioregional.com/">BioRegional</a> and the <a href="http://www.wwf.org.uk/">WWF</a> are working on similar projects to demonstrate exactly how the developed world can operate in the future if global warming prevention measures are taken on board&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>So don’t be afraid to rent <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.climatecrisis.net/"><em>An Inconvenient Truth</em></span> next time you go to the movie store. Better still, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inconvenient-Truth-Al-Gore/dp/B000IU4DO6/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1207921330&amp;sr=8-1">buy a copy</a> (all of £5 from Amazon) and show it to everyone you know. I have a copy of my own which I am taking with me on my future travels to show to all those who I can convince to watch it. It’s not often that something like this comes along, when a serious worldwide issue is presented in such an accessible, even enjoyable way. You’ll finish watching it, feeling great that you can be part of the solution to the greatest threat that the human species has faced, since… well,&nbsp;ever.</p>
