<h1>Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XLite Ultralight Camping Mat: Long-Term Review</h1>

<p><em>Disclosure: In 2012 Therm-a-Rest sent me a free review unit of their then-new ultralight camping mattresses, the NeoAir XLite, in exchange for long-term testing and feedback. I wrote this review in 2013 after a year of use and then gifted the mat to a rider in greater need. I’ve kept the review current regarding specifications, prices and suppliers, last updating it in June&nbsp;2020.</em></p>

<p>At first glance, the <a class="thirstylink affiliatelink" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite" href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/recommends/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite/" data-shortcode="true">Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite</a> is an astonishingly advanced piece of ultralight kit.</p>



<p>When packed, this camping mat can squeeze into the side pocket of my trousers. It weighs the same as an average cycling water bottle – of which half has already been drank. Inflated, it provides almost as much loft as the <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/exped-downmat-7-pump-camping-mattress-review-for-cycle-touring/">Exped Downmat 7</a>. Never until its launch in 2012 was this combination of packability and comfort available in a sleeping pad. On paper, at&nbsp;least.</p>



<p>There are, of course, many other detailed considerations to take into account when choosing a sleeping pad like this for a long-haul ride. Here, then, is my detailed review of what Therm-a-Rest promised would be the last ultralight camping mattress I’d ever&nbsp;need…</p>



<h3>What kind of cycle tour or bikepacking trip is the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite best&nbsp;for?</h3>



<p>This mattress was conceived for those who want to ultra-lighten their loads, still be able to sleep comfortably, and retain the assurance of quality associated with the Therm-a-Rest brand. It’s <em>ridiculously</em> small when packed.</p>



<p>One reviewer called it “the lightest comfortable sleeping pad in existence”, and that’s really the only way to describe it. The Klymit Inertia X Frame, for example, is significantly lighter than the NeoAir XLite, but if you’re not 5 foot 10 tall and you don’t sleep on your back, you wouldn’t describe it as comfortable.</p>



<p><em>(Update: lighter ‘comfortable’ mats have since been released – most notably the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thermarest.com/sleeping-pads/fast-and-light/neoair-uberlite-sleeping-pad/neoair-uberlite.html" target="_blank">UberLite</a>, also from Therm-a-Rest – but there are diminishing returns as weight ratings drop ever closer to&nbsp;zero.)</em></p>



<p>The NeoAir XLite is available in four size options. The one I’ll be reviewing here is the ‘regular’ version, full-length but slightly narrower than an average mattress and tapered towards the feet. It weighs in at 340g (12 oz), packs down to 23×10×10cm (9×4×4in), and can be squashed even smaller when stowed with the valve open. There’s also a three-quarter-length ‘small’ version for ultra-minimalists, a long model, a wide model, and a womens’ version with more insulation.</p>



<p>If you’re running a standard long-distance touring luggage setup with four panniers and a bar-bag, the extra bulk of a more traditional mattress is unlikely to be an issue, and so the benefits of the NeoAir XLite’s packability might not be obvious.</p>



<p>But what if you could pack everything for the long-haul into two panniers alone?</p>



<p>This is what I tried for a two-month trip down the U.S. West Coast last year. Along with a 1‑man tent and other kit minimalisations, I found the two-pannier setup liberating (particularly after that time I hauled a trailer across <a title="Video: Mongolia By Mountain Bike - Part One" href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/mongolia-by-mountain-bike-part-one/">Mongolia</a>), and would have happily extended those two months indefinitely with no major changes of&nbsp;kit.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-flickr wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-flickr"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/7262745322/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/7218/7262745322_90604c9053.jpg?resize=500%2C332&#038;ssl=1" alt="MSR Hubba with fly" width="500" height="332"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a>
</div></figure>



<p>I also took the XLite trekking in Iran in the spring of 2013, when size and weight had a much more immediate impact on my pack. Its comfort was already assured; I was interested in putting its longevity and flexibility to the&nbsp;test.</p>



<p>So if you’re leaning towards the ‘less is more’ camp, the NeoAir XLite might be a good match. This speaks particularly to bikepackers, <a title="Folding touring with the Tern Link P24h: Possible? Practical? Really?" href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/folding-touring-with-the-tern-link-p24h-possible-practical-really/">folding tourers</a>, and short-term road riders planning to camp but also to pare luggage down to a minimum.</p>



<h3>Comfort</h3>



<p>The only meaningful measure of any sleeping pad, of course, is whether or not you can actually get a decent night’s sleep on&nbsp;it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having used a variety of camping mats over the years, from the closed cell foam Multimat I began with to the utterly luxuriant <a title="Exped DownMat 7 Pump Camping Mattress Review For Cycle Touring" href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/exped-downmat-7-pump-camping-mattress-review-for-cycle-touring/">Downmat</a> that kept me warm at 30 below in the Arctic, I’m happy (and surprised) to report that the XLite — despite its packed size — really does deliver on this&nbsp;front.</p>



<p>Inflated, it’s 6.3cm thick. It’s important to note that the thickness of a mattress affects more than just comfort and insulation; it also factors into your choice of campsite, as a thicker mat can absorb rougher ground whilst still providing a comfortable sleeping surface. It’s possible to deflate the mat slighty to suit your preferred level of cushioning, though this will make it noisier (one of the mat’s few negatives; see&nbsp;below).</p>



<p>For someone of average build, the 20 inches of width are more than sufficient. There’s a wider version if you need it. I chose the ‘regular’ width so I’d have a little space for belongings when I paired it with the <a title="MSR Hubba 1P Solo Tent - Owner Review" href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/msr-hubba-1-man-solo-cycle-touring-backpacking-tent-owner-review/">MSR Hubba 1P tent</a>.</p>

</div></figure>



<h3>Build Quality &amp; Durability</h3>



<p>With all ultralight gear, it’s important to regulate your expectations of longevity, as the materials used are intrinsically less durable.</p>



<p>I owned this mat for a year before writing this review, using it not only on a daily basis for two 2‑month trips (cycling and trekking) but also on every shorter trip in between, and experienced no problems. In the same amount of time, however, I did find a few reports of durability issues online. These seemed to be related to issues with early versions of the mat; particularly with condensation build-up as a result of oral inflation.</p>



<p>Therm-a-Rest have updated the design based on early feedback, including adding an optional inflation sack to help remedy moisture-related issues. Judging from more recent reviews, it now looks like the NeoAir XLite really is built to&nbsp;last.</p>



<h3>Problems</h3>



<p>The biggest issue (more of a niggle) with the NeoAir XLite is how noisy it can be. The nylon used in the construction sounds like a paper bag being screwed up whenever you turn over or – god forbid – attempt to kneel on the thing. This is exaggerated all the more if you let some air out to adjust the level of cushioning.</p>



<p>While this is hardly a deal-breaker, it’s worth being aware of, particularly if you’ve pitched up in a campground close to a tent full of extremely sensitive and angry people.</p>



<p>As mentioned briefly earlier on, the only other issue I encountered was that condensation seems to accumulate inside the mat under certain circumstances (inflating it with warm moist breath in cold weather). I know of at least one user whose mat began to grow mould after being stored long-term in this&nbsp;state.</p>



<p>The easiest solution is to air the mattress for a couple of days before storing it, hanging it up in a warm, dry place with the valve open and at the top (this is probably good advice for all orally-inflated mattresses). Another solution would be to use the optional inflation bag rather than inflating it by&nbsp;mouth.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>



<p>I chose the <a class="thirstylink affiliatelink" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite" href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/recommends/therm-a-rest-neoair-xlite/" data-shortcode="true">Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite</a> so that I could tour really lightweight, picking other camping gear to match. Thanks to its ridiculously small packed size, my sleeping bag and mattress together occupied nothing more than the bottom of a single pannier, making its durability all the more impressive. Highly recommended – as long as you can live with the&nbsp;noise!</p>
