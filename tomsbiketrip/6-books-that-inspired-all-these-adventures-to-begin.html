<h1>6 Books That Inspired All These Adventures To&nbsp;Begin</h1>
<p>Adventuring never came naturally to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>When I was younger, to say that I was untalented at sports would be a kind understatement. I never went camping because of the one time my parents tried it and it rained. I wasn’t allowed to join the Scouts because of paedophiles. As a student I joined the TA to make up for it but failed to see out the first year. My list of potential career paths has included computer programmer, disc jockey, hotel manager, lighting designer, barista, ski guide, yardie, carpenter, pot-washer and shit-shoveller — but nothing resembling ‘adventurer’.</p>
<p>(Perhaps it was this unenviable list of prospective futures that I was trying to escape?)</p>
<p>Yet, somewhere along the line, a few seeds were sown that seem to have germinated into the only thing I’ve ever been able to call a career. Being someone who reads for escapism, I believe that most of those seeds were sown by books. Here are some of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Note that these are not necessarily ‘good’ books. I don’t suggest anyone buy them in anticipation of planning their own adventures. It’s just a collection of the books that I happened to read — long before I knew that ‘cycle touring’ existed as an actual thing.</span></p>

For whatever reason, this is the one that stands out most clearly. I might conveniently romanticise history by suggesting that they inspired a spirit of healthy curiosity towards the unknown.</p>

Flicking through the little pages of advice on surviving mortally dangerous situations never failed to implant dreams of macho heroics (and corresponding success with women) into the minds of two teenage boys. Probably responsible for the presence of brass rabbit snares in my original kit-list for a cycling trip.</p>

The bottom shelf of the travel section. It was from this book that I first learned that cycling across whole countries had actually already been done, and that at the age of 23 I wasn’t the first person to have the idea. So mind-blowing was the discovery that I ended up taking a Stanley knife to it and packing the middle third of the book in my panniers as inspiration for when the going got tough. (The author later told me that this was ridiculous.)</p>

The co-authored narrative was flawed, but the sentiment of the trip was a tipping point.</p>

One decides that one continent, one and a half oceans and a ruined friendship is quite enough, thanks, and writes this book. (The other, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B008S1YPH2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B008S1YPH2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ridear-21" target="_blank">Jason Lewis</a>, continues for another decade or so and completes the project alone.) A highly memorable book that showed me what kind of a trip I <em>didn’t</em> want to&nbsp;do.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007WTG41G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B007WTG41G&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ridear-21" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-5837 img-thumbnail" style="margin-left: 15px;" alt="moods-of-future-joys" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/moods-of-future-joys-150x150.jpg?resize=150%2C150" width="150" height="150"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a>No list of books that inspired a big bike ride would be complete without Alastair’s colourful modern-day classic; the tale of a young middle-class Brit with nothing better to do and a penchant for setting ludicrous goals to entertain himself — such as cycling the length of all the world’s major landmasses. I came across this excellently-written book about half-way through the planning of my own Big Trip, and it prompted a serious increase in anticipated mileage and a prolonged feeling of inferiority for failing to ever reach&nbsp;it.</p>
<p style="clear: both;"># # #</p>
<p>Whenever I’m concerned that Internet-age information overload is in danger of clouding my decisions and unhelpfully influencing my current direction, I find it helps to look back and consider <em>why</em> I followed the road that let to here. It’s a good reminder of the priorities that make these journeys my own, rather than imitations of somebody else’s.</p>
