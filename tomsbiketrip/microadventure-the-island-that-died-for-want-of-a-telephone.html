<h1>Microadventure: “The island that died for want of a telephone”</h1>
<p>It was a promisingly sunny afternoon as we dashed down the quayside in Cleggan and threw our bags aboard the ferry for Inishbofin. After a yawnsome four-hour drive from Dublin, this sudden burst of excitement and panic ensured we would keep our appointment with Dermot by a hair’s breadth.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the ferry safely in port and another gaggle of American tourists off to roam the island for the afternoon, Dermot beckoned us down a slippery flight of stairs to the water’s edge where a small powerboat was tied up. No sooner had we arrived at Inishbofin, a few miles offshore from County Galway, than it was receding into the distance again, and after a few minutes of darting between rocky outcrops and tiny green isles of sheep and gulls we were soon drifting up alongside an eerie, crumbling wharf.</p>
<p>This was the island we’d come way out west to visit; an all-but-forgotten victim of bureaucracy and bad weather called Inishshark.</p>

<p>It is almost&nbsp;inconceivable&nbsp;to me, as a landlubber from the English Midlands, that there are places in the British Isles so utterly desolate and remote as this island seemed to be. Ever since I began to travel and learned how absurdly limited my knowledge of the world actually was, I have been yearning to explore more deeply the lands surrounding the place I once called home. I’ve made a concerted effort to do so during my occasional stays at this end of Europe, but it seems I still haven’t lost the capacity to be shocked.</p>
<p>Inishshark’s story is purportedly one of human tragedy, and one wanders the square kilometre of squelchy meadow, hillside and slate with the shells of houses and half-collapsed walls as an ever-present reminder. The last remaining residents were evacuated in 1960, when the Irish government deemed it too expensive to provide services such as telephone lines, electricity and a functional harbour to the islanders. It was an event that would nowadays be downplayed as “a regrettable but necessary decision made for the greater good” by a soulless spokesperson on telly. But this was 1960’s Ireland, and it’s likely that just as few heard of the island’s plight at the time as are aware of it&nbsp;today.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/Re_Ferg" target="_blank">Fearghal</a> and I spent a day and a night wandering in the drizzle, experimenting with some new camera gear and putting the world to rights by a driftwood campfire. I bemoaned not bringing my packraft and not being able to paddle over under our own steam. Chartering a local boat and its owner felt like a bit of a&nbsp;cheat.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/7508018394/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/8008/7508018394_ffab1a4075.jpg?resize=500%2C329&#038;ssl=1" alt="Return to society" width="500" height="329"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>But I suppose it would be little but a romantic notion to paddle over here — just like the notion of spending one’s life on a tiny weather-battered rock in the ocean. It’d be too easy for me to cast the island’s story as a tragedy, because I had the indelible privilege and certainty of going back home. Maybe those last twenty-three were crying out to leave that god-forsaken island of sheep, seals and seagulls. In their shoes, I’m sure I’d have done just&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Hands up if you spotted the dessicated cow’s head in the photos.</p>
<p><strong>I suggested this island on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alastairhumphreys.com/favourite-wild-places-britain/" target="_blank">Alastair Humphreys’ list of favourite wild places</a>, but he soon pointed out that his list was for Britain, rather than the British Isles. (It’s still a nice list, though.)</strong><span id="pty_trigger"></span></p>
