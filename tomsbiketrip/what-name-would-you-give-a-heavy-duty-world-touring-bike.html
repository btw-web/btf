<h1>What Name Would You Give A Heavy-Duty World Touring Bike?</h1>
<p>After last week’s rather <a title="Something’s Happening In The World Of Adventure. And I’m Not Sure I Like&nbsp;It" href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/somethings-happening-in-the-world-of-adventure-and-im-not-sure-i-like-it/">vocal debate</a> on the ethics of commercialism in adventure, I figured it was time to get firmly back to what we all love: travelling the world on two wheels. (Less talk, more action, and all&nbsp;that.)</p>
<p>Now, as long-term&nbsp;readers will know, I’ve never had any particular fascination with touring bikes themselves. Though I’ve written the odd <a title="What’s The Best Touring Bike?" href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/which-touring-bike-should-i-buy/">blog post</a> on the topic, this has mainly been in order to get&nbsp;people here via&nbsp;search engines so that I can talk to them about how getting on a bike and going somewhere&nbsp;is a far better use of their time than endlessly googling touring bikes. (This works pretty well.)</p>
<p>But in the years since I started this blog,&nbsp;I’ve inevitably&nbsp;accumulating a certain amount of wisdom — both from first hand experience on the road in 40+ countries and from literally hundreds of other equally experienced riders — on what it is that distinguishes the ‘ideal’ world travel bicycle from… not just other bikes in general, but other <em>touring</em> bikes too. For not all touring bikes are created equal. Not by a long&nbsp;shot.</p>
<p>(Ironically, my&nbsp;lack of interest in equipment&nbsp;led me to write an <a href="http://gearforcycletouring.com/" target="_blank">entire handbook</a> on choosing gear for cycle touring — the theory&nbsp;being, of course, that by doing so I would never have to answer another question on cycle touring equipment ever again. This has largely&nbsp;worked.)</p>
<p>Since relocating to Bristol earlier this year, I’ve also discovered something else, which is that I <em>actually really enjoy working on bicycles</em>. I enjoy getting my hands dirty. I enjoy the process of taking something that’s falling to pieces and — with just my hands and a selection of basic tools and parts — intuit and experiment with&nbsp;how to bring it back to that state of mechanical equilibrium in which everything just&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>It’s also slightly reminiscent of long-term touring. Everyone who’s done such a tour will know of the evolving mental to-do list of bicycle maintenance jobs. The rear&nbsp;derailleur could do with&nbsp;a&nbsp;tweak on the second sprocket down. There’s too much slack in that&nbsp;barrel adjuster. What’s that tick on the drive-side downstroke — pedal bearing, chainring bolt, bottom bracket or loose shoelace? Without wanting to get too <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0063HC7EQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0063HC7EQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ridear-21&amp;linkId=23WC3OB6CSDHZULT" target="_blank">Pirsig</a>, there’s a certain zen to the art of bicycle maintenance.</p>
<p>I’ve rediscovered the simple yet therapeutic nature of bicycle rebuilding&nbsp;by volunteering at the <a href="http://www.thebristolbikeproject.org/" target="_blank">Bristol Bike Project</a>, spending one afternoon a&nbsp;week taking donated rust-heaps that’ve been sitting in people’s garden sheds for god knows how long and making them roadworthy again. These bicycles are often museum pieces. Not a day goes by at the Bike Project when I don’t learn something new about some long-forgotten piece of bicycle engineering technology.</p>
<p>Anyway. It got me thinking: if I were to build another bicycle from the ground up for the specific intention of travelling the planet, ultra long term, wanting insane levels of durability, maximum versatility in where I could take it, ultimate ease of maintenance, the greatest possible chance of finding compatible parts, and with comfort under load as a top priority… what would such a bike look like? What parts would I choose? What would my priorities be for the build, with all that experience to draw from? And how would it be put together?</p>
<p>It would certainly differ greatly from my <a title="How To: Build The Perfect Expedition Bike (Part&nbsp;1)" href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/how-to-build-the-perfect-expedition-bike-part-1/">first attempt at building an expedition bike</a>. While certainly unique, that bike only really came into its own in Outer Mongolia and the most challenging&nbsp;parts of Africa. It was massively overbuilt for long-distance touring, slowed me down immeasurably, and in retrospect was a bit like taking a sledgehammer to a picturehook. It got me where I was going, of course. But there’s a lot I’d want to change.</p>
<p><strong>Well, I’m excited to announce that I have now designed and built such a&nbsp;bike.</strong></p>

<p>While the chances of me attempting to cycle round the world in one go (again) are slim, being happily married and having otherwise got it out of my system, this bike is the one I’d like to think I’ll spend the remainder of my touring days riding, wherever in the world I choose&nbsp;to go.</p>
<p>Vast amounts of thought and research have gone into its design, and I’ll be sharing the complete build process on this blog in the next couple of&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p><strong>But for now, I could use some help. Because the bike still doesn’t have a&nbsp;name.</strong></p>
<p>So here’s the point of today’s post:</p>
<p><strong>If you were building the ultimate heavy-duty world touring bicycle, what name would you give&nbsp;it?</strong></p>
<p>(Ideally, something other than ‘Tom’s Expedition Bike’ — though that is a fairly accurate description!)</p>
<p>Answers in the comments. Whoever comes up with the name I choose gets a mystery prize. Just for&nbsp;fun&nbsp;🙂</p>
<p>To get your creative juices flowing, here are some of the suggestions that have come through on Twitter and Facebook so&nbsp;far:</p>
