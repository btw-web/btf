<h1>The ups and downs had depended far more on attitude than altitude</h1>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Tell you what,’ said the red-haired girl behind the bar, ‘I’ll give you these three on the house. And then the rest … well, you can decide for yourselves.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Wow!’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Thank you!’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We were perched upon barstools, Andy to my left, Mark to my right. Thick dark liquid began sliding into the second glass, tilted expertly to allow a steady build-up of foam atop the beer. The result looked like a pint of Guinness in an oversize wine glass: we were about to take our first sip of the famous Belgian Trappist ale.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Mmm … that’s delicious!’ Andy took a sip from the first glass; a golden brew with a warm sweetness and a touch of&nbsp;fizz.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘You like ale, yes?’ the lady asked Mark, putting the second glass in front of&nbsp;me.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Yes!’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘OK – wait.’ She paused, raising a finger. ‘I have something special for you.’ She turned and headed purposefully in the direction of the fridges at the back of the&nbsp;bar.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘She’s going to open the vault!’ joked Mark as she rummaged amongst clinking bottles and returned with a dusty-looking specimen.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘This,’ she announced, parading the label in front of us, ‘is really one of the strongest. You see,’ – she pointed out the wording – ‘this one is a “double”. There’s a “triple” here, too. It’s, like … seven percent.’ And she reached for the bottle-opener.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I raised my glass victoriously: another long day of riding into stiff winds had been conquered, and country number three had rewarded us with friendly people and a place to sleep, as well as the most welcome free beers ever dispensed! We toasted to the day: to the simple joy of celebrating the end of a hard slog with a couple of good&nbsp;mates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Andy grinned. ‘Why bother eating when you can drink&nbsp;beer?!’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We hadn’t even seen a signpost to announce our arrival into Belgium, another small step in our mission to cycle the globe. Lost in the early-evening drizzle and with nowhere to sleep, we’d flagged down a trundling motorist and asked sheepishly if he had any idea where we might spend the night. The elderly man had shrugged off decades in an instant, hopping back into the driver’s seat as if finding accommodation for three foreign cyclists were his very <i>raison d’être</i>. And so, having desperately chased the born-again boy racer through the suburbs of Maastricht, we’d arrived at a countryside park visitors’ centre where the kindly manager, on hearing of our quest, had set us up on a patch of grass outside the kitchen door – and was now treating us to a well-earned drink.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mark took a small sip, replaced the glass on the bar counter, closed his eyes, clasped his hands on top of his head and leaned back. A smile widened into a laugh. Perhaps it was the hunger and the tiredness of a full day on the road. Or perhaps it was that Belgian monks really did brew the world’s finest ale.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘I’m going to order some food,’ he said shortly, opening his eyes. ‘Anyone care to join me on&nbsp;that?’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I looked at Andy, who was sat to my left in his matching sponsored T‑shirt. ‘What do you reckon?’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Erm … we could have a look at the menu?’ he&nbsp;said.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Mmm,’ I mused. ‘Depends on the price, really.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mark passed over the menu. It was filled with descriptions of food that made my salivary glands ache. But giving in to temptation would set a precedent – one which could easily leak funds away and sabotage our carefully planned budget, which was to spend as little as physically possible.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Basically,’ I said, unable to look up from the menu, ‘I really can’t afford to do this while I’ve got perfectly good food in my panniers.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘I’m sure we could afford this kind of thing occasionally?’ suggested Andy. Mark sat quietly, admiring his glass of&nbsp;beer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Well, go for it, then,’ I replied, closing the menu and putting it back on the bar. ‘But I reckon I’m going to cook something back at the&nbsp;tents.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Right … so what about the food budget? I mean, we’ve all paid for <i>that</i> food, too,’ said&nbsp;Andy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘I dunno, mate. But I can’t afford to splash out every time Mark wants to eat in a restaurant.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Andy had brought up a difficult point, which was that we’d pooled our cash to cover our basic costs. This had been averaging just under five euros a day for each of us, which had required dedication and effort to stick to. We’d been sleeping rough since Amsterdam, picnicking daily on supermarket groceries and boiling up variations on the theme of ‘pasta with sauce’ in the evenings. But if I cooked and ate alone from this shared food store, I’d be eating a meal that the others had subsidised. And if Mark used the shared money to buy a restaurant meal for himself, then we’d be subsiding <i>that</i>. Unless we stuck to a regime, attempting to share our cash would cause more problems than it solved. And each of us feeding ourselves alone would take three times as long, and put the group dynamic strangely off-balance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Well – what are we supposed to do, then?’ I asked, half-rhetorically. The others were silent. This was frustrating. Andy was clearly quite happy to shell out for a home-cooked lasagne. Or a massive burger. Or a juicy steak. Or a delicious pizza. Or a big bowl of&nbsp;soup.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Look, guys,’ sighed Mark. ‘I’m going to eat here. I’m not on as much of a budget as you two. So I can happily afford a blow-out meal every now and them. If you want to go back to the tents and eat what’s there, that’s cool … I’m quite happy sitting here. I’ve got my&nbsp;book&nbsp;…’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Right, well I’ll eat with Tom, then,’ sighed Andy. ‘But I want to finish my beer&nbsp;first.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Yeah … of course! I honestly don’t –’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Fine, OK,’ I interrupted. ‘Well, I’m going to start cooking before I get too pissed to walk straight!’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘See you in a minute, then,’ said Andy, watching me as I got&nbsp;up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Since I couldn’t remember how to get round to the bikes, I took a shortcut through the kitchen where Mark’s dinner was being prepared. Stepping out into the failing dusk and hunting amongst the bags, I discovered that our gas stove was buried at the bottom of Mark’s giant cargo sack. Finally, after arranging all of the ingredients and cooking apparatus in a neat little circle, I sat down by the light of my head-torch to open a tin of tuna and realised that we’d brought along one of those multi-purpose penknives with a built-in can-opener, yet I hadn’t the foggiest idea how to use&nbsp;it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We grew stronger as summer matured. It was a tangible, measurable feeling of strength; a growing confidence in the capability of our bodies to handle hours of exercise every day. Our regime, and that of every other cycle tourist on the road, would have had personal trainers the world over up in arms, bemoaning the complete absence of recovery time, of stretching routines, of cross-training, of good nutrition, and all the other things that the exercise industry proclaims to be right and proper. Instead, we were hacking our bodies, bludgeoning them into performing the task at hand, learning the effect of calories eaten upon energy levels, the relationship between hydration and general wellbeing, exertion and rest, clothing and climate; things which could not be taught but which gradually came to be understood through observing the effects of our experiments upon our bodies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Belgium morphed into France, and a happy routine emerged of long mornings in the saddle, games of ‘who’s got the biggest baguette’ at lunchtime, two-hour siestas in the sun, and relaxed afternoons among the charms of rural Alsace-Lorraine, where the French land still retained hints of its German past, memorials littering the hills and valleys as a reminder of how that particular disagreement had been resolved. Only the frequent appearance of rain threatened to dampen our spirits, and these hours were whiled away in village <i>lavoirs</i> – ancient stone bath-houses – where Andy experimented with the camera he’d bought for the journey, I filled jars with jam I’d cooked from scavenged fruit, and Mark practised his juggling routines.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Basically, I wanted to ride to Spain, and then Gibraltar,’ Mark was explaining into the video camera, ‘because – er – I’d been to Greece in the past, and I wanted to go somewhere that was also similarly sandy and beautiful, and find lonely mountain retreats, and&nbsp;fish.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We’d been on the road for three weeks, reaching the alpine foothills of the Jura in eastern France. Spain, it had to be said, still felt a long way&nbsp;off.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘But the last couple of weeks, we’ve just been meeting loads of really interesting people from different walks of life,’ he continued as I thrust the camera in his face. Like all of us, he was still uncomfortable before the lens. Thoughts which would be freely expressed amongst friends flattened out into dry exposition as soon as a camera was introduced. We’d never realised what a challenge this would be: presenting ourselves and our journey as we would like them to appear to an anonymous audience.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘And I think that if we … head east,’ continued Mark, trying hard to loosen up, ‘we’re more likely to go to a number of different countries that I know nothing about – I’ll know nothing about the people, their way of life, or what they eat. And there’ll be more of an opportunity to find out about the&nbsp;world.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The delivery was stilted, but the idea itself was interesting. Heading east, as Mark had indicated, would be a radical change of tack, and in my mind’s eye I saw weeks of route-planning disappearing into thin air. I expected to feel a pang of regret. Instead, it was almost a liberation to watch the hard-line itinerary dissolving away.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We hadn’t been able to follow the plan closely, anyway. On several occasions we’d attempted to head off-road through the hills – attempts that had invariably ended in failure. One particular afternoon, the two stronger bikers had bitten into a particularly rough climb with gusto, leaving me to drag my bike up the track on foot. Fuming about having been left behind, I’d found them waiting for me about ten minutes’ walk up the&nbsp;trail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘This is completely and utterly pointless!’ I shouted from a distance, feeling a nice big argument coming on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘We’re here now, aren’t we?’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Well, I can’t ride. I’m going&nbsp;back.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘What the&nbsp;hell?’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘If you hadn’t buggered off I’d have told you that ten minutes ago!’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘This was your idea, Tom!’ shouted Andy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘What do you mean, <i>my</i> idea?’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Well, <i>I</i> never decided to turn off that road and follow these blue triangles!’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘I thought you didn’t know the&nbsp;route!’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘I did know the route! It carried on along that road back&nbsp;there!’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Erm … so what do we want to do … ?’ enquired Mark, trying to bring some diplomacy to the exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘If we’re supposed to be on the road,’ I continued, ignoring him, ‘then why the hell aren’t we on the&nbsp;road?’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Because you said, “Follow the blue triangles!”’ shouted Andy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘No, I said that the <i>tourist office</i> said that the mountain-biking routes were marked with blue triangles!’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Fucking hell! What a dick!’ muttered Andy, loud enough for me to hear it, wheeling his bike round to face me. ‘So why did we suddenly start following them?!?’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Because there was no-one telling me that there was any other bloody route to go!’ I&nbsp;raged.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Well, we don’t normally just <i>randomly</i> turn off the road onto a track, do we? Why put a random route into the equation?’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘<i>Because nobody said we were going any other way!!!</i>’</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was the kind of verbal brawl that felt immediately pointless. Andy and I found ourselves sheepishly apologising to each other on the roadside. It wasn’t the first time; nor would it be the last. But through discovering the limits of our off-road abilities, we’d found that it was possible to travel more quickly – and to meet more interesting people – by stitching together a new route on minor roads and cycleways. Given that, maybe a change of tack wasn’t such a bad&nbsp;idea.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I wandered over to Andy, who’d been listening to Mark’s monologue into the video camera, sitting in the sun on some wooden steps that led up the hillside.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘I’ve been wanting to head east most of the time anyway!’ he said, flashing a wry grin in Mark’s direction. He’d been suggesting this since Amsterdam, and now, I grudgingly conceded, it seemed that he might have been right all along. Heading east now would lift all the pressure of having to circumnavigate Spain and be back in Central Europe before autumn. It would mean that we really could relax into the journey instead of feeling constantly in debt to this big detour we’d promised to&nbsp;make.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘I wasn’t going to get in anyone’s face,’ insisted Mark. ‘I’m not really like that! I’m a pretty flexible soul&nbsp;…’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘I was hoping Mark was going to go to Spain, though, because he’s starting to annoy me,’ smirked Andy into the camera.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mark looked on with obvious amusement. ‘You two would die without me! You’d be fighting the first&nbsp;night!’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Which was almost definitely true.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The decision had been unexpectedly amicable. It was probably the encounters of the previous weeks that had made notions of route and direction seem less of a concern. The ups and downs had depended far more on attitude than altitude. Gibraltar, then, was off the map, and a new target drifted into view: <i>Istanbul</i>. Though always part of the plan, it sounded so foreign, now; so impossibly far&nbsp;away.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mark hefted his bike upright and began to pedal slowly up the long incline. Andy was already disappearing out of sight behind the shoulder of the hill. Tomorrow, then, we would pass into Switzerland and begin to pedal east. I would contact my friends near Geneva and let them know that we’d be dropping by rather earlier than originally planned.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Billowing grey clouds were forming intricate landscapes of their own above the valleys of the Jura, hinting at the nearing of the Alps. The ground where we’d rested was cast into shade, the western horizon growing orange and brooding in the late afternoon, a band of pure colour cutting across the sky. Amid darkening lands a few wooded hilltops still glowed, touched by shafts of illuminating sunlight – too far away to make them out in detail, yet carrying some strange hint of promise.</span></p>
