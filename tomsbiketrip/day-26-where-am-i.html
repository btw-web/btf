<h1>Day 26: Where Am&nbsp;I?</h1>
<p>Am I really in the Arctic in February? I ask myself as I clamber from my tent once more. I’ve been wild-camping for several days and have noticed that I’m emitting an increasingly blood-curdling reek. Unsurprising — it’s been almost a week since I last took off my long-sleeved baselayer.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/5486022281/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/5132/5486022281_a627d7c72d.jpg?resize=500%2C332&#038;ssl=1" alt="Snow coated bike" width="500" height="332"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a><br>
<!--more--></p>
<p>The reason I’m asking myself this question is because I’d imagined the winter up here to be nothing but bitter and merciless. Trust a bike trip to smite down a few preconceptions. My tent is coated in wet, sticky snow — my bike also. It must be really warm to have glued itself to my gear this&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>I’ve stealth-camped in a national park just up the hill from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route_E6">E6 route</a> that shadows Norway’s coast right round to the Russian border. It’s almost 3,000km in length, a main road by all accounts; but here the traffic is benign — I could be riding on a quiet B‑road in England. Today it is a wide channel of dirty meltwater, with a few patches of slush that confound my attempts to hold a steady line in case a truck-driver decides to pass particularly closely.</p>
<p>Hold on a second. This isn’t winter. This isn’t freezing cold. Having already stripped off my hat, neck-warmer and gloves, and unzipped every bit of my jacket I can find, I stop on the side of the&nbsp;road.</p>
<p>And I force myself to accept that today is significantly warmer than several of those December days I spent riding in my local area in England wearing a thin T‑shirt and a single-layer waterproof jacket. Why the hell am I wearing a bloody great skiing jacket, padded skiing trousers and woolen underwear?!?</p>
<p>The answer is easy, of course: up until yesterday, I needed all of it. Monitoring and adjusting clothes and accessories has always occupied a sizeable portion of my mental energy. But this sudden change is a great wallop round the&nbsp;chops.</p>
<p>Finally I wrestle my winter clothes into a pannier and continue, feeling bizarrely nimble and unencumbered. It’s a quirk of a thoroughly unsettled local climate, I think, and I just happen to be here during an unseasonal spell of warmth.</p>
<p>Soon I come across a road tunnel, donning headtorch and setting rear light flashing. And when I emerge from the far side and look about me, I’m suddenly transported three years back to the time when Andy and I were riding along the Black Sea coast of Turkey, on our way — or so we thought — to the Caucasus, Iran and Central Asia.</p>
<p>My overriding memory of those days in December 2007 is a feeling of misery and darkness. At no other time before or since can I remember riding day after day after bloody day in such soul-destroying conditions, just for the sake of doing distance. It was perpetually freezing cold and damp, constantly (it seemed) raining, the road was a tedious truck-route, the days were far too short to cover much ground, and Andy and I weren’t getting on particularly well any more after six months living in each other’s pockets and with the stress of being entirely unequipped to deal with the climate.</p>
<p>(This all ended rather abruptly when I fell down a hole in a tunnel, smashed my face in and ended up in hospital, tended to — I seem to remember — by a particularly pretty young nurse. At the time this seemed infinitely preferable than actually continuing to&nbsp;ride.)</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/5486025819/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/5091/5486025819_d59c3d9414.jpg?resize=500%2C332&#038;ssl=1" alt="Coastal road E6 in Nordland" width="500" height="332"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Here on the coast of Norway — superficially at least — seems oddly similar. All the ingredients are present: a dramatic, cold, wet, storm-lashed coastline; precipitous mountains in the distance; an eternal succession of sweaty climbs and chilly descents amidst road-spray and trucks thundering past. I even meet an old man with bushy eyebrows who doesn’t speak English and who verbally bombards me with nationalities until he hits the correct one. The parallels are just uncanny.</p>
<p>This somehow puts me in a dark mood, reflecting on those long-ago times, and I consider how that now-recollected phase of my first big ride and this soon-to-be-finished little outing are both fruits borne of an abrupt change in direction I’d made in my life even longer ago again, when I decided that to sell everything and just pedal was the only sensible option I had. Goodness — it seems like an eternity ago.… a parallel universe almost.</p>
<p>Yes; as a lady I met in the Swiss mountains once wisely noted, that change had been “a pillar in my&nbsp;life”.</p>
