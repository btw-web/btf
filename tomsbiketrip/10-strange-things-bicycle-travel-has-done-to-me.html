<h1>10 Strange Things Bicycle Travel Has Done To&nbsp;Me</h1>
<p>It’s difficult to notice the subtle changes that come over you during a journey of duration and difficulty, but certain situations have alerted me to them very strongly.</p>

<p>I’ve only been travelling for a couple of years, but this must be where the curve is at its steepest. Here are a few, both good and bad, of the weird things that have surprised me recently:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I’m mortally afraid of moving faster than a bicycle.</strong> <!--more-->Travel has made me resistant to many of the common fears of my home society, especially regarding the so-called ‘unknown’. But put me in a taxi or minibus heading out of town, and I break out in a cold sweat! It seems like such a silly idea to bomb around in a tin box on wheels at such speeds!</li>
<li><strong>I can’t sleep in beds.</strong> I’ve spent the months since I returned from Africa sleeping on the floor. Anything softer than a thin sleeping pad makes my body ache in strange places.</li>
<li><strong>I can’t take hot showers.</strong> They put me to sleep, and all of a sudden seem extravagant. Mornings bring with them the need to embrace the day, not to remember how nice and cosy it is to stay at home in lethargy.</li>
<li><strong>I can’t sleep after dawn.</strong> The first light wakes me up and I’m compelled to jump out of bed. The clock is irrelevant. A lie-in is an impossible dream, and staying out late requires great stamina or strong coffee. This is a far cry from university days of getting up in time to watch the sun <em>set</em>!</li>
<li><strong>I don’t contemplate ‘what if’.</strong> The decision to do something big now leads in a straightforward manner towards doing it, rather than thinking about what might go wrong/what other people might think/what if I fail. But sometimes this means that I rush into something and find myself in a pickle, having not thought it out very&nbsp;well.</li>
<li><strong>Everywhere is assessed for sleeping potential.</strong> I can’t help it! If I see a flat, dark, secluded place, I automatically start weighing up the likelihood of getting away with spending a night there. It doesn’t matter if it’s a city-centre building site, a field in the middle of nowhere, or your back garden.</li>
<li><strong>The fight/flight reaction has changed its balance.</strong> In a confrontation, the sensible thing to do is to walk away. But in Ethiopia, confrontations (mostly non-violent) occurred several times a day from which I could not walk away. This affected me so strongly that it still rubs off on every day life — not&nbsp;good.</li>
<li><strong>I read the news differently.</strong> I never really paid much attention to international affairs before. Or national affairs, for that matter. Now, events fit into a much bigger picture. And the spin and inaccuracy are almost as alarming as the misconceptions they generate in normal, decent people.</li>
<li><strong>I’m more sensitive.</strong> I don’t mean this in a romantic way! But I’ve found my emotional responses are far stronger now. I empathise more powerfully with the circumstances of real and fictional characters. Recently I shed tears of happiness for the first&nbsp;time.</li>
<li><strong>I know I don’t fit in.</strong> When younger, I struggled to find my place amongst society. Now I’ve come to the conclusion that I never will. To most people, I will always be a bit of a weirdo. So I’ve stopped caring about&nbsp;it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wonder if any of these things will ‘change back’ in the future?</p>
<p>Most cycle travellers I’ve met have felt their lives changed by their experiences. Many have involved an element of self-awakening, and a consequent struggle to accept what is revealed. It’s common to hear us extolling the virtues of bicycle journeys, and less common to hear of the problems it has caused us.</p>
<p><strong>If you’ve been on a long bicycle journey, how has it affected you?</strong></p>
