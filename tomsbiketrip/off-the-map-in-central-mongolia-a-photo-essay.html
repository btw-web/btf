<h1>Off The Map In Central Mongolia — A Photo&nbsp;Essay</h1>
<p>Mongolia is a far more accessible place for a mountain-biking expedition than I’d imagined. Navigation has been a mixture of old techniques and new technology. Our GPS unit didn’t help us to choose a route through the maze of tangled tyre tracks, but it did provide a bearing and an approximate distance to the next small provincial town — which would always provide supplies, electricity, a meal and a mobile phone connection. In terms of facilities, everything we’ve needed has rarely been more than a day or two&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>After Bulgan we headed for the back-country. Riding the main route, though relatively easy going, quickly became a monotonous undertaking. Away from this, our sheet-map of the country provided us with the name of the next settlement, and armed with this knowledge we proceeded through the silent vastness of the countryside, pedalling along the streak of bare earth that best corresponded to the gestures of passing motorcyclists and horsemen, out herding for the day, and our combined common sense and experience.</p>
<p>We found ourselves covering more distance than we’d expected — our plan was to average somewhere around 35km per day, but 55km has been more common. The conditions have been challenging, but not overpoweringly so. It really helps to have benchmarks like Sudan and Ethiopia when tackling unpaved routes like&nbsp;this!</p>
<p>We’ve spent several days off in Moron, a relatively large regional capital in north-central Mongolia, in order to rest and to let an unexpected cold/cough to work its way through my system before continuing. There’s plenty more to say, but just for a change I’ll let the pictures do the talking. It’s been a fantastic ride so&nbsp;far.</p>

In many countries this would be a cause for alarm, but in Mongolia it’s possible to ride directly across the step, and following a valley or heading for a water source is guaranteed to bring you in contact with at least one herding family and their ger in order to check directions. Once we got used to this kind of geographical freedom, we started to push further and further off the well-worn paths.</figcaption></figure>

The speed at which storms blow in is incredible, given the vastness of the landscapes. Usually they threaten rain but deliver only a stiff breeze that makes pitching camp somewhat arduous.</figcaption></figure>
<p></p><figure style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="'Road' sign" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4665218973/"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4665218973_2ed892467e_z.jpg?w=580" alt="'Road' sign" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was the only roadsign I saw for a week. It doesn’t point to a settlement, either — this reads ‘Hanuy Tour’. Hanuy is the name of a small river and of a natural spring which we couldn’t find.</figcaption></figure>
<p></p><figure style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="Evening campfire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4665845764/"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4665845764_392d8e430f_z.jpg?w=580" alt="Evening campfire" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">It was a great change of scenery when forests started becoming more commonplace. Trees are harvested for timber and firewood, but there is no evidence of large-scale deforestation thus far. The trees grow quickly during the short summer in order to survive the bitter winter.</figcaption></figure>
<p></p><figure style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="Photographer" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4665847566/"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4032/4665847566_50768829b3_z.jpg?w=580" alt="Photographer" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A shrine such as the one Andy is photographing here is an essential piece of furniture at the top of each pass, no matter how remote. We’d been following a very faint pair of tyre tracks all day and were surprised to come across a shrine of this size at the top of the final&nbsp;climb.</figcaption></figure>

Despite the remoteness and lack of transport infrastructure, these small towns are well-stocked with provisions and facilities for the traveller. A packet of Korean instant noodles is never far&nbsp;away.</figcaption></figure>
<p></p><figure style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="Basketball in the middle of nowhere" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4665230933/"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/farm2.static.flickr.com/1267/4665230933_1aea492ff0_z.jpg?w=580" alt="Basketball in the middle of nowhere" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">High up a long climb in a remote valley, we came across a set of goalposts and a basketball net. The nearest ger was several kilometres down the valley.</figcaption></figure>
<p></p><figure style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="Another epic valley" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4665231655/"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4030/4665231655_c394765558_z.jpg?w=580" alt="Another epic valley" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Off-road travel in Mongolia generally seems to involve repeated traversals of vast valleys twenty or thirty kilometres wide. A long climb precedes an adrenalin-filled descent, followed by a monotonous grind across a windy valley floor. The process is repeated. Luckily, each valley often seems to have its own micro-climate and its own distinctive character, which keeps things interesting in the long&nbsp;run.</figcaption></figure>
<p></p><figure style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="White Horse" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4665233205/"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4061/4665233205_15644b59af_z.jpg?w=580" alt="White Horse" data-recalc-dims="1"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Horses play a large part in the rural lifestyle. Sometimes they are herded in large groups, like other domestic livestock, and sometimes they roam in small units or&nbsp;alone.</figcaption></figure>

This one marked our rejoining of the main route to Moron. Another benign storm loomed across the valley but ultimately failed to deliver.</figcaption></figure>
