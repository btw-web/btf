<h3>What Stops You From Following Your Dreams?</h3>
<p>The single thing that made a difference for me that day — about 19 months ago now — was a subtle change in belief.<!--more--></p>
<p>I believed I could do&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I believed I <em>would</em> do&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>And now I’m doing&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>(Cycling around the world, that&nbsp;is.)</p>
<p>The idea of quitting my job to see the world had been an unattainable dream for one day too many. Sitting in front of my computer — again — reading about the adventures of others, something started to change inside me.</p>
<p>That day, I seized the moment once and for&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>And so the first step to making my dream come true was as simple as deciding that it&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;come true; deciding that if I didn’t pursue it with all my heart it would&nbsp;never happen. Nobody else would pursue it for&nbsp;me.</p>
<h3>Decide To Live Your&nbsp;Dream</h3>
<p>The word ‘decision’ comes from the Latin word&nbsp;‘incision’; to cut&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>To make a true decision, you have to cut off all alternatives.</p>
<p>This is the crucial difference from expressing a want, a desire, a ‘could’ or a ‘should’, all of which leave far to much wiggle room to stand much chance of happening.</p>
<p>I’d discovered the world of bicycle touring as a means to an end, rather than because of any particular desire to ride a bicycle. I’d wanted to go on an adventure to see the world for an extended period of time, and I was working endlessly to find a way to make it happen.</p>
<p>One day I discovered a movement of people making their way from country to country on bicycles.</p>
<p>“Brilliant!” I thought.</p>
<p>Then: “Perhaps this is how I can make my dream come&nbsp;true?”</p>
<p>And so began the journey — and what a journey it continues to be — from complete novice to actually touring the world on a bike. Many an evening I spent absorbing the wisdom of other bicycle travellers, planting the mental seeds, now being harvested by the challenges thrown up on the&nbsp;road.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5074 img-polaroid alignnone" alt="2013-08-22 13-21-10" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-08-22-13-21-10.jpg?resize=580%2C435" width="580" height="435" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-08-22-13-21-10.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-08-22-13-21-10.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-08-22-13-21-10.jpg?resize=555%2C416&amp;ssl=1 555w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>But the problem for most is not access to relevant, practical information. It is a lack of self-belief, creating all kinds of obstacles between them and the starting line. How often do you hear someone saying something along the lines of “I can’t do  because ”?</p>
<p>Remove the excuses. Do it now, before the dream falls by the wayside.</p>
<h3>The Universe Will Support You (If You Persist)</h3>
<p>Something very special happens when you decide to follow a&nbsp;dream.</p>
<p>First, the universe will throw a spanner in the works to test your congruence. (The size and nature of the spanner will be proportionate to your lack of congruence.)</p>
<p>But once over this hurdle, designed to shake out the tyre-kickers, the universe will conspire to help you make your dreams come&nbsp;true.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it” –Goethe</p></blockquote>
<p>Leaving a good job and my loved ones behind, I was in way out of my depth. And I spent the first week on the road asking myself: “What was I thinking?”</p>
<p>Then, on my first night in a foreign land, searching desperately for somewhere to camp, the universe intervened — in the form of a stranger inviting me into their&nbsp;home.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5073 img-polaroid alignnone" alt="2013-09-11 13-39-02" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-09-11-13-39-02.jpg?resize=580%2C435" width="580" height="435" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-09-11-13-39-02.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-09-11-13-39-02.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-09-11-13-39-02.jpg?resize=555%2C416&amp;ssl=1 555w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>So try it&nbsp;now.</p>
<p><em>Decide</em> to follow your&nbsp;dream.</p>
<p>And trust the universe to help you overcome the obstacles along the&nbsp;way.</p>
