<p class="has-large-font-size">One day in 1884, Thomas Stevens left California on a bicycle, carrying a bag of gold and a pistol rolled up in a blanket, and became the first person in recorded history to cycle round the&nbsp;world.</p>



<p>Today’s bicycle travellers, of course, pack <strong>much more gear than that</strong>. That’s because we want to <em>enjoy</em>&nbsp;seeing the world, rather than bribing and bullying our way around as Stevens did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To carry all the modern equipment available today – <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/whats-the-best-tent-for-cycle-touring/">ultralight tents</a>, <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/how-to-choose-a-camping-stove-for-cycle-touring-or-bikepacking/">portable camping stoves</a>, <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/the-ultimate-fix-anything-cycle-touring-toolkit-complete-contents/">specialised bicycle tools</a>, and <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/cycle-touring-kit-list/">a whole lot more</a> – many of us will be mounting <strong>panniers</strong> on our bicycles. The pannier has been the traditional luggage of cycle tourists for more than a century.</p>

<p><strong>This article is all about how to choose a set of panniers that’ll fit your budget, your style of touring, and the equipment and supplies you’re carrying with&nbsp;you.</strong></p>



<p>It’s based not just on my own 15 years of cycle touring experience but that of countless veteran riders who I’ve cycled alongside and interrogated about their own gear setups, with the goal of creating the most balanced pannier buying guide possible (no pun intended).</p>



<p>Alongside the detailed listings of the best panniers on the market right now, I’ll include direct links to manufacturers’ webpages and buying links for retailers in Europe and North America (affiliate links are identified with an asterisk; <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/affiliate-links/">click here</a> to read my full affiliate policy).</p>



<p>But I don’t want to assume anything about your prior knowledge, so let’s start by laying out the basics about panniers for cycle touring before we dive into the details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(If you prefer to skip the newbie questions, you can also <a href="#pannier-listings">go straight to the pannier listings</a>.)</p>



<h3>What Exactly Are Bicycle Panniers?</h3>

<p>Panniers are purpose-made bags designed to be hung off the sides of a bicycle or motorbike (or, originally, slung over a pack animal). They are almost always designed to be used in pairs, for what I hope are obvious reasons of balance and stability.</p>



<h3>Do I Need Two Or Four Panniers (Or Something Else)?</h3>

<p>The traditional setup for long-distance cycle touring is <strong>four panniers</strong> – a small pair at the front and a larger pair at the rear – plus a handlebar bag and a few other&nbsp;bits.</p>



<p>This is simply because, when you make a list of everything you’d need for a transcontinental or round-the-world ride, buy it all, and try to fit it onto a bike – <em>it usually fills four panniers.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="385" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-16-tomsbiketrip-com-750x498.jpg?resize=580%2C385" alt class="wp-image-13754" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-16-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=750%2C498&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-16-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-16-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-16-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-16-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1536%2C1020&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-16-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1200%2C797&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-16-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1980%2C1315&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-16-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-16-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?w=1740&amp;ssl=1 1740w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>If you can live with the compromises of packing light, a single pair of rear panniers can suffice for fair-weather road trips of many months.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Two panniers</strong> (either front or rear) can be plenty for lightweight trips, such as short summer rides close to home with lots of bike shops, resupply stops and other facilities on your&nbsp;route.</p>



<p>You might also use two panniers in the longer term with a minimal approach to packing, especially as camping equipment grows ever lighter. You’ll often see more experienced riders taking this approach, because they’ve spent a long time learning what they <em>don’t</em> need to&nbsp;pack.</p>

<p>Increasingly you’ll also see a <strong>hybrid approach</strong>, with a pair of small front or rear panniers supplemented by <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/whats-really-the-difference-between-bikepacking-cycle-touring/">bikepacking</a> luggage such as frame bags, seat packs and cockpit pouches. Panniers can then be removed and stored temporarily for shorter side trips, allowing more flexibility over the traditional setup.</p>



<p>In any case, you’ll rarely see panniers used <em>exclusively</em> as a means of storing belongings and supplies. They’re almost always used alongside rack-top drybags, baskets, handlebar bags, backpacks, or other more easily accessible bags which don’t require you to stop and unpack everything just to find one commonly-used item.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in very special cases such as deep winter, desert crossings, or just because you want to bring your guitar and jewellery-making kit, you might consider a <strong>trailer</strong> instead of (or as well as) panniers, which is <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/the-trailer-versus-panniers-debate-continued/">a topic I’ve covered elsewhere</a>.</p>



<h3>How Do Cycle Touring Panniers Vary In Design?</h3>

<p>Bicycle panniers for cycle touring (as opposed to panniers for, say, grocery shopping) come in a variety of <strong>sizes, colours and</strong>&nbsp;<strong>materials</strong>, and are generally labelled as ‘front’ or ‘rear’. They usually (though not always) are sold in pairs, sometimes with differences between left and right, and sometimes without.</p>



<p><strong>Front panniers</strong>&nbsp;tend to be smaller, and for good reason: whatever weight you’re carrying on the front wheel will feed directly into the steering and handling of your bike. Lighter is therefore better, particularly on rough&nbsp;roads.</p>



<p>A typical front pannier might have a 10–15 litre capacity (ie: 20–30 litres per pair). Larger panniers at the front would also be at risk of hitting the down-tube of the bike (or even the ground) when turning sharply, or interfering with disc brakes.</p>



<p><strong>Rear panniers</strong> tend to have about twice the capacity; around 20–30 litres each (ie: 40–60 litres per pair). Tandem panniers can be even bigger.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, a single pair of rear panniers might suffice for even the longest trips if packed thoughtfully with lightweight gear.</p>



<h3>What Kind Of Pannier Rack Attachment Systems Are&nbsp;There?</h3>

<p>A variety of <strong>attachment systems</strong> exist today, but they almost all make use of a pair of <strong>hooked clips</strong> attached the back of each pannier, allowing them to be hung from the rack tubing, plus some kind of adjustable <strong>retaining tab</strong> on the back of each pannier to hook around the rack tubing and stop them swinging about.</p>



<p>Although pairs of panniers can be identical out of the box, setting up the attachments to fit your racks will usually result in them being configured as ‘left’ and ‘right’ panniers from that point forward.</p>

<p>You’ll occasionally see a pair of panniers attached together with a strip of fabric between them, the whole of which is then slung over the rack. As a general rule, don’t buy these unless it’s the only thing you can get, as this style is far less durable and versatile than individual panniers and rack mounts.</p>



<h3>What Materials Are Panniers Made&nbsp;From?</h3>



<p>In terms of <strong>design and construction material</strong>, there are two main categories of pannier: <strong>fully waterproof</strong> and <strong>semi- or non-waterproof</strong> (often aka: “water resistant”).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="385" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-09-tomsbiketrip-com-750x498.jpg?resize=580%2C385" alt class="wp-image-13747" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-09-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=750%2C498&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-09-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-09-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-09-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-09-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1536%2C1020&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-09-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1200%2C797&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-09-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1980%2C1315&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-09-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-09-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?w=1740&amp;ssl=1 1740w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Riding off-road in northern Mongolia with an Extrawheel Voyager single-wheel trailer and two large pairs of panniers.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fully waterproof panniers</strong>&nbsp;are usually made of laminated fabric with sealed seams, often using the same ‘roll-top’ closure system found in drybags for paddlesports. As with any waterproof gear, you should always pack a simple repair kit – a length of Gaffa Tape at the very least, or perhaps a roll of <a href="https://www.gearaid.com/collections/tenacious-tape">Tenacious Tape</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Non-waterproof (or sometimes “water-resistant”) panniers</strong> are usually made of heavy canvas, with backpack-style lids with zips or buckles, and have some degree of water resistance and/or a waterproof backing plate on the rear to protect against road spray. The repair kit you should pack for this type of pannier is a heavy-duty needle and thread.</p>



<p>(As for which type is <em>better</em>, we’ll come to that later&nbsp;on.)</p>



<p>Some people get hung up on the&nbsp;<strong>colour&nbsp;</strong>of the material. There’s an argument that using black waterproof panniers in sunny climates will result in your belongings being well and truly cooked. Conversely, some people think high-visibility panniers are better for safety, although panniers of all colours are adorned with the same reflective patches.</p>



<p>Personally, I don’t believe there’s much practical difference. If it’s <em>really</em> that hot, lighter colours will be of limited benefit, and <em>you</em>&nbsp;– the rider – should always be more visible than your panniers. My advice is to choose whatever colour panniers you like… and make a hi-viz vest the first thing you put in&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>In short, there’s a <i>lot</i> of variety out there. There are, however,&nbsp;<strong>a few specific makes and models</strong>&nbsp;of bicycle pannier that have proven themselves over many decades on very long and demanding tours.</p>



<p>We’ll start, however, by looking at basic, <strong>budget-friendly</strong> panniers, and work our way up to durable and hard-wearing panniers capable of withstanding years of constant daily&nbsp;use.</p>

<p>When it comes to cheap panniers at the bottom end of the market, a trip to any mainstream bike shop or outdoor retailer (eg: <a class="thirstylink affiliatelink" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Category: Panniers / Go Outdoors" href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/recommends/category-panniers-go-outdoors/" data-shortcode="true">Go Outdoors</a> or <a class="thirstylink affiliatelink" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Category: Panniers / Decathlon UK" href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/recommends/category-panniers-decathlon-uk/" data-shortcode="true">Decathlon</a> in the UK, <a class="thirstylink affiliatelink" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Category: Panniers / REI" href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/recommends/category-panniers-rei/" data-shortcode="true">REI</a> in the USA, or <a class="thirstylink affiliatelink" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Category: Panniers / MEC" href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/recommends/category-panniers-mec/" data-shortcode="true">MEC</a> in Canada) will demonstrate the endless options in this category.</p>



<p>None can really be said to be better or worse than any other, due to the lack of substantial documentary evidence besides customer reviews (which should always be taken with a pinch of salt, because who exactly <em>are</em> these customers anyway?).</p>



<p>To help you choose reasonably durable cheap panniers, and keep them on the road as long as possible, here are a few&nbsp;tips:</p>



<ul><li>Cheap panniers are often aimed at commuters and shoppers, rather than cycle tourists, so see if you can find something that at least claims to be designed for <strong>touring</strong>&nbsp;use.</li><li>Avoid anything that relies on <strong>zips</strong> for closure of the main compartment, as cheap zips are liable to break. Go for something with <strong>straps and buckles/clips</strong> instead.</li><li>Avoid cheap and flimsy ‘waterproof’ material in favour of <strong>real fabric</strong>, then waterproof everything <em>inside</em> the panniers with carrier bags or drybags as necessary.</li><li>Consider buying or making <strong>waterproof pannier covers</strong>, which are essentially giant elasticated shower caps; they’ll get you to the next shelter (especially when paired with an effective mudguard to stop road-spray soaking the bags from behind).</li><li>Finally, <strong>pack a sewing kit, Gaffa Tape, and cable ties</strong>. I know I’m repeating myself, the point being that you can save a lot of money and solve a lot of problems with a pragmatic attitude.</li></ul>



<p>Recognisable budget brands in the UK and Europe include <b>Altura</b>, <b>Topeak</b>, and <b>B’Twin&nbsp;</b>(<a class="thirstylink affiliatelink" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Category: Panniers / Decathlon UK" href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/recommends/category-panniers-decathlon-uk/" data-shortcode="true">Decathlon</a>’s in-house cycling brand).</p>



<p>What you’re looking for at this end of the spectrum is a <strong>capacity</strong> that matches your packing needs, <strong>compatibility</strong> with your racks, and <strong>as few things to go wrong as possible</strong>.</p>

<h2>Mid-Range Panniers For Cycle Touring</h2>



<p>There are a few mid-range models of pannier that don’t quite meet the criteria for high-end expedition panniers but have nevertheless been shown to cope well with some very long and arduous bicycle journeys. Here I’ll list a few of the best known examples, as well as introducing a couple of lesser known brands that show promise in this category.</p>



<h3>Crosso Dry (Poland, £55/£60 front/rear)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="435" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-38-tomsbiketrip-com-750x563.jpg?resize=580%2C435" alt class="wp-image-13776" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-38-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=750%2C563&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-38-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-38-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-38-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-38-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-38-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-38-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1980%2C1485&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-38-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-38-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?w=1740&amp;ssl=1 1740w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>A pair of Crosso Dry 30-litre front panniers mounted on the rear rack of a Kona Sutra touring bike (in combination with frame luggage).</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="http://crosso.pl/en/">Crosso</a> is a Polish company which has been manufacturing panniers commercially since 2006. If you’re based in Europe and can find a retailer, they make for a good option in the mid range, being considerably cheaper than the big-brand panniers. They’re quite basic in terms of design and materials, but in many ways this is a good thing, and they will serve you well if you look after&nbsp;them.</p>



<p>The waterproof&nbsp;<a href="http://crosso.pl/en/item/bicycle-equipment/dry-en/">Dry</a> panniers come in front/universal and rear pairs with a capacity of 30 and 60 litres per pair respectively, with roll-top closures and welded seams, and a choice of 10 colours. (I’ve had a pair of the rear ones for 12 years, which I’m still happily using after a few repairs.)</p>

<p>The standard&nbsp;<a href="http://crosso.pl/en/technology/mounting-system/">attachment system</a> features two fixed steel hooks at the top, with an inverted hook on an elasticated strap at the bottom to secure the pannier in place. Once you get used to the system it is very easy to mount and dismount the panniers, and it’s surprisingly stable.</p>



<p>Not all racks have a lower horizontal rail to attach the bottom hook, so there is also the more expensive <a href="http://crosso.pl/en/technology/click-system/">Click</a> option, using traditional-style fixtures from German company Rixen+Kaul (who make the popular and widespread KlickFix system). These might be a better choice for extremely long journeys as the fixtures are replaceable.</p>

<p>UK-based <strong>Carradice</strong>’s CarraDry panniers are waterproof, feature a generous capacity (58 litres per pair at the rear) and are very good value for money. They share a very durable mounting system with the heavy duty Super C expedition panniers (below).</p>



<p>Though they can’t be described as 100% watertight, with a lidded drawstring closure system rather than a roll-top drybag-style closure, they’re made of a similar laminated synthetic waterproof fabric as the other panniers in this section, with welded seams and waterproof zips, which will still keep out the heaviest rain.&nbsp;Like other Carradice products, they feature outer pockets as well as the main compartment.</p>



<p>The CarraDry might be a good choice if you’re looking for a high quality pair of waterproof panniers (and you don’t plan on floating them across deep rivers), but your budget can’t quite stretch to the top-end Ortliebs, and/or you want to support this long-running British maker.</p>

<h3>Ortlieb Sport-Roller/Back-Roller City&nbsp;(Global, €85/€95 front/rear)</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ortlieb.com/uk/back-roller-city">City</a> series of Ortlieb panniers is a <strong>cheaper, simplified version of the Classic/Plus</strong> series usually chosen for touring (see&nbsp;below).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ortlieb City range is marketed to commuters, but in reality they are the same as the higher end Ortliebs in terms of shape, capacity, waterproofing and construction materials, made slightly lighter and quite a bit cheaper by a couple of missing features.</p>



<p>So what do you lose by saving some cash? Aside from the limited choice of colours, the most significant thing you lose is <strong>full roll-top closure</strong>. Instead, the top buckles attach to clips on the sides of the pannier, and there’s no extra cinch strap over the top (although you can add one afterwards). This is a less flexible setup with a variable sized load, and less waterproof in the case of a pannier being completely submerged.</p>



<p>There is also no shoulder strap or inner pocket, though neither of those are hugely important for touring. The rack attachment system is the slightly older <a href="https://www.ortlieb.com/us/service/technical/ql-systems/">QuickLock1</a> mechanism, previously used on Classic/Plus panniers which are still going strong after decades – again, not a huge&nbsp;issue.</p>



<p>On the plus side, all of this reduces the overall weight; 760g per pannier for a rear Ortlieb City as opposed to 950g for a rear Ortlieb Classic. And, as mentioned, it reduces the price&nbsp;too.</p>



<p>In my opinion, the extra versatility and feature set of the Classic/Plus panniers is probably&nbsp;worth the extra money if you’re already looking at panniers of this kind of quality. If you’re commuting with a pair of City panniers already and thinking about a tour, however, you’ll get on absolutely fine with&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>Relatively new on the UK scene is the waterproof&nbsp;<a href="https://www.alpkit.com/products/toliari-12-pannier">Toliari</a> pannier range from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Corporation_(certification)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">certified B‑corporation</a> and direct retailer <strong>Alpkit</strong>. If the quality of the rest of their products is anything to go by, they’ll prove durable and well-made, which is why I’ve included them here, but it’s important to say that they are as-yet untested on multi-year expeditions.</p>



<p>Available in three sizes (12/20/30 litres per pannier) in a single graphite colour and sold individually, they’ll probably be of most interest to brand loyalists, being about the same price as the Ortlieb City panniers whose reputation will likely win more buyers, especially outside the&nbsp;UK.</p>



<p>Having said all that, Alpkit’s <a href="https://alpkit.com/pages/sustainability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social and environmental credentials</a> are pretty hard to&nbsp;beat.</p>

<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">The All-Time Best Expedition Panniers For Cycle Touring</h2>



<p>Here we’re going to look in detail at panniers that have at <strong>least a decade</strong>&nbsp;(often two or more) of proven and documented reputation as being suitable for long-haul rides. I’m talking multi-year, round-the-world odysseys with a single set of bags. <em>That</em> kind of ‘long-haul’.</p>

<p>As you might expect, the biggest concern at this end of the market is <strong>durability</strong>. Panniers take a lot of abuse, and not just the bag material – it’s also where<strong> fabric and rack mounts meet</strong> that forces will be concentrated over thousands of miles of bumpy&nbsp;roads.</p>



<p>Holes in canvas can be repaired with a sewing kit, and waterproof material can be patched with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gearaid.com/collections/aquaseal">Aquaseal</a>, <a href="https://www.gearaid.com/collections/tenacious-tape">Tenacious Tape</a>, Gaffa Tape, even puncture patches, all of which are part of a more general <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/the-ultimate-fix-anything-cycle-touring-toolkit-complete-contents/">gear first-aid kit</a>. Broken attachment systems are harder problems to solve. Buying top-quality panniers from a tried-and-tested brand will largely – though never entirely – negate this&nbsp;risk.</p>



<p>The same pannier-buying considerations apply to expedition panniers as they do to budget ones. Are they <strong>compatible</strong> with the <strong>racks</strong> on your bike? And are they appropriately <strong>sized</strong> for the gear you’ll be carrying, plus food&nbsp;space?</p>

<p>As mentioned at the start of this article, many of today’s bicycle travellers could get away with two large rear panniers, a varying rack-top bundle and a bar-bag. Packing for a <strong>round-the-world ride</strong> traditionally calls for <strong>four panniers</strong> – a smaller pair of panniers at the front and a larger pair at the rear – because any trip of many years in length will inevitably require&nbsp;<strong>flexibility</strong>.</p>



<p>You’re unlikely to know exactly what your capacity requirements are until you’ve got your gear laid out in front of you, but as a rule it’s better to distribute weight evenly and have a little extra space than to be overloading your bags and having an unbalanced bike.</p>



<p>Remember that – regardless of ‘official’ capacity rating – most roll-top or buckle-lidded panniers will cinch down or expand a certain amount to accommodate what’s inside.</p>

<p>OK! Let’s look at the <strong>all-time best expedition panniers</strong> available today that have accumulated the most miles around the world on tours of every length, location and level of challenge. (All the RRPs I’ve listed below are per&nbsp;pair.)</p>

<p>Let’s get this out of the way: the single most interesting thing about <a href="https://www.ortlieb.com/uk/products/bike-bags">Ortlieb’s</a> range of roll-top waterproof panniers is that they’re the <strong>most popular</strong> of all the panniers being used on world-ranging tours.</p>



<p>Indeed, in a highly unscientific Twitter survey I conducted while first researching this article, about <strong>⅔&nbsp;of respondents used Ortliebs</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Researching <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/panniers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#panniers</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cycletouring?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cycletouring</a> for an upcoming blog post.

</div></figure>



<p>Seeing everyone using them attracts more people to buy them, and then claim that they’re the “only choice” despite never having used anything else. And so the inertia continues.</p>



<p>Of course, about ⅓ of respondents <em>didn’t</em> use Ortliebs, yet somehow were still perfectly happy.</p>



<p><strong>So: do you <em>really</em> need Ortliebs?</strong></p>



<p>Well, there’s no doubt that they make very good panniers. They’re about the right size for most users. They’re available in a choice of colours. They’re compatible with most touring racks. They’re durable (which doesn’t mean you shouldn’t bring a repair kit), and come with a 5‑year warranty. And they’re in the same price range as most of the other expedition panniers in this&nbsp;list.</p>



<p><strong>In short: the price is competitive and they’re proven to work. You certainly don’t <em>need</em> them, but they’re highly unlikely to disappoint you.</strong></p>



<p>(By the way, second-hand Ortlieb panniers are prime for being snapped up for cheap in early spring, because they’re the kind of thing people buy in January when resolving to start cycling to work and a few weeks later sell barely-used on eBay. <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=ortlieb+panniers&amp;_sacat=177833&amp;LH_TitleDesc=0&amp;_odkw=ortlieb&amp;_osacat=177833&amp;mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;siteid=3&amp;campid=5337534327&amp;customid=&amp;toolid=10001&amp;mkevt=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take advantage</a>*.)</p>



<p>Ortlieb panniers come in <strong>several varieties</strong>. Let’s look at those of most interest to bicycle travellers.</p>



<h4>Ortlieb Sport-Roller/Back-Roller <strong>Plus</strong> (Global,&nbsp;€125/€145)</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="387" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-17-tomsbiketrip-com-750x500.jpg?resize=580%2C387" alt class="wp-image-13755" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-17-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=750%2C500&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-17-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-17-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-17-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-17-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-17-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-17-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1980%2C1320&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-17-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-17-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?w=1740&amp;ssl=1 1740w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>A classic combo: Ortlieb Back-Roller Plus rear panniers mounted on a Surly Long Haul Trucker touring bike.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If there was a Standard Issue Cycle-Round-The-World Kit (now there’s an idea), it would probably include a pair of <a href="https://www.ortlieb.com/sport-roller-plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ortlieb Sport-Roller Plus</a> (formerly known as Front-Roller Plus) panniers at the front and a pair of <a href="https://www.ortlieb.com/back-roller-plus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ortlieb Back-Roller Plus</a> at the rear of the bike, all in matching his-and-hers colours.</p>



<p>At 25 litres per pair for the Sport-Rollers and 40 litres per pair for the Back-Rollers, they’re slightly smaller in rated capacity than other panniers in this list. As with all roll-top panniers, however, you can make fewer rolls when closing them to create more&nbsp;space.</p>



<p>The buckles at the top can either be clipped together, as with a regular drybag, or clipped into a carry strap which then secures to the front of the pannier via a retaining tab near the bottom edge. For additional peace of mind when overloaded, another short strap can be fastened over the top of the closed pannier.</p>



<p>Other useful features include a small handle attached to the rack mounting points for easy attachment and removal of the pannier to the rack, and a removable pouch attached to the backing plate on the inside of the pannier for flat items such as travel documents and diaries.</p>



<p>The current version of the Plus panniers makes use of the <a href="https://www.ortlieb.com/uk/service/technical/ql-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QuickLock2.1</a> attachment system, which is an updated version of Ortlieb’s original system with broader compatibility with the range of racks on the market today (this includes the popular <strong>Tubus</strong> racks, if you’re wondering). With this system, the hooks are locked in place by sprung retainers, which are released when you pull up on the grab handle for easy removal. Inserts are supplied for different rack tubing diameters to ensure a secure, rattle-free fit.</p>



<p><strong>What distinguishes the Plus&nbsp;series from the Classic series</strong> (see below) is the <strong>fabric</strong> used in their construction: a high-grade Cordura-branded nylon weave which is laminated on the inside. This makes the outer surface almost as abrasion-resistant as a canvas pannier, while remaining waterproof due to the laminated inner. As weave is less dense than laminate, the Plus is therefore slightly lighter than the Classic; 840g per rear pannier as compared to&nbsp;950g.</p>

<p>Slightly heavier, cheaper and less abrasion-resistant, going for the wipe-clean <a href="https://www.ortlieb.com/sport-roller-classic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ortlieb Sport-Roller Classic</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.ortlieb.com/back-roller-classic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Back-Roller Classic</a> will save you a few days’ food budget whilst still giving you the sleep-easy feeling of ‘having Ortliebs’. As noted above, the fabric used in construction is a lighter and slightly more basic double-laminated polyester. Besides this, every other aspect is the&nbsp;same.</p>



<p>(It’s worth noting that I have never heard of anyone buying the Classics and then later wishing they’d bought the Pluses. Apart from that guy in the comments. There’s always one.)</p>

<h4>Ortlieb ‘Pro’ Variants</h4>



<p>The Ortlieb Sport-Roller and Back-Roller Plus/Classic panniers above are available in a further variation: <a href="https://www.ortlieb.com/back-roller-pro-classic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pro</a>.</p>



<p>What makes them “pro”? They’re bigger.&nbsp;Instead of 40 litres per pair, you get a whopping 70 litres of capacity.</p>



<p>Can your rack handle that amount of weight? Does your bike have enough heel clearance?&nbsp;Do you <em>need</em> an extra 30 litres of pannier space?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Truth is, the people who’d benefit most from these panniers would be tandem riders (which is who they’re made for), and perhaps people biking in deep winter. The rest of us can just strap a big drybag to the rear rack and only fill it when necessary.</p>

<p>Carradice’s <a href="https://www.carradice.co.uk/ranges/super-c">Super C range</a> is a classic line of British hand-made bags and panniers, the designs changing little in decades. (I’ve had a pair of the rear panniers hanging off my own touring bike for 15 years and counting.)</p>



<p>Stitched from heavy-duty waxed ‘cotton duck’ canvas of the type used for military kit and old-school tents, they’re far more resistant to abrasion than waterproof panniers with laminated fabrics or even synthetic canvas. You’ll hear stories of pairs of Super Cs being used for upwards of 30 years, by which time Ortliebs will be straining your tea, so if it’s pure longevity you’re after, they’re some of the best panniers going.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carradice.co.uk/bags/panniers/super-c-universal-front-panniers">front (or ‘universal’) panniers</a> have a capacity of 28 litres per pair and, aside from the removable fixtures, are symmetrical in design, with one large main compartment and a small outside pocket in which I might be tempted to store a few snacks. The <a href="https://www.carradice.co.uk/bags/panniers/super-c-rear-panniers">rear panniers</a> have a capacity of 54 litres per pair, with an outside pocket at the rear. Both sizes have buckled lids with adjustable straps, in addition to a drawstring for the main compartment.</p>



<p>Carradice’s attachment system, based on two self-locking hooks along the top inside edge of the bag and with a retaining tab on the rear, has proven its durability on many a round-the-world tour. The fixtures are very adjustable, making them compatible with a wide variety of racks (adapters are available for rack tubing thicker than 13mm), and enabling them to be shifted back a long way for heel clearance. These fixtures are removable – always a good idea when transporting the panniers on planes, trains and&nbsp;buses.</p>



<p>What they are <i>not</i> is 100% watertight. Although the waxed canvas will keep any amount of rain out, it will eventually absorb water if fully immersed, and the lidded closure system will never be as watertight as a roll-top pannier, as discussed above.</p>



<p>Despite this, they are&nbsp;supremely durable receptacles for the (drybagged) gear you’ll keep inside, and I’ve never come across anyone who regretted buying them.</p>



<p>As an example of an ultra-durable canvas pannier, the Carradice Super Cs are certainly the best in the UK, with one of the longest heritages of any pannier on the market.</p>

<p>Part of a bigger line of commuter and messenger bags, German manufacturer <a href="https://www.vaude.com/en-GB/">Vaude</a> make the very nice 100% waterproof <a href="https://www.vaude.com/en-GB/Products/Bike-Bags/Front-Rear-Pannier/">Aqua touring panniers</a> in front and rear variants.</p>



<p>These are strikingly similar to the Ortlieb Classics (see above), and not just superficially: they are also made in Germany, also come with a 5‑year guarantee, also have a versatile one-handed attachment system, also have inside pockets and shoulder straps, and also have a (smaller) following of satisfied users who’ve taken them round the world by bicycle.</p>



<p>The biggest difference is that&nbsp;they’re slightly larger (despite being about the same weight), with a rated capacity of 28/48 litres front/rear compared to 25/40 for the Ortliebs.</p>



<p>If you’re concerned about your environmental impact (and obviously you should be), you might be interested in the fact that the Aqua panniers are ‘climate neutrally manufactured’, ie: all manufacturing and shipping emissions have been carbon offset, and are fully PVC and PFC free. Indeed, Vaude have put a great deal of emphasis on their green credentials in recent years.</p>



<p>Why don’t more people don’t buy them, then? Simple:<strong>&nbsp;they’re not Ortliebs</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.arkel-od.com/">Arkel</a> are a small Canadian outfit established in 1988 whose panniers’ reputation (and price) exceeds even that of Ortliebs. Their top-end <a href="https://www.arkel-od.com/en/gt-54-grand-touring-cycling-bags.html">GT-54 classic touring panniers</a> come from an entirely different line of thinking, full of pockets and sections and zips and straps and other finery – consider them the Rolls Royce to Ortlieb’s Land&nbsp;Rover.</p>



<p>There are plenty of riders out there who would claim that these panniers are, in fact, the very best in the&nbsp;world.</p>



<p>Slightly more affordable – and perhaps easier to get hold of if you’re based in Canada or the USA – is their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.arkel-od.com/en/waterproof-panniers.html">Orca</a> line of waterproof panniers, which are of the simpler roll-top design.</p>

<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus</span>: The Great Pannier Waterproofing Debate</h4>



<p class="p1">There are lots of noisy opinions on the internet about pannier waterproofing. Discovering this ‘debate’ can be worrying for people who are spending two or three hundred pounds/euros/dollars on a full set of panniers, and planning to put a lot of stuff inside them that they really don’t want getting wet.</p>



<p class="p1">The debate boils down to <strong>whether you should buy fully waterproof, roll-top, seam-sealed, drybag-style panniers</strong> and never worry about rain or river crossings ever again, or whether there’s <strong>any other type of pannier</strong>&nbsp;worth considering.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="385" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-10-tomsbiketrip-com-750x498.jpg?resize=580%2C385" alt class="wp-image-13748" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-10-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=750%2C498&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-10-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-10-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-10-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-10-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1536%2C1020&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-10-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1200%2C797&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-10-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?resize=1980%2C1315&amp;ssl=1 1980w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-10-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/panniers-for-cycle-touring-10-tomsbiketrip-com.jpg?w=1740&amp;ssl=1 1740w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The time a pannier detached itself and floated off downstream during a river crossing in northern Mongolia. We’ve all been&nbsp;there.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here’s my&nbsp;take.</p>



<p class="p1">Although the 100%-waterproof option looks appealing, I haven’t met a long-term rider (ie: who’s spent years on the road) whose 100% waterproof panniers have <em>stayed</em> 100% waterproof.</p>



<p class="p1">This is nothing to do with quality. It’s because no piece of fabric can survive an unlimited amount being bashed into things, falling off the bike, being trodden on, tripped over, tied to sharp metal roof racks on buses and taxes, thrown into aircraft holds and pickup trucks, or ripped apart by hungry bears hunting for the smell of toothpaste (true&nbsp;story).</p>



<p class="p1">Some riders anticipate this and prepare for it by bringing a repair kit. Some don’t, and then criticise their expensive panniers for not being 100% waterproof. A lucky few somehow manage to avoid getting a single hole in their panniers, and claim this as evidence that they’ll be ‘bomb-proof’ for everyone else. They&nbsp;won’t.</p>



<p class="p1">If very heavy rain and wading through rivers is likely to be a regular feature of your trip, then drybag-style panniers and a patch kit is probably the better option.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="p1">If you don’t mind a little extra ‘pannier admin’, however, there <em>is</em> another legitimate approach: <strong>waterproof what’s&nbsp;<i>inside</i> the pannier as and when you need to</strong>.</p>

<p class="p1">For a little extra effort, this approach will allow you to exploit the many advantages&nbsp;of <strong>breathable, canvas panniers</strong>:</p>



<ul><li class="p1">Wet gear (and smelly gear) can be isolated from the remaining contents and allowed to dry during a day’s riding,</li><li class="p1">Fuel bottles and other potentially messy items can be prevented from contaminating other contents,</li><li class="p1">In hot weather, perishable food can be kept longer in a breathable pannier than inside a sealed drybag,</li><li class="p1">Canvas panniers are easier to repair with a needle and thread or by giving them to a local tailor or cobbler,</li><li class="p1">Top quality cotton canvas is, all else being equal, more abrasion-resistant than laminated synthetic fabric, and on a long tour this will bear the brunt of the punishment while the drybags inside remain protected.</li><li class="p1">Canvas looks cooler. The odd hole here and there will simply add to a pannier’s character.</li></ul>



<p>The extra ‘pannier admin’ involves putting your gear into <strong>drybags</strong> <em>inside</em> the pannier (good ones are made by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.seallinegear.com/dry-bags">Seal Line</a>, <a href="http://www.exped.com/uk-ireland/en/product-category/packsacks">Exped</a>, <a href="https://seatosummitusa.com/collections/waterproof-dry-bags">Sea to Summit</a>, <a href="https://www.alpkit.com/featured/dry-bags">Alpkit</a> and many other brands); either one large drybag used as a pannier liner, or lots of smaller ones for organisation and selective waterproofing (or a combination of the&nbsp;two).</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Either approach&nbsp;<i>will</i> carry your gear and keep it dry</strong> if you know the strengths and weaknesses of each and have a packing routine to&nbsp;match.</p>



<p class="p1">I’ve used both types myself on long-term rides in all conditions, from a free pair of shopping panniers for a rainy spring ride through England to heavy-duty canvas bags across the Middle East and Africa to roll-top waterproof panniers <em>and</em> canvas bags together in Mongolia. Analysing which of these systems is ‘best’ is not something I feel the need to spend any more time discussing, because all of them can be made to&nbsp;work.</p>



<p class="p1">The truth is that most long-term riders&nbsp;use roll-top waterproof panniers – in particular, the Ortlieb ones mentioned above – <strong>because everyone else does</strong>. It’s a conformity thing. Non-conformists might prefer the tramp-like image engendered by dusty canvas. If you can’t decide, flip a&nbsp;coin.</p>
