<h1>How To Start A Travel Blog: A 5‑Minute Intro To How Easy It Really Is</h1>
<p>Travel blogging direct from the road, on your backpacking/walking/cycling/skateboarding/unicycling trip, is not only a realistic ambition: with today’s technology it’s also a piece of cake and costs very little.</p>
<p>Read on for a quick primer…</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3>What Is Travel&nbsp;Blogging?</h3>
<p>Travel blogging is the act of regularly updating a blog, such as the one you are reading now, while you’re travelling – whether from an&nbsp;internet cafe or hostel or WiFi or kind host with an internet connection. You’ll also likely be posting updates from the road or trail; whether it be your tent, bivvy-bag, hammock, or just sitting around somewhere nice.</p>
<h3>What Gear Do&nbsp;You Need?</h3>
<p>A smartphone and perhaps a Bluetooth keyboard is all you <em>need</em>.</p>
<p>If you want to get fancy: a tablet or a netbook, mobile data connection, and a separate&nbsp;digital camera/camcorder.</p>
<p>Really fancy? Full-on MacBook Pro, DSLR and all the accessories, pro video camera, sound recorder, paid Flickr/Vimeo account, satellite phone, solar panels, extra batteries, support crew, PR team, Google sponsorship deal,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/7260242876/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/7236/7260242876_c65c69c1d3.jpg?resize=500%2C333&#038;ssl=1" alt="Stealth charging" width="500" height="333"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Let’s now look at your&nbsp;software/platform options in more detail:</p>
<h3>How To Set Up A New Travel&nbsp;Blog</h3>
<p>The most popular blogging software by a country mile is <strong>WordPress</strong>, which comes in two flavours (<a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">hosted</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">self-hosted</a> — this blog is self-hosted), depending on whether or not you know what a domain name and a hosting package are.</p>
<p>Both allow you to use a special set of administrative web-pages to post your blogs, both allow you to upload images, and both allow you to send updates by&nbsp;email.</p>
<p>If you are confident enough to buy a web-hosting package, I use&nbsp;<a href="http://my.vidahost.com/aff.php?aff=1951" target="_blank">Vidahost</a>* in the UK for all my web hosting services and can recommend them – use the voucher code <strong>TOMSBIKETRIP</strong> for 10% off. (You’re welcome.)</p>
<p>Most hosting companies will enable you to install WordPress with a couple of clicks through the included ‘control panel’ for your account.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Setting up your blog is quite self-explanatory from there on, and&nbsp;if you want a flavour of just how easy it is, try reading about&nbsp;</span><a style="line-height: 1.428571429; background-color: #ffffff;" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Install" target="_blank">WordPress’s Famous 5‑Minute Install</a><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">.</span></p>
<p>If you have no idea what I am talking about, visit <a href="http://wordpress.com/signup/" target="_blank">WordPress.com</a>&nbsp;and sign up. They’ll do everything for you, for free, except for buying you a domain name (like <strong>TomsBikeTrip.com</strong>) — instead you’ll get given one like <strong>adventureblog.wordpress.com</strong>, unless you pay&nbsp;extra.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/5449386214/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/4153/5449386214_1fd72a1167.jpg?resize=500%2C332&#038;ssl=1" alt="Coffee shop blues" width="500" height="332"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<h3>How To Post Mobile&nbsp;Blog Updates&nbsp;From The&nbsp;Road</h3>
<p>If you’ve got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone" target="_blank">smartphone</a> and a data subscription, download the WordPress App for your <a href="http://ios.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">iOS</a>, <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Android</a>, <a href="http://blackberry.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Blackberry</a> or <a href="http://nokia.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Nokia</a> device.</p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>Write blogs using the app. Take photos with the built-in camera and add them to your articles. Charge it in petrol stations, cafes, public toilets. Today’s <a href="http://vimeo.com/12819723" target="_blank">smartphone cameras</a> and <span class="removed_link" title="http://vimeo.com/21648733">apps</span> are incredible. Even my old piece-of-crap phone was used to take one of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/3835511587/in/set-72157621957113057" target="_blank">my favourite photos</a>. Job&nbsp;done.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/7005461638/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/7050/7005461638_35e8e3f1c2.jpg?resize=500%2C320&#038;ssl=1" alt="Speed of travel" width="500" height="320"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>If you want to be fancy, use the smartphone or any&nbsp;4G/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G" target="_blank">3G</a>&nbsp;phone with a cable or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth" target="_blank">Bluetooth</a> function, together with the manufacturer’s connectivity software, to connect your laptop or tablet&nbsp;to the internet. This doesn’t have to involve large investments of cash: I used an old, donated Sony Ericsson W850i, which can be found now for about <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/?_nkw=w850i" target="_blank">a quid on eBay</a>, and an <a href="http://www.asus.com/Eee/Eee_PC/Eee_PC_1000H/" target="_blank">Asus EEE 1000H netbook</a> which I got on the cheap in Dubai while cycling there in 2009 — OK, the keyboard is in Arabic, but it&nbsp;works!</p>
<p>Scavenge free WiFi connections on your way through towns — coffee shops are a good bet.&nbsp;Connect your camera(s) or use the memory-card slot, with a free photo-manager like <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" target="_blank">Picasa</a> or a paid one like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html" target="_blank">Lightroom</a>, and resize and upload your pics to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/home" target="_blank">PicasaWeb</a> or <a href="http://flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> directly. Install blog plugins to make adding your pictures from <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/picasa-express-x2/" target="_blank">Picasa</a> or Flickr to your articles a&nbsp;cinch.</p>
<p>4G/3G/GPRS data services are now available pay-as-you-go the world over, coverage is practically global, and speeds are far faster than we all had in our homes 10 years ago. As an example, in Norway I bought a Telenor SIM which allowed me unlimited data transfer for 10 NOK (about £1.10) a day. In Sweden, the same deal with Telia was around £0.85 a day. In Mongolia, I bought £5‑worth of credit and six weeks later I still hadn’t run out. In rural Ethiopian settlements, internet cafes connected via the mobile network were the standard. In the U.S., T‑mobile charge $2/day for unlimited data on a pay-by-the-day basis.</p>
<p>Walk into a kiosk or high-street store; walk out with your affordable mobile data connection. It’s only going to get cheaper.</p>
<p>If you’re in the jungle or desert or out on the Arctic sea-ice and want to be really fancy, get out your full-size laptop, solar power system and <a href="http://www.inmarsat.com/service/bgan/" target="_blank">BGAN</a> connection. You, your attractive assistant and your support team already know how to use it, and you don’t need this&nbsp;guide.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/5452831767/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/5093/5452831767_299474aa89.jpg?resize=500%2C332&#038;ssl=1" alt="Camping in the woods..." width="500" height="332"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<h3>How To Make Travel Blogging&nbsp;Worth Doing</h3>
<p>All of the technical kit is irrelevant. It’s what you’re publishing that counts, and a smartphone-blog will trash the most high-tech comms setup on a single key point: <strong>content</strong>.</p>
<p>A daily write-up of your mileage and how many calories you consumed, together with photos of the wear on your tyres or shoe-soles and the texture of the trail/tarmac, is likely to bore even the most nerdish armchair traveller within a few days. But these kinds of blog are all-too-common.</p>
<p>Successful travel writing depends on painting pictures with words; taking the reader there and imparting something of the emotions you may have felt and lessons you might have learned through your experience.</p>
<p>Successful travel <em>blogging</em> depends on keeping that reader with you; getting them to the end of each piece and coming back for the next one. Regularity can really help, as long as the material remains fresh. But if your trip is long, your followers may tire from repetitive reading as much as you may tire from repeating yourself, so once- or twice-weekly, or less, may be&nbsp;enough. Don’t do it every day for the sake of it — it’ll soon&nbsp;show.</p>
<p>Keep it varied. There is no need to stick to a daily formula; this can and will become — funnily enough — rather formulaic! Maybe focus on a particular theme of the trip each time, or a particular observation, train of thought or encounter. A broad spread of impressions can make for far more interesting and entertaining reading than an attempt to convey the full chronology of events. Less is&nbsp;more.</p>
