<h1>About The Time I Upcycled A Vintage Hardtail For Bikepacking &amp; Rode It Across Armenia</h1>

<p>In the months leading up to <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/bikepackingarmenia-why-after-12-years-of-cycle-touring-im-finally-riding-for-charity/">Bikepacking Armenia</a>, I thought long and hard about whether to get myself a shiny new ‘bikepacking rig’ for the&nbsp;trip.</p>



<p>Since I was in the UK for a few weeks in May, I took the opportunity to test-ride a <a href="https://www.alpkit.com/sonder/sonder-frontier">Sonder Frontier</a> with <a href="https://www.adventurepedlars.com/">Adventure Pedlars</a> in the Peak District. I tried out a <a href="https://surlybikes.com/bikes/karate_monkey">Surly Karate Monkey</a> at the <a href="http://cycletouringfestival.co.uk/">Cycle Touring Festival</a>, and I began mentally drafting my friends at Kona an email to see if they had a spare <a href="https://konaworld.com/unit_x.cfm">Unit X</a> lying around.</p>



<p>These bikes all fitted the current vogue for adventure bikes – all-terrain geometry, tubeless fatties on big wheels, mounts and braze-ons aplenty. They were all damn fun to ride. And deliciously tempting. Because, as every cyclist knows, the number of bikes you need is always <em>n</em> + 1, where <em>n</em> is the number of bikes you already have.</p>



<p><strong>Then something happened.</strong></p>



<p>A friend of mine, who happens to be an environmental campaigner as well as a long-distance cyclist, collared me after my talk about the time I’d <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/how-far-can-you-go-on-a-scrapyard-touring-bike/">rescued a bike from a scrapyard</a> and <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/freelejog-the-total-bill-for-a-bicycle-journey-the-length-of-england/">pedalled the length of England</a> on it for £0.25. My friend thought it was a great example of minimising wastefulness by reusing discarded products, and how the world didn’t need any more new stuff; that our hobbies and passions shouldn’t be exempted from the principle of ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’.</p>



<p>Yes, everyone who doesn’t own a bicycle should probably get one, as the world needs more people riding bikes, she said. But people like us would do well to ask ourselves – whenever the moment comes – “do I actually need another new&nbsp;bike?”</p>



<p>I found myself nodding in agreement as we wandered back over to the Ghyllside Cycles gazebo to drool once more over the Karate Monkey. And then I saw my own hypocrisy.</p>



<p><em>No, I did not actually need another new&nbsp;bike.</em></p>

<p>Four months later, in September this year, I rode the length of Armenia off-road on the 2007-vintage <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/kona-explosif-2007-steel-mountain-bike-frame-review/">Kona Explosif</a> steel hardtail I’d originally built for my first big bike trip, way back before this whole <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/whats-really-the-difference-between-bikepacking-cycle-touring/">bikepacking thing</a> blew&nbsp;up.</p>

<p><strong>So this article is going to be a bit of a nerdy&nbsp;one.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Because I’ll be going into a <em>vast</em> amount of detail about how I rebuilt this old Explosif for a tough bikepacking expedition, and how it actually fared on the ride itself (spoiler alert: a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lot</span> of things broke), with the goal of answering the question – how far can you push an old bike like this before it really does&nbsp;need replacing?</p>



<h3>Assessing The Original Bike: Which Bits Still&nbsp;Work?</h3>



<p>As you might imagine after so much fully-loaded world touring over so many years, the bike wasn’t exactly in mint condition.</p>

<p>The chromoly frame had accumulated a good share of dents and chips, including a big dent in the head tube from a memorable over-the-bars moment in eastern Turkey.</p>



<p>I also found a crack in the rear drive-side dropout, probably from jack-knifing my trailer too many times. But because it was a <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/touring-bike-faq-3-steel-or-aluminium-frames-or-something-else/">steel frame</a>, I could get it repaired and resprayed (by <a href="https://argoscycles.com/">Argos Racing Cycles in Bristol</a>, if you’re wondering, who did a very professional job).</p>

<p>The bike suffered big crash a couple of years back when I broke my own unbreakable rule of <em>never letting anyone ride my bike</em>. It came back with the gear hanger bent and the derailleur smashed into several pieces. Oops.</p>



<p>It was then that I discovered – unsurprisingly – that Kona had stopped making spare gear hangers for this frame… ooh, about seven years&nbsp;ago?</p>

<p>Cue a lot of hunting around on internet forums, whereby I found a fabricator in Israel who specialised in one-off replacement gear hangers for old MTB frames. It wasn’t cheap, but that CNC-machined piece of metal meant I had a frameset which was was once again ready to ride&nbsp;Earth.</p>



<h3>What I Changed, And What Stayed The&nbsp;Same</h3>



<p>I was impressed by how many of the bike’s original components still seemed serviceable after 13 years – testament to choosing durable parts in the first place when <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/how-to-build-the-ultimate-round-the-world-expedition-touring-bike/">building an expedition bike</a>.</p>



<p>The wheels were almost entirely original: Sun Rhyno disc rims on Shimano XT disc hubs using 36 plain-gauge DT Swiss spokes per wheel, hand-built by Leisure Lakes Bikes in Coventry.</p>

<p>I do remember replacing the rear freehub body on a roadside somewhere in Turkey, and the loose ball bearings have been replaced many times. Unfortunately the rear hub races were pitted and rumbling, but I figured the hub would still make it from one end of Armenia to the&nbsp;other.</p>



<p>The only thing I replaced on the rear wheel was the rim tape, which had become misaligned and warped over time: I found some heavily discounted Nukeproof stuff at good old <a href="https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/">Chain Reaction Cycles</a> that did the&nbsp;job.</p>



<p>And the front wheel was as good as new; it didn’t even need truing.</p>



<p>Sure, the wheels were way heavier than they needed to be for a ride like this. But did I really need a new wheelset? No, not really: they still went round when I pedalled.</p>

<p>I took off the old Marathon XRs – may they rest in peace – and fitted Schwalbe Hans Dampf 26x2.35” tyres – not because they were the perfect bikepacking tyre but because they were the fattest compatible knobblies at the biggest discount I could find at the&nbsp;time.</p>



<p>Really, these were enduro tyres, prioritising traction and puncture protection over weight and longevity, but I figured they’d actually be pretty appropriate for the kind of terrain we’d be covering.</p>

<p><strong>Almost unbelievably, much of the original drivetrain was still going strong.</strong></p>



<p>The Shimano 8‑speed trigger shifters hadn’t been touched since the day I installed them – the rear one skipped a shift occasionally when it was cold, probably because the grease was old and gummy, but no big deal (and I couldn’t find replacements anyway).</p>



<p>The ISIS crankset and two of the chainrings had now done tens of thousands of miles, as has the front mech, but seemed to be in good nick. The middle chainring – by far the most used of the three – had worn too much to play nicely with a new chain. With the ISIS system dead and buried, I had to very carefully file down the inside edges of a new Shimano 32-tooth chainring to make it fit the crank bolt mounts.</p>



<p>At the rear end of the drivetrain, the XTR derailleur had been running as smoothly as day one; I think I may have once replaced a bushing in one of the jocky wheels. The cassette – an 8‑speed titanium XTR model that cost a fortune but proved incredibly durable – had a little play in the rivets yet barely any discernible wear.</p>



<p>But the crash had not only smashed the derailleur but snapped off several sprocket teeth. Game over for the cassette.</p>

<p>Off it all came. Onto the freehub went a Shimano 8‑speed Megarange cassette with a 34-tooth big sprocket and a long-cage Alivio derailleur. Re-cabling was necessary, so I fitted full-length Jagwire outer sheaths, and finally got the opportunity to fit the Alligator inner gear cables I was given in 2013 while on a press trip in Taiwan.</p>

<p>I’d removed the original Chris King <strong>headset</strong> to install on Tom’s Expedition Bike, putting in a generic cage-bearing replacement to tide me over. Big mistake. When I removed the fork, fragments of the bearing cage literally fell out of the head&nbsp;tube.</p>



<p>In went a brand new FSA cartridge bearing headset, with a little help from a DIY headset press. The FSA was considerably more expensive than a generic headset, but would last years longer than a throwaway model.</p>

<p>The <strong>fork</strong> was the only really expensive new component on the&nbsp;bike.</p>



<p>For years I’d been running a <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/magura-odur-100mm-front-suspension-touring-fork-review/">Magura Odur</a> 100mm coil-sprung fork, heavy but bombproof – it had helped considerably with comfort and control off-trail in places like Mongolia. In retrospect I should never have sold them on eBay, but I needed the money (I was living in London, riding the frame as a city single-speed while failing to make a living as a travel writer out of the RGS Members’ Room).</p>



<p>In any case, I found the perfect replacement: an end-of-line Fox Float 32 L. This used to be a top-end cross-country fork with a price tag to match. I was lucky to pick up a new 2015 model at a massive discount, the industry having moved on to wider-diameter bolt-through axles and tapered steerer tubes and other such new-fangled gubbins. It was lighter and plusher than the Odur, and (being air-sprung) easy to adjust the sag for different loads – all the better for bikepacking.</p>

<p>The <strong>brakes</strong> were the same <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/magura-louise-hydraulic-disc-brake-review/">Magura Louise</a> hydraulic disc brakes I set out with from England in 2007 (against <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/touring-bike-faq-4-disc-brakes-or-rim-brakes-v-brakes/">all standard touring advice</a>, I should add).</p>



<p>I’d attempted to bleed the front brake once, more out of curiosity than necessity, and only succeeded in making it more spongy by the time I gave up. I’d replaced the rotors once, and the brake pads perhaps two or three times, but aside from that they’d been running for over a decade and survived all the touring I’d done without issue. The pads looked like they had plenty of life in them, and the Fox fork was a disc-only model, so I kept them as they&nbsp;were.</p>

<p>The handlebars, stem and pedals had been changed so many times over the years I’d lost count. I never seemed to get it quite right, and was beginning to suspect that my body may have been mutated in some unreconcilable way.</p>



<p>For this trip I mounted some generic XC riser bars on a short-ish stem atop a stack of spacers, raising the handlebars for comfort and making space for a decent sized cockpit bag. I borrowed the Ergon GP‑1 Biokork grips off the expedition bike – they’re expensive, and I’m too stingy to buy two pairs when I can swap one pair of lock-on grips between bikes.</p>

<p>Build complete, I took it out on a few test-rides in Armenia in the weeks before the expedition, adding a full suite of <a href="https://www.alpkit.com/collections/bikepacking">Alpkit bikepacking bags</a> and tweaking the rig as close to perfection as I&nbsp;could.</p>



<p>And you know what? Despite being more than a decade old and composed mainly from obsolete parts, that wizened old Explosif was as much of a joy to ride as it had ever been. Loaded up, it felt light and nimble yet reassuringly sure-footed on the challenging trails of the Lesser Caucasus. And I can honestly say that it was far more satisfying to recycle this sentimental old hardtail than to splash out on a swanky new one. Cheaper, too.&nbsp;Bonus!</p>

<p>When the time comes to ride, of course, a bike like this needs to do its job and stay out of the way while the adventure unfolds.</p>



<p><strong>In the case of Bikepacking Armenia, that isn’t what happened at&nbsp;all.</strong></p>



<p>I knew from experience that off-road riding increases wear and tear on a bicycle by orders of magnitude. Shocks and vibrations dislodge bolts and fixtures and expose weak points in any luggage setup; abrasive mud and dust eat away at exposed mechanical parts; technical riding introduces forces of a type and strength entirely unlike road touring.</p>



<p>But I was still unprepared for the extent to which this ride would <em>completely trash my bike</em>.</p>



<h3>What Happened When I Actually Rode&nbsp;It</h3>

<p>The expedition began pretty well. All of our bikes made it to the start line by Lake Arpi National Park, undamaged by transit. And though the early-September weather was unseasonably crap, with wintry winds bringing sleet and hypothermia and the team wearing every available layer beneath their waterproofs, my newly rebuilt bike took it all in its stride.</p>



<p><strong>Until Day 4, that&nbsp;is.</strong></p>



<p>I’d been spinning uphill for a few hours along a wet gravel road when we reached a junction. Beyond the junction, the road dipped for a hundred metres or so before continuing its climb. I let go of the brakes to freewheel, enjoying the sudden momentum. Then came a loud metallic crunch, followed by an ominous clockwork clattering. I braked hard and adjusted my pedal position in order to stop – or at least I tried to, but the cranks were locked in place. And I knew immediately what had happened.</p>



<p>A twisted tangle of metal greeted me as I squatted. Bits of my new Alivio derailleur were distributed between the spokes of the rear wheel in an attractive and unusually symmetrical pattern.</p>

<p><strong>Three thoughts flashed through my mind at this&nbsp;point.</strong></p>



<p>The first was mystification: <em>how could this have happened while freewheeling on such an unremarkable stretch of&nbsp;road?</em></p>



<p>The second was a quick calculation: we were too deep into the mountains to turn back; it was just as well to continue over the pass and down to the next town, even if that meant pushing uphill for a few&nbsp;hours.</p>



<p><strong>And the third was the memory of imagining this precise scenario when I’d very deliberately selected, for my original round-the-world adventure, a frame with sliding dropouts.</strong></p>



<p>Within an hour of the incident, I’d got a singlespeed bike, a few spare chain links, and a mangled rear mech as a souvenir. And we packed our tea-making equipment away continued to&nbsp;ride.</p>

<p>Of course, the bit between the junction and the pass was by far the steepest section of the climb, and I did indeed end up walking most of it. But descending slip-and-slide down the rain-sodden valley on the other side, through ‘the most mud I’ve ever seen’ (as one rider put it), endless cattle wades and multiple river crossings, my low-torque singlespeeder – ironically – fared better than the fancy 1x drivetrains and <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/touring-bike-faq-5-derailleurs-or-internal-hub-gears-rohloff/">Rohloffs</a> the other riders were running.</p>



<p>And in the next town, my man-behind-the-scenes Ashot met us with a brand new 8‑speed derailleur he’d picked up in Yerevan for $25, along with the crate of workshop tools and spares we’d prepared earlier.</p>

<p>My <strong>second serious mechanical issue</strong> reared its head as we climbed out of the Aghstev valley and traversed the ridgeline towards Lake Sevan, topping out at a respectable 2,700m.</p>



<p>As the altitude increased, so, it seemed, the performance of my front brake decreased. It took a little while for me to make the connection between braking power and elevation. But over the course of the day, this inverse correlation became obvious.</p>

<p>I am sure someone will offer an explanation of what happens inside a poorly maintained hydraulic brake line as outside air pressure changes. As a layperson, my best guess is that my previous attempts to bleed the brake had in fact put more air in the system, and somehow this was causing a loss of power at altitude. Pumping the lever eventually became second nature, and longer stints of braking seemed to bring back a little bite, perhaps due to heat causing the hydraulic fluid to expand. But in any case, I ended up tackling many of the highest and most remote sections of the route on the rear brake&nbsp;alone.</p>



<p>(When I was eventually reunited with the tools and spares, I did put a new set of pads in, and this seemed to help a little as the pistons pushed back and forced out a little of the excess air.)</p>

<p><strong>The third mechanical was the really catastrophic one.</strong></p>



<p>In retrospect, it was long overdue. I mentioned that I’d last replaced the freehub body in Turkey with a generic Shimano-compatible unit. That had been 12 years ago. Since then, I’d flushed the internal grease out with petrol to avoid it solidifying on a <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/video-letter-from-lapland/">winter ride through Arctic Lapland</a> – after which, these units not being user-serviceable, I’d forced some light oil through it and left it at&nbsp;that.</p>



<p>I guess you could say I’d got my money’s worth out of that freehub body when, on the morning of Day 8, the internal ratchet system gave up and ceased to engage altogether, causing my pedals to spin fruitlessly on the driveway outside the Sevan Writers’ Residence where we’d been staying.</p>



<p>Now, there is a roadside fix for this. It involves tying the cassette to the spokes with cable ties or wire, losing your bottom gear, and riding fixed-gear until you get to a bike shop. But we were about to embark on a four-day backcountry traverse of the Geghama Mountains, which would be by far the most remote and high-altitude stretch of the route. And I really didn’t fancy doing it on a&nbsp;fixie.</p>

<p>Luckily, I’d arranged a resupply that night at the mountain lake where we planned to camp. Off went the riders, with Pete taking over guiding duties, while I strapped my broken bike to the roof of a passing Volga and took a lift to Yerevan with a single mission: find a new rear hub – or, failing that, a new rear wheel – and be back with the group by nightfall.</p>



<p>Once again, the outcome would hinge on decisions I’d made years before. Back in 2007, <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/touring-bike-faq-2-26-inch-or-700c-wheel-size/">26-inch wheels were the default choice for global expeditions</a>, mainly because cheap bikes across the world also used this wheel size, and thus compatible – if low quality – parts would be easy to find in a&nbsp;pinch.</p>



<p>While the picture has changed since then in that high-end bikes and parts are now more widespread, the same rule still applies: the cheapest and thus most commonly found bicycles in places like Armenia are still the same Chinese ‘spam bikes’ with 26-inch wheels, because <em>what’s new</em> doesn’t reflect what people in poorer countries <em>still ride</em>.</p>



<p>The first shop I went to, <a href="http://mybike.am/">MyBike</a>, is actually <a href="http://cyclingarmenia.com/practical-info/the-ultimate-guide-to-yerevans-bike-shops/">one of the best in Armenia</a> for high-end bikes and parts. Of course, they still had a few generic 26-inch rear wheels lying around in the back of the workshop, because people still want them. In the time it took for me to go and get a pizza for lunch (sorry team!), they’d disassembled my broken rear wheel, rebuilt the rim onto a Shimano-compatible 8‑speed rear freehub, re-indexed the derailleur, repositioned the brake caliper, and put it all back together – all for the equivalent of about $40.</p>



<p><strong>Which is exactly why I’d specified a 26-inch mountain bike wheel with mid-range Shimano hubs in the first&nbsp;place.</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>final unexpected mechanical issue</strong> I experienced on this ride came down to a simple error of judgement on my part. I’d underestimated how much extra work the brakes would have to do on this challenging off-road route. In retrospect, I shouldn’t have been surprised when I began to hear that dreaded scouring-scraping sound from my rear brake caliper on the descents. Now I was riding with a flaky front brake and a rear brake that would destroy itself in minutes if I used&nbsp;it!</p>



<p>In the end, I settled for the technique of deliberately overheating my front brake to bring back a little of its failing power and control the final descent of the trip – but then, with an elevation drop of over 2,000 metres as we plummeted down to the Iranian border, my front brake had magically returned to service by the time we reached the valley floor, pedalled along the river, and found the guesthouse in Meghri that signified the end of Bikepacking Armenia.</p>

<p>So what did I learn from all of this? More pertinently, was my decision to upcycle an old, obsolete mountain bike for such a tough endeavour a wise&nbsp;one?</p>



<p>In the end – and <a href="https://tomsbiketrip.com/we-were-not-born-talented-brave-fearless/">I’ve written about this before</a> – it’s about your wit, not your kit. By definition, on an adventure, your circle of control is limited: you can do all the planning and preparation you like, but in the end you have to submit to the whims of the world and deal with what’s thrown at&nbsp;you.</p>

<p>There is a spectrum of preparedness, I think, on which different individuals feel comfortable at different points. And where you fall tends to be related to the level of confidence which will allow you to <em>begin</em> the endeavour in question – the point at which you accept that you’ve done all you reasonably can and <em>just go</em>.</p>



<p>Over the years, I feel I’ve traversed much of this spectrum, from excessive over-planning on my early trips to somewhere near the other end, where I am more or less happy to grab what’s lying around, walk out the door, and see what happens.</p>



<p>What happened on this trip illustrated that gradual change in attitude quite neatly. On one hand, my obsessive attention to detail when building the original bike paid off when, over a decade later, so many things went wrong, as I was able to fix the problems on the roadside or with a quick dash to the nearest bike&nbsp;shop.</p>



<p>On the other hand, it was making peace with uncertainty later on that allowed me to reappropriate this trusty old bike for a task that was – quite honestly – way beyond its designed capabilities, and ultimately to complete the expedition alongside riders on much ‘better’ bikes.</p>

<p>So now, in retrospect, and with more bikepacking trips coming up – <em>do I actually need another new&nbsp;bike?</em></p>



<p><strong>Honestly? I still don’t&nbsp;know…</strong></p>
