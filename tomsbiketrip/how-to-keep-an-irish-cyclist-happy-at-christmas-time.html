<h1>How To Keep An Irish Cyclist Happy At Christmas Time</h1>
<p>As any cycle-tourist will tell you, feeding a cycle tourist is no easy task. The demands of a stomach that processes a minimum of 5,000 calories per day must not be underestimated — indeed, such needs can often be a source of great embarassment for the hungry cyclist when invited in at the end of the day and presented with a portion sized for a mere mortal.</p>
<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="Masters of campcraft" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4244154026/"><img class="alignnone" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4244154026_0695e11c3d_z.jpg?w=580" alt="Masters of campcraft" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Last Christmas I was staying in Yerevan, Armenia, and I had the pleasure of hosting two very hungry cyclists — Fearghal and Simon of Revolution Cycle, the journey which they triumphantly and heroically completed earlier this year. The lads were expecting the full traditional Christmas spread — as well they should, after detouring so many hundreds of kilometres through the snowy mountains on the sole promise of mince-pies — and it was clear that this would be a truly formidable challenge.<span style="font-size: 13.1944px;"><!--more--><br>
</span></p>
<p>Finding both a turkey and a goose was my top priority, for which I had to travel to the meat bazaar at the other end of Yerevan, there being no Tesco and thus no deep-freeze aisle in Armenia. When I got the scraggly, non-factory-farmed, normally-proportioned specimens home, I found that they were freshly slaughtered, with all limbs and innards present and correct, and with only a token effort having been made at plucking. Luckily the chaps weren’t around to spectate as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4229190412/in/set-72157622977866705/">preparation ensued</a>, else they might not have&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4229193028/in/set-72157622977866705/">eaten so voraciously</a>.</p>
<p>No Christmas is complete without mince pies, but Armenia has no mince pies. Making them couldn’t be too difficult — or so I thought. It occurred to me that I hadn’t the slightest idea how to make even mincemeat. A little research indicated I’d need suet, which is the solid fat from the area around the kidneys of a cow. It looked like the meat market would need a second visit.</p>
<p>I located the aforementioned kidney fat from a man who was sitting on a stool on the roadside, surrounded by blood and heads, with a big plastic tub in front of him which was full of all the parts of a cow that nobody else wanted. He sold me a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4228409295/in/set-72157622977866705/">big stringy pile of the stuff</a> for next to nothing. Apparently, he said, it’s used in folk medicine here to cure cetain ailments. (Most healthcare in Armenia seems to be based on faith alone — unsurprising if you’ve ever seen the inside of a municipal clinic).</p>
<p>Back home I pulled the lumps of fat apart and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4229176730/in/set-72157622977866705/">put them in a pan to render</a> — which is to melt all the liquid fat and strain it from the supporting tissue. A few hours later, the flat smelled like a kebab house at 2am on a Sunday morning,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4229177886/in/set-72157622977866705/">but I had my suet</a>.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4228413755/in/set-72157622977866705/">mincemeat</a> was pretty simple after that — dried fruit, chopped nuts, sugar and spice; and cognac, for which Armenia is famous in a large part due to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ararat_%28brandy%29">Winston Churchhill having a taste for the stuff</a>. It’s so good that France has even allowed the Ararat Brandy Company to use the French word ‘cognac’ to describe its product — strange but&nbsp;true.</p>
<p>Shortcrust pastry asks for lard, and who the hell was I to substitute mere margarine in its place? Back to the meat market for a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4228416095/in/set-72157622977866705/">giant lump of pig fat</a> and a repeat of the rendering process, only with the flat smelling like a bacon-frying festival rather than a chip shop. But as we all agreed,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4228420481/in/set-72157622977866705/">the end result</a> was well worth the effort — and there were enough ingredients left to make a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4228414495/in/set-72157622977866705/">Christmas pud</a> as&nbsp;well!</p>
<p><a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="Tucking into Christmas dinner" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/4229196998/"><img class="alignnone" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4229196998_7911c173e3_z.jpg?w=580" alt="Tucking into Christmas dinner" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Through trying to recreate our traditional Christmas meal in a far-off land, I’d discovered more about what goes into our festive foods than I could have imagined, now that these items come off the supermarket shelf in nicely-designed boxes. I encourage everyone to have a go at putting traditional food together in the traditional way — it’s a great education, and all that work just makes the final result taste so much better. Especially if you’re a cyclist.<span id="pty_trigger"></span></p>
