<h1>New Adventures, Creative Projects and Commitments for&nbsp;2014</h1>
<p>Part One of this ‘annual review’ blog series was a <a title="2013: Retrospection &amp; Prioritisation" href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/2013-retrospection-a-re-statement-of-priorities-and-relocation/">critical retrospective of 2013</a>, based on looking at&nbsp;what went well and what didn’t go well. Part Two was a reminder of <a title="“Did you ever think that this would become your life?”" href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/did-you-ever-think-that-this-would-become-your-life/">how this blog came to be</a> and how it developed into what it is today, 7 years&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>This is the third and final part, in which I’ll be looking specifically at what 2014 has in store along the various strands of my life. It is worth regularly pausing for thought in this way, even if only to confirm that the direction we’re going in reflects our true priorities. The festive season provides ample opportunity to do so, and I’d encourage you to do the same, taking one final moment to establish where you’d actually like to be a year from now before the world of work sucks us all back in. (This happens to self-employed adventurers too).</p>
<h3>Adventures</h3>
<p>Practicing and promoting an adventurous ethos for life is at the absolute core of what I do. In less than a month’s time I’ll be leaving on a brand new journey, and I’ve dropped a number of mildly irritating hints over the last few weeks as to what it might consist of.</p>
<p>I have not yet discussed any ‘official announcement’ plans with my partner for the trip, so please do excuse me once again if I am necessarily vague; however I can confirm that it’ll involve returning to Iran for a fifth time, that the journey will be human-powered but will <em>not</em> be by bicycle, that my core objective is to put <a title="My 2013 New Year's Resolution, or قصد سال جدید من" href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/my-2013-new-years-resolution/">last year’s resolution</a> to the ultimate test… and that it’ll be bloody freezing! Here’s a photograph I received yesterday from a friend in Esfahan:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5815" alt="DSCN0197" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomsbiketrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DSCN0197-720x404.jpg?resize=580%2C325" width="580" height="325"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>It has to be said that — despite living in the Lake District — 2013 was rather thin on the ground in terms of substantial adventures, and I can feel the effect of this on my mind and body. So during the coming year I’m making a commitment to myself to get out&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Sod it, let’s put a figure on this: <em>I hereby commit to spending a minimum of 3 of the next 12 months on the road, in whatever form it might take, including at least one respectably sized bike&nbsp;trip.</em></p>
<p>There. You can hold me to&nbsp;that.</p>
<h3>Tom’s Bike&nbsp;Trip</h3>
<p>In the Part Two of this series last week I wrote of my objectives for this&nbsp;blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…through storytelling (inspiration), the sharing of knowledge (information) and attempting to serve people’s needs (creating action), my aim has simply become to get more people out travelling by bike — and to have fun doing&nbsp;it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>My mission for the blog remains this: <em>to get more people out travelling by bike</em>. What’s going to change is the way in which I approach that mission.</p>
<p>The <a title="Cycle-Touring Planning Resources &amp; Advice" href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/advice-planning/">resources</a> section of this site will see a major overhaul and expansion, reflecting the fact that it has grown beyond a mere handful of how-to articles. This’ll be happening sooner rather than later; it’s the time of year when we’re starting to dream up big plans for the summer (apologies as always to the antipodeans amongst you), and I’m keen to get this part of the site ship-shape in good&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>I’ll continue to tell tales of adventure, but I’ll be focussing on doing so in a more sustainable way than simple blogs, photographs and short videos.&nbsp;Longer-form storytelling, in whatever medium, has proved more rewarding and ultimately more effective than ‘trip blogs’ themselves, which tend to be published and then lost forever in the archives. Going forward, the blog will serve the purpose of drawing attention to timeless long-form creations.</p>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>Directly complementing the resources section will be the launch of my second book, which will be nothing at all like the <a href="http://j.mp/Zrh1j9" target="_blank">first</a>.</p>
<p>It’ll be a guide-style book, focusing in detail on one very particular aspect of bike trip planning — one that I get asked about more than any other. It will be of particular use to those who’ve already got trip plans bubbling away for the coming year, and (if I do my job well) it will also become a very useful resource for newcomers in the future.</p>
<p>Ironically, the topic is one that I’ve often said gets far more attention than it deserves. This digital-only ebook is being written in response to that, offering perspective to those who feel that they’re getting bogged down in a needlessly complicated area of bike trip preparation. The result of reading it will be confidence in decision-making, followed by the ability to move on to more exciting things (such as leaving).</p>
<p>I’m planning the public launch of the ebook for early April, but I’ll be making it <em>exclusively available to members of my mailing list</em> for a very limited time window at the end of January (and at a significant discount — told you there were benefits to joining!).</p>
<p>This is primarily because I <em>will</em> have finished creating the guide by then, and I want it to start being useful as soon as possible, <em>but</em> I’d rather not attempt to administrate a big public launch and all of the emails and questions that come with it while on an expedition in&nbsp;Iran!</p>
<p>If you’re not on the list and you do want to get early access, you’re <a href="http://eepurl.com/hoxPQ" target="_blank">welcome to sign up now</a> — just make sure you do so before the end of the month when the announcement will be&nbsp;made.</p>
<p>(By the way, if you read the article last autumn about my next writing project — working title ‘How To Free Your Inner Adventurer’ — you may well be wondering what became of it. As I worked on the project, things became rather confused and haphazard, and it soon became clear that a single book could not do justice to the sheer scope of the topic. I finally elected to break the scope down and devote one book to each major subdivision. This ebook is the first in the series, and the one I felt would be the best to get out into the world&nbsp;first.)</p>
<h3>Filmmaking</h3>
<p>January 28th 2014 will see the official launch of <a href="http://janapar.com/?from=eccbc87e4b5ce2fe28308fd9f2a7baf3" target="_blank"><em>Janapar</em></a> on iTunes and several other global video-on-demand platforms, just over a year after our own independent launch of the film. I’ll be in London that week to do some publicity, and then I’ll be heading directly for Iran (they can’t get to me&nbsp;there!).</p>
<p>This is as big a step towards ‘mainstream’ as the project will ever take, and in terms of personal ambition is far beyond anything I’ve ever been interested in. Ultimately, however, the film itself does not belong to me, even if the story does, and there are other people and ambitions involved in this decision.</p>
<p>I’m unsure what (if any) response to expect, but what it <em>really</em> means, to my mind, is that <em>Janapar</em>’s future&nbsp;will be out of my hands, still doing what it was made to do, only doing it elsewhere. Meanwhile, I’ll be able crack on with something entirely new!</p>
<p>There are currently two new film projects on the table for which the footage has already been shot, and two more potential films at the development stage. I’m still unsure which of these will see the light of day this year, but I’m committing to <em>directing and producing at least one of them by the end of 2014</em>.</p>
<p>As with so many big leaps in life, perfect circumstances do not exist, but having spent several years now shooting film footage of my adventures I feel that it’s time I took the leap and attempted full-on directorship of a feature film.</p>
<p>I find filmmaking a more enjoyable creative process than writing, but it generally requires resources and collaboration far beyond a quiet room and a laptop to create something of real substance, and that commitment really does require a story worth telling.</p>
<p>Finding the next story, then, is the first step in deciding which of these potential projects to press forward with. That’s a work-in-progress.</p>
<h3>‘Life’</h3>
<p>In my roles as husband, son, friend and family member, I feel that I can do much better this year.&nbsp;Financial stress caused some problems in 2013, as I <a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/2013-retrospection-a-re-statement-of-priorities-and-relocation/">explained previously</a>.&nbsp;My biggest commitment for the year in this sense is to do more than simply subsist, to ensure that creativity is not stifled by stress, and to be able to invest in people and projects I care&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>Specifically, many of my travels later in 2014 will be concerned with re-establishing links that have been neglected or lost. I recently met up with Mark, one of my original cycling partners for <em>Ride Earth</em>. It was the first time I’d seen him since he left the expedition in Budapest six years ago. He’s since emigrated to New Zealand, and within minutes it seemed we’d hatched a plot for adventures in Lord-of-the-Rings land.</p>
<p>And I’m often asked if Tenny and I have plans for future travels together. Typically for diasporan Armenians, she has extended family all over the world. We’re planning an extended journey for 2014/2015; one which will be broadly based around finding them. That’s as far as we’ve got, but the seed has been&nbsp;sown.</p>
<p>I’ve always said that I’ll keep travelling for as long as it remains personally relevant. These plans are a reflection of that concept. Watch this&nbsp;space.</p>
<p><strong>2014 beckons: Onwards and upwards! (And don’t forget to <a href="http://eepurl.com/hoxPQ" target="_blank">get on the mailing list</a> — things always happen there&nbsp;first!)</strong><span id="pty_trigger"></span></p>
