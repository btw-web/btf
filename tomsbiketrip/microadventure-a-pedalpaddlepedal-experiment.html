<h1>Microadventure: A Pedal/Paddle/Pedal Experiment</h1>
<p>I must have misread the map, because the road to Pilton turned out to be a rutted bridleway. No chance of riding the road bike down there, I thought, so I continued along the narrow country lane, knowing that sooner or later I’d reach the River Nene anyway.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/5857265197/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/2753/5857265197_50b0bf68a9.jpg?resize=500%2C339&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bikerafting experiment: Floating 1" width="500" height="339"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>The plan was extremely simple: cycle to a river, float down it, ride home.<!--more--> It would be the first time I’d paddled a watercraft since a school trip when I was 10, so it wouldn’t be anything earth-shaking, and I still hadn’t shaken off the nasty infection that had taken me out a few weeks previously. But it would be a proof of concept, at least — first-hand evidence of the feasibility of a bike-rafting trip.</p>
<p>I arrived in the cute market-town of Oundle and headed south. Before long I noticed a lock and set off down a track towards it. A handful of stern-looking Sunday boaters chugged past and ignored me from behind their sunglasses. Yawn.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/5857254615/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/3177/5857254615_bdd913d80b_z.jpg?resize=465%2C640&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bikerafting experiment: Ready to go" width="465" height="640"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>The portage point was the ideal put-in spot — a few inches above the water below the lower gate of the lock. Hoping that nobody would ask to see an Environment Agency permit or British Canoeists’ Union license, I inflated the raft I’d packed into a single pannier, slotted the paddle together, strapped the wheels and frame to the front of the little dinghy — and bobbed magically out into midstream. Amazing! Ha-haaa! Seamless transfer from roadway to waterway, without a&nbsp;trace!</p>
<p>My packraft felt more stable with a bit of weight on the bow to counterbalance it. Paddling the thing was so easy. I was impressed. I drifted along with the current until the river widened and I slowed almost to a halt. I was travelling through wheat-fields and cow pastures now. A narrow-boat sidled past in the other direction, the steersman grinning curiously at me as I waited for him to&nbsp;pass.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/5857262599/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/5270/5857262599_62a1f11ddc.jpg?resize=500%2C328&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bikerafting experiment: Floating 2" width="500" height="328"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>It was no kayak, I discovered. The boat skidded across the water’s surface rather than cutting through it. Without constant adjustment I quickly found myself pirouetting downriver. Big deal — that’s what the paddle was for. I could hardly complain — the entire package of boat, seat, straps, inflation bag, paddle and carry sack all weighed in at three-and-a-half kilos, or the same as a couple of big water bottles.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/5857259353/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/3193/5857259353_71af8a6c67.jpg?resize=500%2C375&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bikerafting experiment: Luggage setup" width="500" height="375"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>The Nene was placid and — let’s be honest — fairly boring. After an hour and a half of steady flat-water paddling between reeds and trees and past motionless anglers I reached the next lock down. The river might as well have been a canal. Still, I could think of worse ways to spend a Sunday.</p>
<p>I fetched up by the portage point and disembarked, having completed my first packrafting experience without capsizing or, more likely, falling overboard whilst trying to get out of the boat.&nbsp;Yay!</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tom-allen/5857270333/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/5105/5857270333_093c12607d.jpg?resize=500%2C329&#038;ssl=1" alt="Bikerafting experiment: Reassembling the bike" width="500" height="329"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Now to find a river more interesting than the&nbsp;Nene…</p>
<p><em>P.S. The boat is an <a href="http://alpackarafts.com/product/denali-llama/" target="_blank">Alpacka Denali Llama</a> with a <a href="http://alpackarafts.com/product/manta-ray-fiberglass/" target="_blank">Manta Ray fibreglass paddle</a>. They definitely aren’t cheap, but you get what you pay&nbsp;for…</em></p>
