<h1>How To Fly With A Bike For Free, In Business Class, For The Price Of An Economy Ticket</h1>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly. It is possible to&nbsp;upgrade an economy flight ticket for free to&nbsp;business class, and get free bicycle carriage into the bargain.&nbsp;Pretty good,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>This lunacy&nbsp;is a&nbsp;classic&nbsp;example of <strong>travel hacking</strong>. I’ve been experimenting with its various techniques for the last year or so, and I’d like to share what I’ve learned — specifically, I’d like to share how best to put these techniques to use in the context of cycle touring.</p>
<h3>What Is Travel Hacking?</h3>
<p>Put simply, travel hacking is the art &amp; science of getting for free (or cheap) what would normally be a significant travel expense — flights and hotel rooms being the most common.</p>
<p>It’s usually done by carefully exploiting promotional offers made by credit card companies in partnership with major airlines and hotel chains.</p>
<p>These offers are designed, of course, to sucker the spender&nbsp;into the shackles of debt.&nbsp;Played correctly, however, travel hacking is&nbsp;a particularly satisfying form of <strong>consumer revenge</strong>, and a money-saving one at&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<h3>A Basic Example Of Travel Hacking</h3>
<p>Last year I signed up for a British Airways credit card. I have no debts (other than a student loan) and thus a&nbsp;good credit record, so acceptance was a breeze.</p>
<p>The sign-up bonus at the time required that I&nbsp;spend a fairly meagre £750 on the card within 3 months — about the cost&nbsp;of a new low-end touring bike.</p>
<p>Having done so by moving all of my spending to the card until the target was reached, then paying it off in full, I&nbsp;received&nbsp;15,000 ‘Avios’ points with&nbsp;British Airways’ frequent flyer network, the <a href="http://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/executive-club" target="_blank">Executive Club</a>. (I didn’t actually get on a plane at&nbsp;all.)</p>
<p>Then I cut the card it in half and closed the account, 15,000 airmiles richer at no cost whatsoever.</p>
<p>15,000 such&nbsp;airmiles, it turns out, can be redeemed for two flights on pretty much any Western European route flown by&nbsp;BA — for example, Munich, from where Tenny and I returned after our last&nbsp;cycling&nbsp;adventure on the continent this summer.&nbsp;Not just that, but it covered&nbsp;two <em>business class</em> flights.</p>
<p>Why waste the points on business class? There’s a very good reason. There’s the extra legroom, edible meals, queue-jumping at all points in the boarding process, and access to swanky business lounges (full of free booze &amp; food) at the airports, where you may loaf for hours while grinning smugly at people&nbsp;in smart suits who’re wondering who let <em>you</em> in.</p>
<p>But the <em>real</em> bonus for the cycle tourist is the <strong>doubled hold luggage allowance</strong>.&nbsp;Since British Airways don’t charge extra for bicycle as part of your luggage allowance, that meant both our bikes and all our touring gear flew home from Munich with us for free as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>So that few minutes&nbsp;time spent signing up for and administrating the credit card is saving us a couple of hundred pounds on return flights for our tour, <em>and</em> getting us upgraded into the bargain.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ll agree that’s&nbsp;a pretty good trade-off. Particularly if, like me, you glean a disproportionate amount of pleasure from circumventing the ‘system’.</p>
<h3>Getting Started With Travel Hacking</h3>
<p>Relatively speaking, ours was&nbsp;a very puny beginners’ attempt at travel hacking.</p>
<p>But it’s a hobby for a surprising number of people, who sign up for several cards a year, claim the bonuses, and employ various other hacks to receive hundreds of thousands of airmiles while&nbsp;not actually flying <em>anywhere</em>.</p>
<p>US residents in particular have it made.&nbsp;The signup incentives are so ludicrous that there are even <a href="http://unconventionalguides.com/cmd.php?af=1476907" target="_blank">professional guides</a>* available to help folk make sense of it&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>But the possibilities are growing for those of us based in the UK to game the system in the same way.&nbsp;This is particularly true if you’re a couple and you’ve both got significant purchases coming up (touring bikes and gear, for example), as it doubles your ability to meet these signup bonus criteria.</p>
<p>Deals change frequently, but the best such hack&nbsp;currently available in the UK is on the American Express Preferred Rewards Gold&nbsp;card, whose signup bonus alone (20,000 points) is enough for a free return flight to Istanbul.</p>
<p>Simply use the card&nbsp;to buy your touring gear (by spending&nbsp;£2,000 within three months), pay it off in full (it’s a charge card, so you have to anyway), cancel the card (to avoid the £125 annual fee from the second year onwards), and enjoy your free flights. Job’s a good ‘un!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/uk/content/gold-card/" target="_blank">Here’s the signup link</a>. Play it sensibly and you’ll be well rewarded.</p>
<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>So there’s my quick intro to travel hacking — a.k.a. getting free flights thrown in with your&nbsp;new touring gear.</p>
<p>There’s a whole subculture of travel hackers out there, and if you’ve got the time and resources to make it a regular hobby, it won’t take long to rack up the requisite points for free or heavily discounted flights much further afield.</p>
<p>If you’re in the UK, the best and most up-to-date ‘travel hacking’&nbsp;resource I’ve found is <a href="http://www.headforpoints.com/" target="_blank">HeadForPoints.com</a>. In the USA, <a href="http://cardsfortravel.com/" target="_blank">CardsForTravel.com</a> is a good place to&nbsp;start.</p>
<p>Of course, with multiple cards on the go, this&nbsp;quickly becomes game of shifting money around, which can get a bit complex if you’re not on the ball. So if you’re financially illiterate, it’s probably best to steer clear. Don’t say I didn’t warn&nbsp;you…<span id="pty_trigger"></span></p>
