<p>Now that I&#8217;ve spent about 1500km touring, Bikepacking and mountain biking with Red I think its fair to make an initial assessment of the choices I made and share my thought processes for this self build.</p>
<p>To read about how I originally &#8221; rescued&#8221; the frame that would become Red click <a title="Dragons, bicycles and life" href="http://www.shanecycles.com/dragons-bicycles-and-life/" target="_blank">&gt;here&lt;</a></p>
<p><strong>Aim of the project:</strong></p>
<p>After several long tours on and off road in recent years, I was ready to see what this Bikepacking non-sense is all about and maybe try some moutainbiking. Therefore I wanted a bike that I could use for both. A second hand mountainbike would of been the logical choice but I found I&#8217;d be making too many compromises buying second hand as I had a number of thought as to what would make the perfect Bikepacking bike for me. I wasn&#8217;t too interested in a 29er or 27er either because I have that touring blood that still wants interchangeability with local bikes if I get stuck somewhere in a far off land. Ultimately I ended up getting my hands on a very nice steel frame (Reynolds 853) that had originally been hand built by <a href="http://www.m-gineering.nl">M-gineering</a> as an off road tourer(slightly longer wheelbase than a standard MTB, not to mention the details that only a bike spotter can see).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/red.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1384" src="http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/red.jpg" alt="red" width="1200" height="701" srcset="http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/red.jpg 1200w, http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/red-860x502.jpg 860w, http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/red-1024x598.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0888.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1381" src="http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0888.jpg" alt="IMG_0888" width="1200" height="900" srcset="http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0888.jpg 1200w, http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0888-860x645.jpg 860w, http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0888-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p>The frame is in theory slightly too big for me but this means a lot of real estate for frame bags (<a href="http://www.shanecycles.com/make-your-own-gear-myog-bikepacking-frame-bag/">which I made myself</a>). With a short handle bar stem I was able to get reasonable geometry for both mountain biking and off road touring.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0938.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1383" src="http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0938.jpg" alt="IMG_0938" width="1200" height="900" srcset="http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0938.jpg 1200w, http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0938-860x645.jpg 860w, http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0938-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Components I chose and why: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Fork</strong> : Rockshox Reba</p>
<p>This is generally accepted as a reliable touring fork and is <em>fairly</em> lightweight, with space for 2.4&#8243; tires.</p>
<p><strong>Front wheel </strong>: Exal DC19 rim/Shimano XT M756 hub (steel spindle)</p>
<p>Handbuilt by <a href="http://equilibrium-wielbouw.nl">Equilibrium</a> where I get many of my wheels built. This rim/hub combination gives a fairly bombproof wheel for the weight, I wouldn&#8217;t want a lighter rim for touring. Another important issue is to get one of the old XT hub models that still has a steel spindle rather than the modern (too) light aluminium ones.</p>
<p><strong>Rear wheel </strong>: Rohloff hub with Sputnik rim (borrowed from <a href="http://www.shanecycles.com/bikes-mr-hyde/" target="_blank">Mr Hyde</a> and added a disc) </p>
<p>The rim is obviously on the heavy side for a mountain bike and at some point I&#8217;ll change the rim if I&#8217;m convinced that this wheel is staying with Red, for now its useable on 2 bikes by installing/removing the brake disc. Using a Rohloff is a no brainer if you already have one. Its slightly heavier than a derailleur setup but brings so many advantages that its worth that little extra weight in my opinion. Luckily when I bought my Rohloff hub in 2009 I had the foresight to buy one that is disc ready.</p>
<p><strong>Brakes</strong>: BB7 disc 180mm front/ 160mm rear</p>
<p>BB7 is a disc brake operated by a cable, this seems to me to be the perfect combination of reliability, braking power and convenience for on road maintenance. I&#8217;m not used to having so much braking power and it was great fun 🙂 The ease of adjusting the brake pads and the lack of hydraulics are a big bonus in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Saddle</strong> : Brooks Cambium</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a through and through brooks fan so thought I&#8217;d give the new lightweight and waterproof rubberised version of their leather saddles a try. I&#8217;m not that impressed, in 30,000km+ my bum has never been so sore while cycling.</p>
<p><strong>Bars/ Seat post : </strong> : KCNC Ti Pro Lite</p>
<p>Random lightweight stuff( and not Ti) . The bolts on the seat post seem a little thin, fingers cross my fat arse doesn&#8217;t break them. I also have Ergo handlebar grips on the bars which I stole off my Brompton for the Spain trip.</p>
<p><strong>Tyres</strong> : Racing Ralph (not tubeless yet)</p>
<p>A nice lightweight tire that performed well with the mix of dirt, gravel, rocks and asphalt. I used 2.25&#8243; this time, next time I&#8217;ll go slightly wider. I can fit 2.4&#8243; in the front and close to 3&#8243; at the back. At some point I may do a (Ghetto) tubeless conversion too.</p>
<p><strong>Transmission</strong> : Surly stainless 36t, Rohloff 17t, singlespeed chain</p>
<p>The surly is a nice bombproof chainring and well worth the extra couple of grams. Nowadays 36&#215;17 is allowed by Rohloff (don&#8217;t tell them I&#8217;ve been using it for years) it gives an excellent low granny gear. </p>
<p><strong>Cranks,BB</strong> : Sugino square type 104 Bcd, Shimano Un55</p>
<p>I try to have all my bikes with same BCD and square drive for easy interchangeability and using up spare parts lying around my shed(Brompton excluded). The Shimano Un55 is a nice cheap BB and I usually get about 10-12,000km out of each unit before it fails. Though maybe 104 wasn&#8217;t the best size to choose as my default 🙂 </p>
<p><strong>Pedals</strong>: Shimano PD-A530 at home, Blackspire sub4 on the road</p>
<p>Shimano PD-A530 is a nice combi pedal(spd one side, flat on the other) that I&#8217;ve had on all my bikes at home for about the last year or so, not sure about how durable they are yet though.<br />
Blackspire sub4 Seems like a nice light weight alternative to the Wellgo platform pedals (heavier) I&#8217;ve used previously on longer trips.  Time will tell how these compare in durability.</p>
<p><strong>Rack</strong> : Tubus titan airy</p>
<p>Unlike many other Bikepackers I haven&#8217;t gone for a seatpost bag. I see no real advantage in having one. I have a hardtail bike so can use a rack. Using the 300g Titan Airy + a dry bag of 2-300g isn&#8217;t much heavier than a seat post bag but it is much more stable and has a slightly lower C of G plus the ability to carry that little extra food now and again. Admittedly a Tubus titan airy is far from cheap but it isn&#8217;t much more expensive than most seat posts bags (apparently Bikepacking is an expensive hobby if you buy commercially) My solution is more practical and certainly gives more versatility. </p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
<p>The bike weighs in at a non light-weight but respectable 14kg including rack and pedals. Knowing where the frame came from I had no problem jumping in at the deep end and cycling the Transandalucia despite only doing a couple of short test rides on a local MTB track. Red is a pleasure to ride on and off road, and light enough for this amateur to do some weekend mountain biking too. The only thing I may change in the short term is the saddle and the jury is still out whether I want a front fork with suspension while touring, even off road. When travelling light on remote hiking trails there&#8217;s something to be said for almost 1kg less fork and less maintenance worries if you have slightly fatter tires to save your wrists and forearms. Apart from that I&#8217;m still behind all the choices I made for this Bikepacking setup.</p>
<p>Despite robbing some parts off other bikes and parts lying around my shed I did buy a lot of new parts. Therefore this ended out being quite an expensive bike. But I think its fair to say I got the build about right first time, so have a wonderful Bikepacking machine for years to come. </p>
