<p>I&#8217;ve asked a dozen( more of a baker&#8217;s dozen or even a Shane&#8217;s dozen) of the cyclists I&#8217;ve followed or met in recent years to share their favorite blog post from their own website/blog. The irony and amusing part is the posts they&#8217;ve chosen are different to the ones I&#8217;d expected or the ones I would have chosen. Therefore its an interesting mix.</p>

Instead he chooses a post trip write up. Though in Swedish with a combination of google translate and photos his trips are an interesting read.

<p><strong>(Dutch)Lars de Wit: </strong>Lars is in my eyes one of those people that is a true traveller and adventurer. He has done some amazing trips, and each time goes back to work just long enough to gather cash for his next trip, while at home living a frugal and quiet life. He refuses to have a blog and hates facebook, but luckily since 2003 has been talked into giving updates on his trips via messages on the popular Dutch cycling forum <a title="http://www.wereldfietser.nl/" href="http://www.wereldfietser.nl/" target="_blank">De wereldfietser</a>. His amusing and always positive look on life is always a pleasure to read, as is his dodgy English 🙂 &#8230;&#8230;His most recent trips include <a title="http://www.wereldfietser.nl/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=5672" href="http://www.wereldfietser.nl/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=5672" target="_blank">Lars Goes Australia&#8217;s in 2007</a> ,<a title="http://www.wereldfietser.nl/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=11415" href="http://www.wereldfietser.nl/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=11415" target="_blank"> Lars goes Latin (America) 2009</a>, <a title="http://www.wereldfietser.nl/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;p=111288" href="http://www.wereldfietser.nl/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;p=111288" target="_blank">Yes I am, cycling to Cape Town 2010</a></p>
<p>Sadly during his recent trip : <a title="http://www.wereldfietser.nl/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=18134" href="http://www.wereldfietser.nl/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=18134" target="_blank">Lars&#8217; Revanche in the Andes</a> he faced his ultimate challenge. With his permission I&#8217;ve copied his text <strong>1</strong>. As it is a truly heroic story, <strong>2</strong>. As a warning to other cyclists and campers not to make the same stupid mistake. In theory it is common knowledge and common sense that you don&#8217;t camp in a dry river bed. But we&#8217;ve all done it&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<h3>BE WARNED!!!</h3>
<p><em>&#8220;50 km before San Pedro de Atacama I pitched my tent in a dry riverbed.</em><br />
<em> I didn´t think further, simple as that.</em><br />
<em> ( later I heard there&#8217;s only 20 mm of rainfall a year, normally )</em></p>
<p><em>This night was going to be far beyond normal &#8230;..</em></p>
<p><em>When I was reading, after dinner, in my tent, I heard noise, a rumbling noise and I felt the ground moving a little bit, like with an earthquake.</em><br />
<em> I was thinking at first maybe a truck passing by but the sound stayed.</em><br />
<em> So I looked out of my tent and was shocked at what I saw, the right side of the former dry river, there was a very strong and fast movement of water, mud and stones.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh boy, no good I thought, I have to get out of here and started like crazy to pack my bags. </em><em>But halfway the water was already under my tent so I left my tent, first saved my bike by bringing it to a higher part in the riverbed ( later it was found there, if only I would have stayed there too but no &#8230;. ) got back to my tent for my bags, grabbed 4 of them, waded through ankle deep water to the higher parts where my bike lay down safe and then tried to cross the enormous stream, with my bags, to the other side ( only 6 meters ) but you already guessed, I guess, The water / mud grabbed me&#8230;</em><br />
<em> So I was dragged down the river and looked death into his eyes.</em><br />
<em> I tried to stay flat and breathe but sometimes was dragged under for several seconds, spinning around.</em><br />
<em> At one point I thought, ok, maybe I will not survive this and die. Fine&#8230;..But if I have something to say NOT by drowning.</em></p>
<p>That seemed such a bad way to go.<br />
So I fought and fought, mud in my eyes, ears, mouth, even lungs ( later I coughed some little stones up ) and managed to keep above.</p>
<p><em>After 2 or 3 horrible kilometers like that I finally managed to crawl to the land and lay down.</em><br />
<em> Now, in the water I allready had seen my right leg in a strange angle.</em><br />
<em> Heavily broken.</em></p>
<p><em>In the water I lost my glasses so I could´t see.</em><br />
<em> Dark.</em><br />
<em> Raining a little.</em><br />
<em> So cold.</em><br />
<em> Not knowing where to go ( and how, I couldn´t walk ! )</em><br />
<em> Some lights around me, far far away &#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>So I just lay there and wanted to die, I didn´t see other solutions anymore &#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>But it was so cold and I thought of my family.</em><br />
<em> I thought, no Lars, you cannot do that to them, maybe they will never find you here and that uncertainty, I just couldn´t do that to them.</em><br />
<em> I guess my love for my family saved me&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>So I started to crawl , sort of following the river.</em><br />
<em> 500m crawling and then lay down for a while.</em><br />
<em> 500m more</em><br />
<em> and so on, and so on.</em><br />
<em> With a severely broken leg, on bare hands and bare knees, through a sandy, rocky area.</em><br />
<em> Oh it was so painful.</em></p>
<p><em>Later I found out I crawled for 7 hours until finally police found me ( well, I was crawling to their patrol car lights ) and I was saved.</em></p>
<p><em>But unfortunately they cannot save my leg.</em></p>
<p><em>Greetings Lars&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Lars spent the coming months in a hospital in Chili having several operations to try and fix the multiple fractures in his ankle and to clean out all the wounds. Sadly he ended up with a nasty bacterial infection that resulted in the removal of a couple of toes, later amputation just below the knee then another one at the knee.</p>
<p>Now back in the Netherlands he&#8217;s on the road to recovery and still his amazing positive self,  now working on walking again and with plans to cycle again as soon as possible.  As an insight to his frame of mind he recently posted an update of &#8221; my release date from hospital is getting closer, as is the end of my leg (they took another 6&#8243; off yesterday).&#8221;</p>
<p>Lars I take my sweat stained, dust filled hat off to your courage and determination&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>For those interested, this is how a flash flood goes&#8230;..</p>

<p>Update 2016:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve once again met up with Lars for a few beers and he&#8217;s doing amazing. He&#8217;s now walking normally and without a walking stick on his newest bionic leg. Does a full time voluntary job at an animal shelter. Last year cycled in America and plans to head to Spain soon to cycle in the mountains. The crazy thing is, despite only having 1 and 1/4 leg, and hardly travelling light he still aims to cycle around 100km a day, just like the old days&#8230;</p>
<p>MY HERO!!!<br />
The human body is an amazing thing when backed up by an amazing mind.</p>
