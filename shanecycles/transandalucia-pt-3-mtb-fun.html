<h1>Transandalucia pt 3 MTB fun</h1>
<p>My rest day in Ronda had me refreshed, and happy to have taken a hotel as the Spanish weather was anything but Spanish (but what can one expect in early February). Being in a tourist town was also a refreshing break from making a fool of myself with my 10 Spanish words every time I wanted a meal.</p>
<p>The morning ride was a cheeky 600m ride up to Puerto de Lifa.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_1080.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1325" src="http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_1080-860x645.jpg" alt="IMG_1080" width="860" height="645" srcset="http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_1080-860x645.jpg 860w, http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_1080-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://www.shanecycles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_1080.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></a></p>
<p>Followed by a much cheekier 600m descent from Puerto de Lifa on some challenging singletrack, a little river crossing and some lovely scenery.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1092 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/16602607891"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8561/16602607891_efff0231b7_b.jpg" alt="IMG_1092" width="1000" height="750" /></a></p>
<p>This was much more of what I&#8217;d expected from the Transandalucia. Despite my lack of MTB experience the white knuckle descent was generally do-able with only the occasion bit of walking down hill. Probably about as much fun as you can have with your clothes on.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1093 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/16603153822"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8669/16603153822_bc326fa469_b.jpg" alt="IMG_1093" width="1000" height="750" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_1095 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15981606974"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8681/15981606974_df6c24ffd5_b.jpg" alt="IMG_1095" width="1000" height="750" /></a></p>
<p>The river crossing would be a great place for a picnic in Spring or Summer, but at 3 degrees on a sunny winters day I thought it best to just push on and stay warm. The next 450m climb the ideal way to stay warm.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1096 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/16603778335"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8655/16603778335_85977b9b8a_b.jpg" alt="IMG_1096" width="1000" height="750" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_1098 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/16416580698"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8647/16416580698_0f0f43f195_b.jpg" alt="IMG_1098" width="1000" height="750" /></a></p>
<p>The coming hours I climbed through olive groves then I zoomed the 600m downhill over the last 8km to Ardales with a super tailwind just as a storm approached. Being the softy I am I once again took refuge in a hotel for the night. Spain is one of the few countries I&#8217;ve travelled in where its still possible to get a single room. At €20 B+B and a three course meal for €10 I was very happy to be indoors and miss the storm.</p>
<p>The next day brought a series of short climbs up the the reservoir above El chorro and stunning rugged views of this beautiful part of Spain.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1114 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/16603153112"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8617/16603153112_914df620aa_b.jpg" alt="IMG_1114" width="1000" height="750" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_1115 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/16416580258"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8601/16416580258_9f2736b591_b.jpg" alt="IMG_1115" width="1000" height="750" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_1117 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/16602606621"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8589/16602606621_307044e841_b.jpg" alt="IMG_1117" width="768" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>And what goes up, must come down. I had no idea going downhill could be such hard work. The 350m drop in less than 2km was heavy on the wrists to say the least. Sadly the photo&#8217;s don&#8217;t do this awesome goat track justice. Stretches like this are when you really feel the difference of a sleek backpacking set up rather than bulky panniers snagging on rocks and trees.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1121 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/16577800106"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8674/16577800106_3515eda56f_b.jpg" alt="IMG_1121" width="768" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_1122 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/16416579358"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8647/16416579358_5a73fe059f_b.jpg" alt="IMG_1122" width="768" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>I pushed on to Antequera that day and arrived broken after another day with 1500m climbing.</p>
<p>The beautiful morning ride out of Antequera was spoiled with a puncture moment, not a problem usually, but with cold hands and tyres covered in mud and gravel, it took me a couple of attempts to fix the puncture properly, you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d be better at this by now. Though the backpacking set up did save a lot of hassle compared to panniers.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1132 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/16603776585"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8635/16603776585_746f9237e8_b.jpg" alt="IMG_1132" width="1000" height="750" /></a></p>
<p>The afternoon brought more climbing, scenery and my first glimpse of things to come.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_1136 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/16602604941"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8655/16602604941_0bb56db7f7_b.jpg" alt="IMG_1136" width="1000" height="750" /></a></p>
<p>I once again arrived in town tired, broken and cold as I peddled into Ventas de Zafarraya marking the end of the Malaga stage of the Transandalucia and another day with 1500m of climbing. I turned up to the small hotel in town just as the restaurant was closing and asked about a room. Apparently the hotel was actually closed but with a little smiling, looking pathetic and a little smooth talking by the barmaid on my behalf to her boss, I was allowed to take room for €15 if I was prepared to let myself out without breakfast in the morning&#8230;..Deal.</p>
<p>After a quick shower I hobbled next door to the pizza place. The waitress in her best &#8216;you stupid tourist&#8217; Spanish tried to explain that two kebab burrito&#8217;s is an aweful lot of food for a skinny lad. I insisted that I was very hungry so did want two. Twenty minutes later she looked very disappoint as I handed over two empty plates and asks for the dessert menu. She&#8217;d obviously never met a hungry cyclist I guess.</p>
<p>Cheers to cyclists everywhere, and to our buffet destroying skills 🙂</p>

<p>Coming soon, cycling in Granada&#8230;..</p>
<p>Note : I haven’t included detailed info on the route or accommodation as both are very well covered by the data provided by the volunteers @ <a href="http://www.transandalus.es/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=6&amp;id=22&amp;Itemid=41&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">www.transandalus.org</a> (including Transandalucia GPS tracks)</p>
