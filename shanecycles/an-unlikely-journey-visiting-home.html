<h1>An unlikely journey : Visiting &#8221; Home&#8221;.</h1>
<p>I&#8217;d booked the Ijmuiden-Newcastle ferry a week earlier and hadn&#8217;t been disappointed by the price. After another summer season working more than I&#8217;d like to I was ready to hit the road again. Lacking inspiration, funds and interest for a far away or long trip I went for something closer to home and the fact I hadn&#8217;t visited my parents in over a year (shame on me) cycling in Northern England seemed like a great way to kill two magpies with one stone. I wasn&#8217;t convinced crossing the Pennines on a 2 speed Brompton would be one of my better ideas. But, what a great way to increase the adventure and challenge value of such a short and in theory simple trip.</p>
<p>The 35km ride (mainly on the LF1) to Ijmuiden on a beautiful dry Autumn day was a great start to the trip, and after a short cold wait I was allowed to board the ferry.</p>

<p><a title="IMG_0661 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15931041961"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7501/15931041961_b7afc3b5fd_b.jpg" alt="IMG_0661" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>
<p>Being the cheap cycle tourist that I am I chose not to enjoy the excellent onboard buffet dinner (€25+) and instead went for a healthy supermarket salad/beer combo in my room :). Then slowly fell asleep to the rock of the boat.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_0662 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15745568658"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8637/15745568658_88940a2ec8_b.jpg" alt="IMG_0662" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t cycling much in the UK since my childhood but riding on the right side (left) of the road was easy to get used to again. What wasn&#8217;t so easy to get used to after living in The Netherlands in recent years was how bad the cycle paths are in the UK. Sadly cycling infrastructure is the result of lobbying and hard work by nice charities like <a title="http://www.sustrans.org.uk" href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sustrans</a> rather than a structural solution by the government like in many other European countries.</p>
<p>The result is cycle paths that randomly start/stop (often after a couple of hundred meters), illogical routes and when you do finally find yourself on an off road cycle path, there&#8217;s a chance you&#8217;ll smash into a bus stop or road sign if you&#8217;re not paying attention&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="IMG_0666 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15310762684"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7519/15310762684_c6a8078f03_b.jpg" alt="IMG_0666" width="1024" height="768" /></a> Shame on you North Tyneside council, would it be so hard to put the bus shelter 2m further back?</p>
<p>Anyway, after the first couple of Km&#8217;s of crazy and often glass covered cycle paths or almost getting squashed by trucks I finally found the official start of the Hadrians cycleway which I followed to the Tyne bridges.</p>
<p><a title="Hadrians cycle route by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15745799528"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7498/15745799528_3daec77600_o.png" alt="Hadrians cycle route" width="348" height="396" /></a></p>
<p>Enroute it was interesting to see areas that in my childhood memories were industrial area&#8217;s and shit hole housing estates, are now marina&#8217;s and fancy bars, how things have changed along the once very smelly river Tyne.</p>
<p><a title="P1010752 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15931037011"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7489/15931037011_d56f2ee6e2_o.jpg" alt="P1010752" width="1200" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>It was interesting to arrive at the (for me) new Millennium bridge and enjoy the view of the other Tyne Bridges. This is where all my city adventures began as a small boy, now 30 years later the only thing I recognise are the bridges, everything else is gone or changed. Factories and shipyards have become apartment blocks, theatres, museums and fancy bars. Upgraded and changed forever and generally thats not a bad thing in this part of the world.</p>
<p><a title="P1010756 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15932345992"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8609/15932345992_5d51098569_o.jpg" alt="P1010756" width="1200" height="674" /></a></p>
<p><a title="P1010757 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15310757334"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8597/15310757334_29070c97b6_o.jpg" alt="P1010757" width="1200" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>At the Swing bridge I took the left and steep climb to Gateshead, my crunching knee&#8217;s indicating 2 gears may not be quite enough for the coming week, that hill was as steep as I&#8217;d remembered it to be.</p>
<p>Gateshead town centre had been a large part of my youth. Home of my primary school, hobby club, evening and weekends of mischief. I was quickly disappointed to see the old ugly 1960 concrete shopping center and <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Square,_Gateshead" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Square,_Gateshead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi storey car park</a> had been replaced by an ugly 21st century version.</p>
<p><a title="Gateshead Trinity Square Car Park by Gordon Barnes, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/geebee/2256382750"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2011/2256382750_9ae36705e9_z.jpg" alt="Gateshead Trinity Square Car Park" width="640" height="480" /></a><br />

<p>Cycling down Gateshead high street was like entering a zombie apocalypse. The ash grey faces of locals living through poverty, illness and inner city depression a stark reminder of what I escaped many years ago, and the sad face of many parts of the UK today.</p>
<p>The inconsequent cycle paths, diversions and riding along busy pothole roads and bus lanes continued until I arrived at my parents house for a couple days of getting spoiled by mum and dad in the shadow of another recent addition to the Norths list of obscure tourist attractions. The Brompton of the North:</p>
<p><a title="P1010774 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15745562138"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7471/15745562138_6539b3b57b_o.jpg" alt="P1010774" width="1200" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>Ooh, of course I mean the <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_of_the_North" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_of_the_North" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angel of the North by Antony Gormley</a></p>
<p><strong>Cycling England coast to coast</strong></p>
<p>At the time of booking the ferry it seemed like a great idea. I&#8217;d always wanted to cycle the coast to coast route in Northern England. After cycling <a title="Cycling USA Coast 2 Coast" href="http://www.shanecycles.com/cycling-usa-coast-2-coast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">c2c in the USA</a> and almost a double c2c in <a title="http://shanecycles.com/africa" href="http://shanecycles.com/africa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Southern Africa </a> how hard could it be?</p>
<p>Sadly I only had 5-6 days to cycle the 270km and had no idea what my chances where of completing that on a Brompton with baggage, and I wasn&#8217;t so keen to cycle the last leg of the busy road to Whitehaven. So I just set off with the plan to see how far I could get then just catch a bus or train back to Newcastle (the BIG advantage of a Brompton).</p>
<p>I picked the Hadrians wall trail up again at the Swing bridge and followed the overly signed route that had me crossing a main road several times along glass covered paths until a local cyclists showed me the preferred route out of Newcastle along the river Tyne. Once outside the city the route became a nice quiet cycle route along the river or on old railway lines. The Autumn colours in full swing.</p>
<p><a title="P1010776 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15745707260"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7461/15745707260_77bfae127d_o.jpg" alt="P1010776" width="1200" height="674" /></a></p>

<p>I took a leisurely lunch in the historic town of Corbridge then followed the published cycle route again as far as Hexham. Once in Hexham I left the route and headed via B roads parallel with the North Tyne river to pick up the Reivers route near Bellingham. During this leg I got my first taste of the Pennines, you won&#8217;t be surprised to know its fairly impossible to cycle up a 17% hill with a 2 spd Brompton with trailer :).</p>
<p><a title="IMG_0674 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15932996365"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7529/15932996365_bfdef08b00_b.jpg" alt="IMG_0674" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_0672 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15932349812"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7533/15932349812_7bbdd8d735_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0672" width="1200" height="900" /></a></p>
<p>At the unlikely village of Wark I found a nice little tea room that had great coffee (something that is finally possible to find in the UK in many places). Here I filled my belly and waterbag before pedalling for another hour or two until my wild camping spot just before Kielder.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_0680 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15745567268"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7480/15745567268_b4c8f0202a_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0680" width="1200" height="900" /></a></p>
<p>Though I&#8217;d planned to wild camp the whole trip the first night showed how miserable this really is in November. It had rained in recent days and all evening, so everything was just wet and boggy. Its great to cycle in winter as you can hibernate 12-14 hours a night in the dark but if everything is wet and miserable its not ideal to be honest. Luckily my years of experience, the luxury of great food and fancy gear meant I stayed warm, dry and happy unlike the night I wild camped at the same spot 26 years earlier (and phoned dad the next morning to come and rescue me, which of course involved a 10km walk to the nearest phone in the pre mobile era).</p>
<p>With 83km in the pocket, and a taste of the Pennines in my legs I slept like the fat lazy out of practice tour cyclist I&#8217;ve become. Waking to the worm/bug/moth thing crawling on my neck long before sunrise (I&#8217;d left my inner tent at home to save weight).</p>
<p>The great thing about cycling in the UK is that it doesn&#8217;t matter if it is April, August or November the chance of it being rainy, miserable and cold are 90%. Meaning the best time to visit is 1st feb to 31st Jan.</p>
<p>Day 2 started wet and windy, and didn&#8217;t change until 90km later just outside Carlisle. But on the second day of finally being on the road again nothing could dampen my spirits. I was so full of joy to be riding again, my belly was full, my legs strong and the wind gods had chosen for the first time in years to bless me. I stopped briefly at Kielder reservoir just after dawn to reflect on a school geography project from when I was 14-15 years old. TV documentary images of families being kicked of their farms to feed industries water demands of 1970&#8217;s NE England and the layout of the valley still fresh in my mind all these years later despite it being before my time. I could visualise the construction process of the main tower from text books, and of course one of my first nights of cold wild camping only 300m behind that main tower in woods in 1988 with my little brother.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_0683 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15745567018"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8624/15745567018_31277c9718_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0683" width="1200" height="900" /></a></p>
<p>I followed the main road around Kielder rather than the Reivers or any of the mountain bike routes for obvious reasons, luckily there are few tourists or local traffic on the road in early November. The wind did its magic and I quickly passed Kielder village, briefly crossed the Scottish border then settled down for an awesome Scottish Breakfast in Newcastleton.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_0685 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15907204266"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8575/15907204266_ac371dd9dd_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0685" width="1200" height="900" /></a></p>

<p>I missed the sign to get me onto the Reivers route after Newcastlton so just followed B roads to Carlisle (incl a rather nasty 5km on the A7&#8230;.don&#8217;t do that, life is too short).</p>
<p><a title="IMG_0689 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15313365553"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7528/15313365553_fc23c5c759_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0689" width="1200" height="900" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_0692 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15747248027"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7469/15747248027_01df73047b_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0692" width="1200" height="900" /></a></p>
<p>Rather damp and tired but damn happy after my 90km+ I decided just to check into a cheap B+B I know in Carlisle.</p>
<p>Day 3 I was already running 2 days ahead of schedule and still feeling strong, 55km of the Reivers route and 1 puncture and only a couple of nasty climbs later I was in Keswick in the Lake District.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_0709 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15747247317"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7497/15747247317_f80a0c9021_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0709" width="1200" height="900" /></a></p>

<p><a title="Brompton touring set up by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15868160155"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7534/15868160155_a51b5d5cd6_b.jpg" alt="Brompton touring set up" width="1024" height="459" /></a></p>
<p>The last couple of km&#8217;s into Keswick had been really bad with traffic, I really don&#8217;t envy British cyclists, they really are die hards. I decided against cycling the last leg to the coast, while would I want to? I was ahead of time and didn&#8217;t have a death wish, though my legs were dead. After 3 awesome days of super cycling I decided it best to take a day off in Keswick then try to cycle back towards Newcastle, I had 1 day + a reserve day to get back, a tall order but a wonderful challenge :), and if I didn&#8217;t make it I could always catch a bus.</p>
<p>Day 5 I left Keswick via the old railway line, now converted into a cycle path, followed by several back roads until Penrith.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_0740 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15313363913"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7550/15313363913_4e77196c8f_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0740" width="1200" height="900" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_0730 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15932994735"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7472/15932994735_78ab8606e0_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0730" width="1200" height="900" /></a></p>
<p>Somewhere after Penrith I lost the C2C route and missed out cycling Hartside pass, not the end of the world I guess, the rest of the day was a series of small climbs through country lanes and villages towards the Yorkshire dales, finally ending at the lovely converted church now Youth Hostel in <a title="http://www.kirkbystephenhostel.co.uk" href="http://www.kirkbystephenhostel.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kirkby Stephen</a>(now an independent hostel run the way I remember hostels being run, by the lovely Denise Robinson rather than YHA). A hot shower and pot of tea fixed me up nicely after another hilly, wet and cold 90km day, followed by a great local pub dinner.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_0737 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15931038551"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7462/15931038551_775b42a947_o.jpg" alt="IMG_0737" width="1200" height="1600" /></a></p>

<p>So with only a quick ride over the Pennines and 110km back to my parents house I figured day 6 should be do-able.</p>

<p>The 1-2 climbs over the pennines that I expected to Consett turned out to be about 6 x2-300m climbs, some 15% or more. Totally not suited to a 2 spd Brompton. Stubbornness and 2nd breakfast brought me to Consett just before dark, broken and tired I was once again on home turf. The converted trail track from Consett to Birtley had been a popular cycle route for me 20 years earlier. It was all down hill from here and 30km on character should always be possible. Three hours later I was broken but home.</p>
<p><em>It wasn&#8217;t quite coast to coast, it wasn&#8217;t quite a trip down memory lane, it wasn&#8217;t quite a big trip. But, it was and amazing little and challenging escape through a beautiful part of the world. I wish I&#8217;d had more time to explore the country I once called home!!</em></p>
