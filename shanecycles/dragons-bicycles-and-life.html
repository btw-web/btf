<h1>Dragons, bicycles and life</h1>
<p>When I recently mentioned on a forum that I&#8217;d &#8220;rescued&#8221; the frame for my new bike someone wrote:</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8221; I think most of us are still reeling from the fact such a thing of beauty could in any way be rescued&#8230;</em></strong><br />
<strong> <em>it&#8217;s like the start of a fairy story, we want to know more, were there dragons involved&#8230;&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>So here it is, the story about the rescue of Red and some adventures with dragons.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a galant not so young but awfully handsome knight with a black steed called Mr Hyde. They&#8217;d had many awesome adventures together in far off lands, fighting off evil corrupt customs agents, touts and slaying various horrible stomach bugs. Occasionally rescuing beautiful maidens (and sometimes not so beautiful maidens).</p>

<p>But this couldn&#8217;t go on forever. The evil gold dragon started to complain that the gold was almost gone, so the awfully handsome knight once again had to exchange his spurs for spanners and go back to work. After a summer of spannering the brave knight was once again ready for adventure and the gold dragon allowed him to have a short escape, the only condition was that the brave knight couldn&#8217;t go searching out adventure and maidens in Africa where he might have fun but had to suffer somewhere, a penance for only working 7 months in 2 years.</p>
<p>Happy to get the opportunity to hit the road again, the knight and his trusty steed took up the challenge to become the first 2 wheeled team to attempt to cycle the Trans Labrador highway in winter.</p>

<p><a title="Trans lab (13) by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/11668765264"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3737/11668765264_8b8d65c2f9_b.jpg" alt="Trans lab (13)" width="1024" height="614" /></a></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly they were thwarted by the evil Ice dragon and had to take a couple of lifts despite their best intentions and heroism in the Ice dragons domein.</p>
<p><a title="Trans lab (18) by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/11668387445"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2894/11668387445_941f249f55_b.jpg" alt="Trans lab (18)" width="1024" height="614" /></a></p>
<p>Anyway, on their return the Gold dragon was very angry and insisted that the awfully handsome knight get his arse back to work and make some gold again if he ever wanted to have a life other than renting a room while he worked each summer and living in a tent each winter. So, the rather smart knight thought he&#8217;d be better off working freelance. This would give him more flexibility and a slight illusions of still making his own choices. During the free lance process the brave knight had an epic battle with the evil Insurance dragon that had no intentions of giving medical and disability insurance to someone brave enough to camp and travel in the Ice dragons lands at -40. On his way back from the insurance dragons lair, bruised and bleeding from the 2 month battle the brave knight started having doubts about his choice to live such a brave and heroic life (and the choice to share his life on the internet giving the Insurance dragon free ammunition), and renting a 3&#215;2.6m room no longer seemed right for someone so heroic and handsome, maybe there was a maiden out there that wanted more?</p>
<p><a title="The Shane cave by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/8627878599"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8266/8627878599_f65de2fb59_b.jpg" alt="The Shane cave" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>So the choice was made to track down the evil Mortgage dragon and try to make a deal, the deal was possible but then the handsome knight would have to work more than 7 months a year and sell his soul to the dragon and take part in a very prestigious race. The awfully handsome knight couldn&#8217;t understand what was so prestigious about a race involving rats?</p>
<p>So, no more trips of 3-12 months, time to start thinking of interesting adventurers that are shorter, more interesting and preferably closer to home. Things like the <a title="http://www.transandalus.org" href="http://www.transandalus.org" target="_blank">Trans Andalusia</a>, <a title="http://highlandtrail.net" href="http://highlandtrail.net" target="_blank">Highland 550</a> and later the <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Trail_(South_Africa)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Trail_(South_Africa)" target="_blank">Freedom Trail</a> and revisiting the more rugged paths of previous adventures.</p>
<p><a title="2012-11-14 14.10.04 by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/8246001621"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8066/8246001621_65cc063bd1_b.jpg" alt="2012-11-14 14.10.04" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>
<p>Though Mr Hyde was a thoroughbred and not ready to retire, he was a cross between a warhorse and workhorse and just wasn&#8217;t quite nimble enough for the interesting adventures the awfully handsome knight was dreaming up for his winter escapes from the race with the rats. So, Mr Hyde received an early dismissal package of lighter wheels, shiny mudguards and only one gear to keep his life simple in his golden years.</p>
<p><a title="Spring sunrise by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/13503828025"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7373/13503828025_5642dec083_b.jpg" alt="Spring sunrise" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>
<p>It was time to look for a new young and agile though well build steed for the next round of adventure, it seemed so simple, a second hand 26&#8243; MTB should be cheap and easy to find during the current gold rush for 27,5 and 29&#8243;. Sadly the brave knight had high standards and wishes after 25,000km of adventure on Mr Hyde and other steeds. He just couldn&#8217;t fall in love with aluminium frames. But, he had a cunning plan, with cap in hand he went to the <a title="http://www.m-gineering.nl" href="http://www.m-gineering.nl" target="_blank">great craftsman</a> who had once build Mr Hyde for him and asked if maybe one of the 200 brave steeds hanging around his farm could be rescued before dying of old age. Just maybe the great craftsman could find it in his heart to sell one of his younger, full of life great creations.</p>

<p>&#8221; Built for a bike show in 2010, and ridden for a weekend or two, yours for&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by Shane Cycles, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shanecycles/15217309738"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2945/15217309738_3fe9fe3141_b.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>
<p>It was slightly too big, top tube longer than Mr Hyde but the oversized red Reynolds 853 tubes were so pretty, it had wonderful details and craftsmanship, huge tire clearance and a farm gate sized frame meant lots of real estate for frame bags.</p>
<p>&#8221; I can make that fit, sold to the man with the big ears&#8221; .</p>
<p>Lots of new bits, some bits robbed off Mr Hyde, other bits that where lying around in the knights new castle. There was some room for improvements later but Frankenstein was born and ready for action.</p>
<p>And the rest as they say is history, waiting to be written. . . . .</p>
