<p>It has been a little more than two weeks since Oakley and I returned from our bike journey across the United States. We are gradually re-assimilating into our community, our responsibilities and our routines. But we are not the same. Our bicycle adventure feels like it has changed the lenses through which we see. No joke.</p>



<p>Speaking for myself, I feel 10 years younger. I have energy and enthusiasm that I have not felt since I was 30. I feel as though, if you could peak beneath my skin, instead of blood and guts you would find the fields of Kansas with golden oats blowing in the wind under a clear blue sky. You would find the clear rivers tumulting down from the Cascade Mountains in Oregon. You would find the sound of coyotes yipping and yodeling under the Wyoming night sky. You would find a stranger, offering me shelter, a cup of coffee and a donut in Kentucky and warming up my heart, belly and giving me courage.</p>



<p>As for Oakley, he too is changed. He told me this weekend that he felt that people were treating him like a he was an adult lately, and it made him want to act like one. A neighbor stopped my husband and me on a walk this morning and commented that the biggest change she sees in Oakley, aside from his stature, confidence and strength, is that he doesn&#8217;t seem twitchy anymore. He is contained and relaxed and moves with ease and composure. It is true. There is an inner calm in him.</p>



<p>A few times since our return, Oakley has needed a reminder that his behavior was becoming too intense. I have separated him from others at these points and was able to have calm conversations with him. &#8220;Is this how you want to be?&#8221; Or: &#8220;Remember on our trip, how we did it differently?&#8221; And he does remember. And he does regroup without becoming deregulated. He wants this. He knows how good it feels to be in control and be granted adult status.</p>



<p>The other day Oakley and I went for a walk to check in with each other. We talked all about the trip. We talked about how being home is sometimes overstimulating. I told him I would do it again next summer if I could, and he said he would do it again when he was 30. I guess I didn&#8217;t scar him for life after all.</p>



<p>I wish everybody could have a reboot such as ours every once in a while.  Now I face trying to recreate a career and find ways to dig us out of the financial pit that our bike trip created.  Yesterday my husband and I sat down at the kitchen table and analyzed the train wreck of our finances. But I don&#8217;t feel overwhelmed. I feel like there are endless possibilities, and if I just stay open to them it will work all out. </p>



<p>This Thursday, Oakley and I are giving a slide show about our trip at the local community center. I absolutely detest public speaking, but it seems important to share our tale with everybody who supported us. I will be uncomfortable and a jittery mess, but if I can bike across the country, I can do this. I can do a lot that I never thought I could.</p>
