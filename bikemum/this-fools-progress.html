<p>&#8220;Oh my God, I can&#8217;t get this freaking pedal back on! Oaks come here, I need your help!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am busy!&#8221; shouts Oakley, from the nearby trampoline where he has just completed his 65th backflip. &#8220;Watch me!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No Oaks, come now. Please!&#8221; Oakley hops down gruffly and stomps over. &#8220;Here, try to get this pedal back on. I keep trying, and I can&#8217;t screw it in.&#8221;  I need to attach &#8220;Power Grip&#8221; toe clips to my pedals so I can push down and pull up with them for added leverage as I climb hills and mountains and my bike’s original pedals won&#8217;t accommodate them. I just need to swap them out with another recycled pair. How can it be this hard?</p>



<p>Oakley lightly pushes me out of the way. &#8220;Move over.&#8221; He is annoyed that I have interrupted his jumping, and he is more than a little sick of bicycles, but also a little proud that I needed his help with something mechanical. He tries once&#8211;no go&#8211;he tries again&#8211; &#8220;It&#8217;s stripped!&#8221; he pronounces, and drops the offending pedal on the deck. In seconds, he has bounced back to the trampoline and has executed backflip number 66. I am in this alone.</p>



<p>It can&#8217;t be stripped&#8211;it looks perfectly good! I kneel down on the deck and try again and again. I try with slightly different angles. With increased pressure, with a light touch. Nothing. I can&#8217;t gain any purchase.</p>



<p>Jesus Christ. I wobble off my knees that have begun to ache from being mashed against the wooden planks of the deck and fall to my bum. This is ridiculous. I can&#8217;t even put a pedal on. How am I ever going to get across the country? I think of all the people who have commented online about how I am getting in over my head. Those people don&#8217;t even know how mechanically uninclined I am!</p>



<p>I admit it. I am all thumbs, and, as I have previously mentioned, not at all detail-oriented. Even trying to tighten the brakes of my bicycle often gives me busted knuckles. I am clumsy, and, honestly, don&#8217;t know my left from my right, am one-eyed with no depth perception, and have a tendency to rush in a most unhelpful way. This is going to be tough, but I won&#8217;t give up, no matter what!</p>



<p>I crawl back up to my knees and try again two more, three more times&#8230;.. then I give up. </p>



<p>&#8220;Oaks!&#8221; I call, &#8220;I am walking to the bike shop.&#8221; With my head hung low I coast down the hill to Brad&#8217;s Bikes. When I <g class="gr_ gr_1593 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace" id="1593" data-gr-id="1593">arrive</g>, Brad is in the front yard tuning up one of his rentals. </p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; he says with a wry grin, noticing my obvious discomfort as I stand there, bike in one hand, pedal in the other.</p>



<p>&#8220;Brad, I am so embarrassed. This is humiliating. I can&#8217;t even put on a pedal.&#8221;  Brad knows all about this upcoming bike trip. He has been nothing but supportive. I hand him the pedal. He takes it and shakes his head. </p>



<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t humiliating. This is learning.&#8221; He explains that one bike pedal is threaded clockwise and the other threaded counterclockwise, so I had been trying to screw one of them in backward the whole time. This is so the pedal won&#8217;t unwind itself. He laughs, but kindly as always. In no time at all, we attach the pedal, and I ride back home. Problem solved. <br></p>



<p>I do worry about my shortcomings on this trip. I do acknowledge that I am a bit half-cocked. I am sure that about Oaks will send me straight to crazy town, but, I will carry Brad&#8217;s words with me. </p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t humiliating; it&#8217;s learning. Fenders come next.<br> </p>
