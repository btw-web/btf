Cave-in-Rock, Illinois</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are caves along the side of the Ohio river near Rosiclaire, Illinois that penetrate the sandstone bluffs for over 100 yards. They have wide mouths and tapering long tunnels that open up into ball room-sized cathedrals with vaulted ceilings and wide flat floors. Bank robbers and pirates used to hide out in them, I am sure. We could picture them with stashes of gold and banknotes, counting and calculating their next heists, peering out through the dark, cool hideouts to the bright, swiftly moving current of the Ohio River, waiting for the next ship, or barge to slip unsuspectingly into view. I often have a way of making everything seem more romantic especially the past. </p>



<p>Oakley and I spent an afternoon in the caves before passing into Kentucky. We didn&#8217;t find any hidden treasure except for the caves themselves, but none-the-less felt wealthier from the experience. It has been eleven months since our bicycle ride across the United States and every day I work to keep our experiences alive. </p>



<p>I have just finished writing a book called <em>Cycle Back. </em>It is about our cycling adventure as well as what it has been like to navigate life with a wild, impulsive, joyful son that has not always been able to fit in with mainstream society. He has taken me on a journey far further than just our three-month bike ride. One that I would never trade a minute of, despite the challenges and obstacles. I have spent my life chasing him and I will continue to do so, not only because I love him, but because the run continues to keep us both alive and awake with our eyes wide open. We are both extremely lucky.</p>



<p>Now we have been isolating on our island home for nearly 100 days. Our adventure has had to change shape and instead of traveling the world, we travel our yard, the beaches, and the coastal rocks, but now, it is becoming too much. Without enough stimulation, I become dull and Oakley begins to create stimulation in less than desirable ways. He is up to many of his old tricks. So, we will strike out again. </p>



<p>In two weeks we will bike from Portland, Maine to Ticonderoga, New York. We will cross the White Mountains and the Green Mountains, sally through New Hampshire and Vermont, and just see what happens. This time Oakley is excited. He knows when it is time to go. We will be collecting new stories and using this trip as a reboot. </p>



<p>I remember when we made it over The Ochoco Pass in Oregon when it was 104 degrees and we wore sweat like a blanket. God, Oaks was so mad at me when I wouldn&#8217;t stop for lunch until we made it to the top. Nothing could have been harder. But then we came down the other side into the basin-like desert where the stratifications in the rocks striped the land with ochre, mustard yellow, rust, and dusky blue. We sped down and down the serpentine mountain highway, the wind drying our sweat, cooling us, and making us grin with triumph.</p>



<p>Oakley does too. &#8220;That was crazy. It was like two different worlds.&#8221;</p>



<p>I remember when we ate nothing but peanut butter taco&#8217;s, Pringles and salad in a bag for a week and Oakley was wasting away, his eyes wan and cheeks gaunt. We were so hungry! And then we got to Breckenridge, Colorado, after an 80 mile ascent and found an upscale Thai restaurant. We waltzed in there, despite our grimy, stained, neon-yellow bike shirts and padded britches and ordered two Drunken Noodle meals. We ate them in rabid silence. They were the best Drunken Noodles ever, anywhere.</p>



<p>Oakley agrees, &#8220;They were so good, and the people were so nice. I think they gave us extra.&#8221;</p>



<p>And now this is hard too. But we will get through it. We both know it. </p>

We watched the brown water churn beneath us as we smoothly sailed to Kentucky. On the other side, we saw an Amish boy run down a path and literally skip across a footbridge that crossed a small stream. He wore a crisp sky-blue shirt, black trousers with suspenders, and a straw hat. He was barefoot and grinning. I wish he could have been Oakley&#8217;s friend.</figcaption></figure>
