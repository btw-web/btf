<p>We have made the halfway mark of our adventure. We have ridden 2,100 miles (half of our total 4,200) in six weeks (half our intended 12). We have crossed the highest point in the Rockies (Hoosier Pass at 11,539 feet) and have now descended onto the flats of Colorado and western Kansas. We also did some math yesterday and figured out that we have climbed over 43,000 feet in elevation. </p>



<p>The truth is, I am amazed at our progress. This is hard. Our bodies are becoming machines, and food has truly become fuel, with no fuss. You should see the things we eat! Convenience-store living at its best&#8211;nothing highbrow about it. If it is going to fill the void within us and give our muscles and attitudes something to work with, it is going in. </p>



<p>We bike until we are exhausted and feel that there is no way we can continue beyond the next bend, and then we turn around it and meet a headwind that will stay against us for the next 10 miles, and you know what? We do it. Of <g class="gr_ gr_19 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="19" data-gr-id="19">course</g> we do. And then we sleep. Just about anywhere. City parks, campgrounds under streetlights, with trains rushing past. We pay no <g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="20" data-gr-id="20">mind,</g> because sleep is like fuel, and we just take it. We have both found that we have more inside us than we see thought.</p>



<p>The challenges have only been partly physical. We have dealt with many mechanical issues and find ourselves working on some busted part of our bicycles nearly daily. This has made us come eye to eye with how we handle frustration. Oakley and I have had many conversations that begin, “Is this attitude helpful?” There is a lot of learning going on and truthfully, Oakley has become much more in control of his emotions then he ever has ever been before.</p>



<p>There have also been lessons concerning anxiety and living in the moment. If we look at the entirety of this trip, let alone what we may face in the next two days, it can seem pretty overwhelming. Chasing dogs, headwinds, tall passes, lack of services, busy highways, rain, and on and on. It can make us forget the joy of the pass we are whooshing down or the beauty of the evening sky as we sit by our tent. We have both learned that now is not worth sabotaging for the fear of later. Oakley helps me with this, and he often chastises me when I worry about what is to come.</p>



<p>After crossing Hoosier Pass and feeling mighty high in our socks, we were caught off guard by the beauty of the mountains &#8212; our confidence and our exhaustion &#8212; and we had our first near miss. I will not go into it, because I am sure Oakley will in his blog post. This trip is not foolproof, and it is dangerous. We were both very scared. </p>



<p>When we recovered, we continued biking against a head wind for quite a while, still shaken and emotionally wrought. When we finally arrived at our designated campsite for the evening, a state park in Pueblo, Colorado, we were turned away. The next site was 10 miles away. It was the lowest we have felt. </p>

<p>I called my husband Twain to seek adult counsel, and he was fairly horrified about what our day had entailed. He said,  “You can come home, you know<g class="gr_ gr_67 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace" id="67" data-gr-id="67">&#8230;.</g> You don’t have to do this&#8230; You guys have done enough&#8230;.”  I was shocked. Quitting hadn’t occurred to me. Later, I mentioned it to Oakley.</p>



<p>“Papa mentioned that we could quit if we wanted.” Oakley’s forehead wrinkled and he looked at me like I was out of my mind. </p>



<p>“We aren’t doing that!” he responded. “Papa’s crazy.” </p>



<p>So on that note, I would have to say that this trip is perfect. Sometimes it feels magical, and sometimes it feels grueling. We are both aware that we would never see the beautiful places we have seen; the tiny mountain towns; the clear tumbling streams; the bison and elk roaming the wilds; and the kind people, if we didn’t cart ourselves up these passes on our bikes. Equally important is the understanding that Oakley and I have that and we wouldn&#8217;t be learning these lessons if it was easy. We are so lucky.</p>

<p>Oakley’s Perspective: Highs and Lows</p>



<p>Ok, so my mom probably has told you guys about this, but on Friday the 13th I believe I almost died. We were biking down a fairly busy road when an overly loaded truck came up behind us. My mom saw the big truck and called to me, &#8220;Stopping!&#8221; so we could get out of the way, but she was not loud enough for me to hear. I had turned my head to look at what was hulking behind me. When I turned my head back around I crashed into my mom&#8217;s slowing bike and tumbled right in front of that giant over-loaded truck. THAT, <g class="gr_ gr_19 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="19" data-gr-id="19">my</g> <g class="gr_ gr_18 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="18" data-gr-id="18">friend,</g> was the scariest moment in my LIFE.</p>



<p> Anyway, now for the high. My high is getting out of the Rockies. We did our last huge pass a <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="4" data-gr-id="4">couple</g> days ago right outside Breckenridge, Colorado, the pass was really hard, but it was worth it.</p>



<p>We are halfway done with this trip. In no time we will be across Kansas, and then into Missouri and Kentucky, which I&#8217;m not excited about at all. Kentucky dogs, here I come. I feel really happy that we have gotten this far, and I know that there is no turning back now that we have made such good progress.</p>
