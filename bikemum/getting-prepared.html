<p>&#8220;Alison, Run!!!!&#8221;</p>



<p>My friend Alison is hiking along the <a href="https://www.outdoors.org/get-involved/join?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_4Slz8fF4AIVw1cNCh3CpgepEAAYASAAEgLW-PD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Appalachian Trail (opens in a new tab)">Appalachian Trail</a> about 50 feet ahead of me. We have been hiking alone for 10 days and are carrying 50-pound backpacks, so her running is more like a hurried hobble.</p>



<p>I see her try to pick up her pace, stumbling over roots and rocks as she continues to ascend the ridge, but her speed doesn&#8217;t accelerate much. &#8220;Go!&#8221; I call frantically. She can&#8217;t look over her shoulder because we are wearing poorly-packed, external-frame packs that extend high over our heads with sleeping pads and pots and pans strapped to the outside.  Alison has no idea why I am suddenly commanding her to hurry, but due to the timbre of my voice she doesn&#8217;t stop to question me.</p>



<p>Behind me, I hear the thudding of heavy feet galloping up the trail. Something big is coming fast. I hear the leaves and brush rustle and scrape, but I don&#8217;t dare to turn around. The faster I run, the faster it pursues me. I am in a blind panic. &#8220;Alison!&#8221;</p>



<p>We are both 16 years old. This trip had been my idea. The previous summer I had attended <a href="https://farmandwilderness.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Camp Farm &amp; Wilderness (opens in a new tab)">Camp Farm &amp; Wilderness</a>, and now felt that I was well versed in outdoor living. I had convinced Alison that we should hike on the Appalachian Trail for a month and survive off of wild edibles along the way. I had also just read &#8220;My Side of the Mountain&#8221; and pictured us fishing out of clear streams with hooks carved from saplings and eating pine nuts and acorn pancakes to sustain ourselves. Surprisingly, our parents thought this would be a good experience. Maybe they were in need of some respite.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, it was harder than it sounds. By the second day, we were starving and begging other through-hikers for handfuls of trail mix. We hadn&#8217;t even brought a stove and realized quickly that acorns, while <g class="gr_ gr_59 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="59" data-gr-id="59">theoretically</g> a food, are as bitter as hell if you don&#8217;t cook them for hours. </p>



<p>Needless to say, we were ill-prepared. No stove, no food, no maps. And now we were in bear country. We had recently passed a sign that gave instructions for a bear encounter:</p>



<ul><li>Do not run</li><li>Back up slowly</li><li>Climb tree</li><li>Use pepper spray</li></ul>



<p>At night I had been sleeping with a butcher knife under my pillow&#8211;just in case. But currently, that knife was buried deep in my backpack. I was helpless against my attacker. In my rush, I tripped. My heavily-laden backpack toppled me forward, and I hit the ground hard. My knees crashed down on a rock, and I struggled to quickly unclasp my hip belt and twist free of the weight of my pack. I was picturing the bear shredding me with his long teeth and jagged claws, and I wanted to be ready to kick at him. With a sharp intake of breath, I turned to face my doom.</p>



<p>There was nothing. Instead, I saw my sleeping bag had become unrolled and had been dragging on the ground behind me, bumping along the rocks and roots and sounding very much like a bear in hot pursuit. The relief that flooded me could be sold as a street drug.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alison,&#8221; I called. &#8220;It was my sleeping bag.&#8221; She dropped her pack immediately and looped back down the trail to me. She was covered with sweat, her cheeks shone red, and her breathing was ragged. She laughed, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get some pictures of your bloody knees.&#8221; (See picture above.) I posed, and she took some shots.&#8221;We should probably sing to keep the bears away&nbsp;from now on.&#8221; she said. I agreed. So, we did.</p>



<p>I saw Alison yesterday for the first time in 18 years. We met in a coffee shop called Book and Bar in Portsmouth New Hampshire. She was with her 11-year-old daughter. Alison had read this blog and reached out across cyberspace to reconnect. As we spoke her daughter leaned over and whispered in her mom&#8217;s ear. &#8220;Is this the one?&#8221;</p>



<p> &#8220;<g class="gr_ gr_16 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace" id="16" data-gr-id="16">What ?</g> &#8221; I asked. </p>



<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Alison laughed, &#8220;She has heard stories.&#8221; We started swapping tales of that trip. How we hiked with ferns behind our ears to keep the gnats away and ended up looking like forest nymphs. How we hadn&#8217;t even brought a stove or a map. How in our starvation we took a break from the trail and hitchhiked to Arby&#8217;s. We set up our tent up in the parking lot and ate dinner and breakfast there. We remembered asking a farmer to sleep in his barn along the hike during a terrible thunderstorm and huddling under his tractor to avoid his very agitated horse that was also seeking shelter. It was rearing up and kicking at the hard-packed dirt all around our heads. We spent the night questioning whether we had ever heard of a horse trampling someone to death. We remembered how kind everybody was and how helpful. &#8220;You will have a lot of adventures, Penny, just <g class="gr_ gr_24 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation multiReplace" id="24" data-gr-id="24">wait.</g>&#8221; Alison said.</p>



<p>We paid no attention to detail, we relied on the goodness of strangers, and we learned more than we could have ever from a book or a screen. It was terribly uncomfortable, and, at times, we were alternately exhausted, starving, and terrified or all three at once, but, of course, it was worth it. </p>



<p>On this bike adventure I will bring food, lots of it, and maps too, and I hope the appropriate gear. I still welcome the craziness of not planning every moment, but, given my track record of chaos, I will try a little harder to give some thought ahead of time to some of the details.</p>



<p> I hope Oakley will sing with me if I get scared of bears like Alison did.</p>



<p>Here is what we are planning to bring:</p>
