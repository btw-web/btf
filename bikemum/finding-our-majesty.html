<p>Nothing feels right. Oakley and I have loaded up our bikes and are heading off to Pineland Farms for some mountain biking. It should be fun, but rather than the heady feeling of adventure in the air there is a staleness, acridity. I don’t feel much like chatting. I am weary. Oakley thinks this is because I am annoyed with some of his recent antics, but it is not. It is because of all the ugly vitriol flooding the airwaves today. </p>



<p>Before I am any political affiliation or any nationality, I am a human, and it feels as if human decency is what we are losing, no matter who wins. I believe in empathy first and foremost. Empathy for everyone and everything, regardless of political affiliation. It is the only way to come together. Today, everything feels like it is coming apart. </p>



<p>When Oakley and I rode across the United States, I was struck by the lost towns in the high deserts of Wyoming and the hollows of Kentucky. There were trailers with broken windows held together with duct tape and yards full of plastic garbage. Yes, there was the stereotypical abundance of dogs, many seeming less than robust, but if you can&#8217;t fix your window so your house can stay warm, how can you afford a vet bill?</p>



<p> In Eastern Colorado and Kansas, it felt like there were more prisoners than local people and on the open plains, mono-crops were king. There were no sweet, small organic gardens, just acre upon acre of genetically modified milo-a kind of silage for cattle. Every so often we would come upon small towns that seemed to have been hubs of activity once, but now are windswept and deserted. Forgotten. </p>



<p>Despite all these thoughts, today, I try to focus on the adventure at hand, but when Oakley and I arrive at our destination, we are told that we can not ride. It happens to be Veterans&#8217; Hunting Day at Pineland Farms and it wouldn’t be safe.  In fact, we are reminded that really we shouldn’t mountain bike anywhere today because of hunting season. Nowhere is safe.</p>



<p>We shuffle back to the truck and I rack my brain for a new idea, but I haven’t got much energy. We settle on the Gray Animal Park-it is a zoo-like establishment for local animals that cannot be re-released into the wild due to accident and injury. We watch the cougars sit listlessly upon cut tree trunks in their display. Oakley is chased by a flock of flightless Canadian geese, hissing through their wide, pink, open mouths. We watch a coyote pace relentlessly in his enclosure. All these animals had the potential to be majestic if they had been given the right environment. If they had not been injured or abused. If scarcity had not been an issue. If they had been well cared for. </p>



<p>I think people have the ability to be majestic too. I have been criticized for being overly idealistic and naive. It is true, I am. I don&#8217;t mean to go on a political rant on Adventure Wednesday, but Adventure Wednesdays are all about hope to me; hope that we can find beauty,  accept challenge, and discover our strength. On a day like today, I feel like I have to dig a little bit deeper to find it inside. I will though, and for that, I am lucky and privileged.</p>
