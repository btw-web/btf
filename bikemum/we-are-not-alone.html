<p>&#8220;Where are you going to high school?&#8221; asks a well-intentioned parent at Oakley&#8217;s graduation from middle school. </p>



<p>&#8220;Well, eventually to Casco Bay High School<g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace" id="3" data-gr-id="3">,</g> but first I am going to bike across the country.&#8221; </p>



<p>Really? When? Where will you travel? Are you camping? How far will you travel every day? Have you started training? That is so cool. Amazing.</p>



<p>Oakley answers to the best of his ability, and as he does I see the pride and confidence about this crazy adventure growing within him. He obviously feels somewhat of a celebrity. These people, these curious well-wishers are like fuel, and they will be an important part of what carries him up the mountains and all the way home. </p>



<p>I have decidedly become a narcissistic, loud mouth about our bike adventure, but I can&#8217;t overstate the importance of all the support and encouragement we are receiving in return. </p>



<p>Lately, I have taken to waking up at 2:00 in the morning in somewhat of a panic, my mind racing, wondering what the hell I have gotten us into. I get up, pace the kitchen, take melatonin and creep back into bed. I snuggle a bit closer to Twain and try not to think of how many nights I will be without him and my other children&#8230;and my dog, Cricket. Instead, I attempt to quiet my mind by thinking of all those that will be with us in spirit. </p>



<p>It is pretty incredible. Over the last several months, friends and neighbors have put up with my obsessive talk about this trip and have been endlessly encouraging. I can&#8217;t believe they are still listening. They try to calm my fears and remind me of how important this trip is for me and <g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="8" data-gr-id="8">Oakley,</g> when I feel<g class="gr_ gr_573 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace gr-progress" id="573" data-gr-id="573"> </g>like forgetting.</p>



<p> My extended family, brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles, mother and cousins, who have read this blog and offered up kind words, prayers, and hopes. Some of them I have not spoken to since I was a child. Who knew they cared?</p>



<p>My closest friends from high school have reconnected with me after 30 years. They have no idea how much their friendship means. They are my life time mirror.</p>



<p>Sponsors and generous friends have stepped forward to help us financially. For some reason they believe in us. If they do, so will I.</p>



<p>Good people whom I have never met have reached out across social media and offered advice and support, easing my mind by sharing their experience and expertise with us about all manner of things from equipment to parenting advice. </p>



<p>The Sellam Circus School has been Oakley&#8217;s champion from the beginning. They have seen his potential and have challenged him to do a backflip once a day during the course of our adventure. They know that circus is an important part of his identity and by practicing his skills he will stay connected with who he is and what he can do. They understand all kids need to realize their gifts to reach their potentials and that they all have gifts.</p>



<p>The Portland Gear Hub folks have been patiently walking me through the process of gearing up. Their enthusiasm and positive attitude make this trip seem a bit less hare-brained. They don&#8217;t laugh at me when I ask what click-shifters are.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think that we could do this without any of these people. I am hopeful that we will hear their voices in our heads when faced with rainstorms, long coyote-filled nights, lonely mountain climbs and mutual tantrums. </p>



<p>I am scared. It is a lonely world out there, and the time to make this happen is nearly upon us. Every time we get encouragement from people, I am reassured that I am not going to really be alone. We will play their words like a recording on repeat over and over again. </p>



<p>This trip has become much more than a three-month adventure. It has already changed the way I see the world. The support we feel fills us with hope and excitement, and we have gained an understanding of the importance of community in our lives. I can&#8217;t thank everybody enough.</p>
