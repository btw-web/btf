<p>I awake to a deluge of rain hammering on the roof of the camping pavilion that we have set our tent up under. “Oh God,” I think to myself, “I need to put on my cheerleading hat for this one.” </p>



<p>Today is what some cross country cyclists call our last big challenge.* We need to climb Mount Vesuvius, a steep four mile ascent of 3,500 feet. Then we will follow the Blue Ridge Parkway for 35 miles and descend out of the Appalachians and towards the coast of Virginia..</p>



<p>I sneak out of the tent and rustle up some coffee before Oaks stirs, hoping it will help me put on my happy face. The rain is coming down in torrents making the metal roof hammer above me. Needless to say, I have really come to appreciate campground pavilions.</p>



<p>After two strong cups of coffee, I am ready to try my best to put a shine on the day and I wake up Oaks with a promise of hot chocolate. He takes one look around and lays back down. “You have got to be kidding me.”he mutters.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, we persevere through a gloppy breakfast of apple-spice instant oatmeal and pack up our gear. We dottle a little wishing the rain would let up a bit, but this doesn’t seem to be the case.</p>



<p>Just before we head out into the storm, a pick-up truck drives across the lawn and pulls up beside us. It is the owner of the campground. “You all are crazy,” he shouts. “Put those bicycles in my truck and I’ll drive you up that mountain. Nobody should be biking up there in this.” He climbs out of his truck and runs over to our little  shelter.  “Listen, I done took eight bikers up this hill before. It isn’t anything to be ashamed of. Come on!”</p>



<p>The rain seems to intensify as if on queue.  It would be so nice to get a ride. I am so tired and another wet ride up to a cold ridge line sounds torturous. “Thanks, but we can’t,” I say, “that would be cheating.” </p>



<p>“Come on now, it’s not cheating. Your bikes  would still be going up that mountain and look at your son.” I look at Oakley and his eyes are bright with hope. He is positively taut with it.</p>



<p>“Mom come on, it is awful out there. Please. No one will know.” I hesitate. It is so cold and wet. “Please.”he begs.</p>



<p>In that moment I waver. I am no Odysseus on a heroic quest. I am much more like Frodo, the Hobbit, a reluctant adventurer. I would like to stay dry. </p>



<p>“This man wants to help us, it would make him feel good.”whispers Oakley. A battle rages inside me. Is the campground owner the devil or an angel? I feel myself waffle.</p>



<p>Then Oakley puts on his bike helmet, and I realize he is expecting me to say no. He needs me to say no. He is leading me with no intention of doing so and has made up my mind. “Thank you so much,” I tell the man, but we have to do this.” </p>



<p>“You all are crazy.”the man mutters as we saddle up and head out into the wet, cold morning. Within minutes my sneakers have become sponges my gloves are sodden and my bangs are plastered to my head.</p>



<p>After a punishing climb, in which I questioned what the chances of  a 50-year-old woman having a heart attack were several times, Oakley and I make it to the top. We are cold and wet, but the last climb is behind us. Triumphant, we stand in unison gasping for breath. I meet his eyes and can’t help, but ask, “Do you wish we had gotten that ride?” </p>



<p>“Yes!”he answers grinning ear to ear and I grin back. I would say we both follow our roles very well.</p>



<p>Post script-Although we did make it up Vesuvius Mountain, we didn’t make it down! The rain and the fog and the cold on the Blue Ridge Parkway caused us both to become hypothermic and put us in a dangerous situation. After 20 more miles,  a bear hunter rescued us and drove us down the hill. So, we did rely on the kindness of strangers after all. I can’t thank them all enough.</p>



<p>*Thank for all your support Roderick!</p>

<p>Things that I am not going to miss from this trip:</p>



<ol><li>The headwinds in Kansas and the Rockies.</li><li>The worries about bears in Yellowstone.</li><li>The intense Rocky Mountains and Ozarks that just go up and up, over and over.</li><li>People in cars slowing down when we are riding up a big hill and telling us that it is all up hill from there.</li><li>The over-loaded trucks that seem to just about almost kill us every time they pass.</li><li>People trying to tell us we are too late in the season to try to bike across country.</li><li>Missing home.</li><li>The DOGS in Kentucky that chased us!</li><li>Roads that go straight up and don’t have switch backs.</li><li>Only talking to my mom for three months straight!</li></ol>
