<h1>Baby Bees</h1>

<p>When a baby bee is hatched, actually eats it’s way out of its cell, it crawls around getting to know it’s family. Who is who, where the food is, the the nursery, that kind of thing. When it is comfortable with the hive, it is time to fly off onto the big, exciting dangerous world. To do this, the young take what are known as “orientation flights”. <br></p>



<p>I have watched them outside the hives in my yard. The fuzzy young poking their heads out of the hive entrance and wiggling their antennas about. If all seems well, they launch themselves into the air. Their first flight is strictly vertical, about a foot up and then quickly back to the safety of the entrance. Then they do it again, two feet this time, then three, then six, then twenty. <br></p>



<p>It is not because they are being cautious about the world and taking baby steps. They are measuring. They are seeing just where their homes are in relation to everything else so that they can always find it again, no matter how far they eventually adventure seeking sweet nectar and pollen, they will know. They will never get lost. They are mapping it out. (In fact it is said that moving a hive more than two feet from it’s original base can prove too disorienting to a hive and can be its undoing).</p>



<p>I think Oakley and I are out here orientating ourselves, like the bees. We are measuring the world around us, gleefully filling up on new sights and experiences, but always checking and rechecking how to get home. I may not be a baby, but in this huge world, I feel like I am. There is just so much.<br></p>



<p>We finished our trip today. It was a long, difficult, hilly 60 miles with a fierce headwind chasing yesterday’s storm on up and out of  the Champlain valley. My thigh muscles feel twitchy and Oaks looks exhausted, but after 9 days and 450 miles, we are full and ready to go home. (I think this lake is all uphill.)</p>



<p>We have learned on our orientation flight that the world is still a beautiful place despite the fact that it can be ruthless. We have remembered what a good team we are and that we are truly lucky to have each other. We have learned that we both become stronger in many ways when we simply have to be. We have learned how much we have both grown up since last year.</p>



<p>Thank you for reading our stories. Writing helps me make sense of it all. Thank you for your comments, they make us feel supported in the most difficult of times. They make us want to be better. Oakley and I are incredibly lucky and privileged and once again I feel like Frederick the Mouse, full of beauty to last the winter through, until next year’s ride..across Utah?</p>



<p>My husband will pick is up tonight and escort us back to our hive. I miss my hive mates and long to preen everybody’s antennas to get the news. One more night by the side of this beautiful lake back on the Vermont side. One more swim. One more disgusting meal.</p>



<p>I wish everybody well. Time to go feed Oakley.<br></p>
