<p>This week my dad flew into Wichita, Kansas to bike with us for the week. While we were  biking, my mother and I were annoyed to see my dad biking very fast on his not so heavily weighted bike. He barely carried anything, and he kept acting like it was easy!  </p>



<p>A couple of days after he had joined us, we were biking along and I (of course) crashed again from hitting the back of my mother’s bike while trying to point out a big frog on the side of the road. I ended up sprawled across the ground and my bike wound up in a ditch in the bushes on the other side of the road. </p>



<p>While I collected myself, my dad offered to get my bike out the bushes and trade bikes with me for the last seven miles of the ride. He could barely pull my bike out of the ditch! He complained that it weighed as much as a tank. “Tank” is my bike’s new name. </p>



<p>Through the week of my dad visiting, he spent the whole time going really fast because he barely had any weight on his little ten speed bike. He also only liked to go 40-50 miles a day. It was an easy week.</p>



<p>Now we have reached the Ozark mountains and have quickly realized that as soon as my dad leaves my mom and I are going to hit the worst of them. He is so lucky. </p>



<p>The Ozarks are rolling hills that are absolutely straight up and down with no switch-backs again and again. They are the worst. Hopefully, we will be out of them in four days. </p>



<p>We only have about four weeks left and then we are done. I can’t believe our progress and I thank my mom for all the great adventures we have been through even though there is more coming our way.</p>

<p>This week, as we finished biking through Eastern Kansas and began our journey into the Ozark Mountains, I fell apart, physically and emotionally. I truly believe it is because I could. </p>



<p>The night before my husband, Twain joined us for a week of riding was like Christmas Eve. As I lay in my bed at the Comfort Inn in Newport, Kansas waiting for him to arrive on a 10:30 pm flight I was overwhelmed with excitement. </p>



<p>Finally, after seven weeks, I was going to have an adult partner to share all my responsibilities, decisions and parenting with. What fun we would have! How much I had missed him!  Oakley and I had rushed to get here pushing ourselves through 3 weeks of 60 mile plus day and over the Rockies and we had made it. All there was to do was lie in this cozy bed and wait. </p>



<p>So I waited. Happy and content and&#8230;chilled?</p>



<p>Finally, Twain arrived. But, as he climbed into bed and cozied up beside me, rather than feel elated, I felt something was amiss. </p>



<p>It must have come from a combination of feedlot nasties blowing in the wind, wearing sweat sodden clothes for weeks at a time and exhaustion, but as he gleefully announced that he was here I murmured, “We have one small problem.” in reply and felt my fever skyrocket.</p>



<p>This began our week together. As strong as I have been, I was that weak. Twain cooked, set up the tent, bantered with Oaks and cleaned the dishes while I sat watching the goings on like a queen.  All I was in charge of was pedaling. </p>



<p>Kansas and Missouri cooperated with my illness and all that fierce, hot, dry wind that had been plaguing us abated. The land became soft, and green filled with cows, turtles, frogs and beautiful horses. The small towns we we traveled through provided pie, Twain only wanted to do 50 miles a day. Perfect. </p>



<p>This morning as Twain  and I biked away from each at the Fall Festival in Fair Grove, Missouri, he to the airport and Oakley and I into the heart of the the Ozarks, tears were squirting out of my eyes. It is not that I don’t want to be doing this, it is that I had a taste of comfort and care and it made me wicked homesick. </p>



<p>Oakley, was trying to cheer me. “We only have less than a month left! We are going to be fine!”  Home feels like a mythical place at this point, but I am going to trust Oaks and rediscover my strength. Home will be waiting. </p>



<p>Yesterday a long, grey haired man leaned out of his old, Chevy pick up truck and called out a warning. “There are hills coming up, and some of them are going to be severe!” </p>



<p>We got this. </p>
