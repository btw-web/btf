<p>My husband Twain is driving Oakley and me up the New Jersey Turnpike towards home.  A heavy rain is rattling against the roof of the car and every few minutes we hydroplane just a little. My knees and elbows ache, and I have callouses and some gravel embedded in my palms. I have lost 20 pounds. Other than that, there is no indication that Oakley and I have just completed a 4,329-mile ride across the United States.</p>



<p>It has only been three days since we coasted to a stop in Yorktown, Virginia, but already I ache to get back on our bikes and see what is around the next corner. Watching the land unfold before us, meeting kind strangers at every stop and focusing our days on the simplest of needs, food, rest, shelter and working together, which helped life make sense. Now these billboards I see out the car window, advertising XXX Erotica at exit 8 and the Honda Car Dealership at exit 7, seem especially crass and off putting. </p>



<p>Today, I feel pulled in many directions. I am longing to see my home and family, beginning to think about what the next phase of my life is going to look like, and already missing our adventure terribly. How is this possible? </p>



<p>Oakley has been very affectionate since we finished biking, and there is a deep feeling of camaraderie between us. I feel pangs that will soon become diluted when we get caught up in our respective lives, but maybe not. Maybe our bond will settle deep within and become the substrate for dealing with future challenges and teenage transitions that we will soon be facing.</p>



<p>This trip has taught us an incredible amount about ourselves, our abilities, the world, people and how they all entwine. It has taught us that the best things come from allowing ourselves to be a bit uncomfortable, a bit scared and a bit reckless. I will never be able to thank enough everyone who has supported us along the way, both emotionally and financially. The kindness we have experienced has been astounding.</p>



<p>On the last evening of our adventure, Oakley and I camped on the side of the James River, 30 miles from the finish line at Yorktown. We made a fire and sat up talking about our highs and lows and appreciating each other’s strengths on the trip. We slept under the stars next to the dying embers. In the morning, the sun rose over the river, turning the early fog pink. “Come on mom. Get up, let’s go!” called Oaks. </p>



<p>I sat up slowly and gazed about feeling quieted by the magnitude of this day. Suddenly, we both heard a roaring clatter coming toward us. Was it a military jet? A huge power boat? We froze and peered in the direction of the sound. “What the hell?” questioned Oakley, a little on edge.</p>



<p>All at once the sky filled with birds. Thousands of grackles descended on our campsite. Truly, thousands. More than I have ever seen. The cacophony they made was so loud that we had to shout over them, which we did, sharing our disbelief at their numbers and noise. </p>



<p>The grackles ousted a couple of hawks and a handful of turkey vultures that began circling overhead. A young raccoon  went scurrying across our campsite and dove into a hole halfway up an oak tree right next to our picnic table. The grackle party went on and on. It was a madhouse. We packed up while this symphony was underway. It was like fireworks; it was like a party. It was the perfect send off, and I had tears again.</p>



<p>This trip was harder than I expected and more wonderful than I expected. I would do it again in a heart beat.</p>

<p>If there are any questions about our trip, please comment and I will be happy to respond.</p>



<p><strong>Oakley’s Perspective</strong>:</p>



<p>Our last night on the road we stayed at a campsite on a peninsula on the James River. That night in some ways was really sad and and really happy. My mother and I sat by the fire and talked about our highs and lows of the trip and what we appreciated about biking across country. We both agreed that we appreciated how people were so nice and helpful to us. People would offer to fix our bikes. Someone paid for our meal one day. Everywhere we went people were always trying to help us in some way.</p>



<p>The next morning at our lovely campsite we were eating breakfast of granola and milk and coffee when a huge swarm of grackles flew into the trees above us and all started chirping to each other. It was so loud that they started to stir up other animals such as a raccoon, some hawks and some other creatures. </p>



<p>I didn’t really accept that we were done the trip until the next morning, the day after arriving at my grandma’s house. When I woke the next morning I got up and thought to myself, “I really just biked across the country.” Even in the car right now, two days later and on the way back home to Maine, I still can’t believe it.</p>



<p>Now that am literally on my way home I think about all the adventures that I had, and I would like thank my mother for making me bike across America and go through all the hard times together. I wouldn’t have been able do this on my own.</p>



<p> Thank you, mom.</p>
