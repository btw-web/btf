<p>I had to get a TB test for a new job today out by the mall. It is about five miles from my home. The road there snakes through commercial strips, congested roadways, car dealerships, and other detritus. Not a beautiful ride, but at a balmy 35 degrees, it was unseasonably warm for February 2nd here in Maine, and I couldn&#8217;t bear getting in my car. Within a mile or two I warmed up and took off my down jacket, wool mittens and pom-pom hat (I irresponsibly had forgotten my helmet) and the cool air tickled my scalp as it blew through my hair. </p>



<p>Lately, my 16-year-old son Oakley and I have been struggling to reintegrate into life at home after our bike trip across the United States this fall. He has returned to some of his mischievous ways and I have been spending more time plotting adventures and dragging my husband up mountains than I have looking for and committing to a job. Certain people have been reminding me kindly that vacation time is over.</p>



<p>I made it to the mall far too quickly and after the TB test, turned towards home to continue working through my list of chores and HR hurdles, so that I would be ready to begin working on Monday. But, I couldn&#8217;t. </p>



<p>As I straddled my seat in the parking lot of the Quick Care Medical Center, I felt all the restlessness of being home well up inside me and I rebelliously turned the wrong way. Instead of heading back to the ferry, I just started riding, away from the cluster of shops and parking lots, traffic and litter, responsibilities and lists and towards the forests and beaches and rocky promontories found along the Maine coast. </p>



<p>The winter wind whistled in my ears, my fingers grew numb and I became hungry and thirsty. I had no water or food because I hadn&#8217;t been planning on going for a real ride, but I couldn&#8217;t stop. At every turn that could bring me back towards the city, I turned the other way. I rode for hours. I could have ridden for days. I rode until I was ready to be still, which was a very long time.</p>



<p>I heard a quote the other day that sums up how I feel about this year. <em>&#8220;This adventure has ruined me in the best way.&#8221; </em>If I was irresponsible before, I am more so now. If I was chafing at the bit last January, now I have worn it right through. I live close to the EastCoast Bike trail that journeys from Bar Harbor Maine to Key West Florida, and when I see the signs marking the route, I feel a growl welling in my chest and demanding to be released.</p>



<p>I miss the crickets in Idaho that are as big as a grown man&#8217;s thumb. I miss the coyotes that are circling the cattle in Wyoming. I miss the bears, snuffling along the bases of the Grand Tetons. I miss the kind man offering us a ride to the local bike shop even though it was 30 miles out of his way. I miss not knowing. I miss the wide open. It is hard to turn away. The world is out there just waiting.</p>



<p>I am writing a book about all this. Adventure, longing, parenting, kindness, and hope. It is the only way I can think of to keep the trip alive and feed whatever little beastie has awoken within me.</p>
