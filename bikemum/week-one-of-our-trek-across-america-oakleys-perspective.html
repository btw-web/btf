<p><g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace" id="9" data-gr-id="9">My first</g> week of my trek across America has its ups and downs (ha, ha). The first day we flew from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon, and the next day took a bus to Astoria, on the northwest tip of Oregon. We picked up our bikes and biked 18 miles from Astoria to our camp site in the middle of nowhere. Our bikes and bags were so heavy! When we finally got there, we set up our tent, started to make dinner, but then our camp stove blew up. It even burned the picnic table. What a great start to our trip, right? </p>



<p>The best part of the trip so far is that everywhere we go there is something new and amazing. The first night was awesome (besides our stove blowing up, but we just talked about that). The beach was really beautiful, and there were big sand dunes and an old shipwreck.</p>



<p>The low of the trip so far has been the hills and the traffic. It is horrible. On the fourth <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">day</g> we had to go over three huge mountains to get to our next camp site, and it was living hell for the two of us. By the end of the day we had finally made it, but we were sure to be severely sore the next morning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="blob:https://bikemum.com/4e9f68ed-1f0d-4483-bf38-3fe0b0cf39bd" alt=""/></figure>



<p>My favorite thing that I have seen so far is the wildlife and the many beautiful views. Most of the views are on top of the tallest mountains, so they are pretty hard to get to. I guess that makes me appreciate them more. So far, I am having a lot of fun on this trip, but I met a man who was finishing biking across America, going the opposite way as we are, and he said that I am going love it for a little bit, and then, for the next one thousand miles, I am going to want to quit. I&#8217;m pretty sure I didn&#8217;t want to hear that.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s Not Talk About Who Killed Who: Leah’s Perspective</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="4032" height="3024" src="https://i2.wp.com/bikemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3.jpeg?fit=660%2C495&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-961" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/bikemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3.jpeg?w=4032&amp;ssl=1 4032w, https://i0.wp.com/bikemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/bikemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/bikemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/bikemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3.jpeg?w=1320&amp;ssl=1 1320w, https://i0.wp.com/bikemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3.jpeg?w=1980&amp;ssl=1 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /><figcaption>Sand City Oregon</figcaption></figure>



<p>Okay, so maybe our stove did blow up on the first night, and maybe that was because partly due to the fact that the print on the directions was very tiny and complicated and required more attention than I am willing to give. Let’s focus instead on the fact that WHEN flames began to creep out from different parts of the stove, and then fully engulfed the stove, and then <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="6" data-gr-id="6">leapt</g> crazily out of control, and I had no choice but to scream for help. . . help came.</p>



<p>First, two fellow cyclists who were staying in the “Biker/Hiker Only” camping area came running. They were so nice! One of them tried to help by taking his life in his hands and trying to UNSCREW the canister of white gas from the stove to stop the flow. Let’s just say he had good intentions. Oakley was very excited as the inferno grew considerably, and the flames crept into the gas canister. The other cyclist also helped: by shouting at just the right moment, “It’s going to blow!”, and giving us the opportunity to run for cover. </p>



<p>I ran. To the ranger station, and as luck would have it, they had a fire extinguisher. It worked. My stove was melted beyond repair, but I did not burn down the old-growth spruce forests of Northern Oregon. And I made my first friends. </p>



<p>It is true that our learning curve has been as steep as the roads we have traveled. Whether it is learning how to cook responsibly, or the importance of showering immediately after every long day&#8217;s ride to prevent saddle sores, or how hills in the morning are a lot less arduous than hills in the afternoon, we are learning every second. Our brains are turned on and so are our bodies. Oakley has not complained once.</p>



<p>Oakley and I  have been cycling down the coast of Oregon for 5 days. It has been spectacular. The landscape is dazzling. We have hauled ourselves up through mountains of dense, misty forests with tremendous trees that drip with moss. We have raced down these same steep hills and been greeted by broad beaches, sand dunes and wind- and water<g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="8" data-gr-id="8">&#8211;</g>carved caves and arches. It seems the views change by the minute.</p>



<p>The people we have met along the way have been incredibly kind. There was Anthony, who was cycling from Washington to Mexico with his <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="9" data-gr-id="9">surf board</g> hitched to a trailer. He spent two nights sharing a tent site with us and swapping stories. There was Pete, who is cycling coast to coast with a boom box blaring heavy metal from his back rack. He offered us peanut butter tacos and a heavy dose of encouragement. There was Victoria, who had parked her car on the side of the road at a viewpoint on the side of the highway and handed Oakley $20 because he looked hungry, and she was impressed with our undertaking. And there was the blind farmer who gave us free cucumbers from his farmstand in the middle of the hot Oregon inland plains while laughing and shaking his head saying over and over, “You all crazy.” </p>



<p>I think we may be having the time of our lives. </p>
