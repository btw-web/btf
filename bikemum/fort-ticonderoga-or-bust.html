<h1>Fort Ticonderoga or Bust</h1>

<p>     This morning, bright and early, Oakley and I boarded the ferry, leaving our Peaks Island home and headed west. We will bicycle through the mountains of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York and then circle Lake Champlain, right up to the Canadian border.The total should be around 450 miles.</p>



<p>As we headed out, I felt both excitement and pre-expedition  jitters. Our last trip went so well that I feel a bit like we are tempting fate. I expressed my concerns to Oakley, but he would hear none of it.</p>



<p><br>“Oakley, there are going to be some huge hills. Did you see the elevation graph that shows the Kancamagus  Highway? We are going right up and over the White Mountains.”</p>



<p>“Mom, you know nothing is ever as bad as you think it is going to be.”</p>



<p>“Oakley, I’m nervous, are you?”</p>



<p>“Mom, we will be back in 10 days. That is nothing. “</p>



<p>“Oakley, it is supposed to be in the 90’s all week!”</p>



<p>“Mom, we will be fine.”</p>



<p>This time, Oakley is excited to go on our trip. He would never tell you that, because he a 17-year-old boy, complete with a diamond stud earring, silver chain around his neck and floppy Covid-hair that shields his eyes like a permanent visor, designed to hide all emotion, but it is true. This is his idea. He is excited for the adventure, a break from the confines of Covid and something else. Hopefully, we will figure out what.</p>



<p>As we peddle away from Portland, Oakley settles in behind me. The shoulders of the roads slowly transform from narrow margins of trash and car parts to clear and wide banners that beckon us to follow them away from schedules, bickering and stress that have been chafing us both. <br></p>



<p>“If you want to go in front of me you can Oaks.”</p>



<p>“No, I am feeling really peaceful back here.”</p>



<p><br>These words are like nectar , a sweet delicious balm. We ride in silence.</p>



<p>After some time we begin to smell lake water wafting through the trees and see glimmers of blue water peeking through. The air is humid and thick and we are covered in sweat and grime. Both of us focus on our legs pushing up and down and our breath, rythmic and hard like primed bellows. We stop at a  farm stand for lunch. We beg at a garden store for water. Memories from our last trip burble up and we laugh when we have air to speak again.<br></p>



<p>And now we are here. I am sitting on the side of the Saco river, drying after our dip in its cool tannin-colored waters that has made the sweat and grime nearly worth it.</p>



<p><br>Oaks has decided that he is not finished biking yet, and has rented a six-dollar-an-hour peddle car to explore our surrounding environs. Before he ran off to further exhaust himself, I called “Tomorrow will be big. Don’t over do it. We go over the Whites.”</p>



<p>“Don’t fret mom. You always fret. Live in the moment!” And he was grinning.</p>



<p>So I will. It is beautiful here and we are incredibly lucky. Tonight we will eat way too much macaroni, because we can. We will read out loud and listen to the waters sliding by. Oakley has left his phone at home. We will sleep under the stars. What could be better?</p>



<p>For those of you needing to stay at home during this difficult time, I invite you to come with us and read our story over the next 10 days. It will be true.<br><br><br></p>
