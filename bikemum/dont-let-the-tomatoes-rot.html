<p>There are several cucumbers that will need to be picked next week. The blueberries are just turning blue. The tomatoes&nbsp;are still green with just a shade of crimson. The carrots are coming along, but not quite. There will be peaches on the tree this year, and plums. </p>



<p>Our bee hives are brimming with bees, and the honey will need to be harvested in a little more than a month. The irises have come and gone, but not the gladiolas or the sunflowers that ring the garden&#8211;they are just budding.</p>



<p>What tastes better than the promise of a cucumber that isn&#8217;t quite ready to be harvested, or the new potatoes left undug? Nothing, I think. </p>



<p>Yesterday, as I drove Oakley home from his job as a junior counselor at Broad Turn Farm Camp, I found myself distracted. My head was full of lists and longings, and I was feeling homesick even though we have not gone anywhere yet. Maybe if I leaned on Oakley a little, he would lean back and it would make us both stronger.</p>



<p> &#8220;Oaks, I am really nervous about this trip. Are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221;  he admitted, shifting in his seat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which part?&#8221; I asked</p>



<p>&#8220;The whole thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oaks, I am too. I am going to miss Papa and Raven and Jonah and Finn and Cricket.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What about Scuppers?&#8221; (our cat)</p>



<p>&#8220;Him too. I am also going to miss my friends.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, me too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am going to need you, you know. It&#8217;ll be just the two of us out there.&#8221;</p>



<p>Oakley looked out the window, and I thought that my words had fallen on deaf ears. After a long pause he sighed.</p>



<p> &#8220;We will be okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was the first time he has tried to reassure me about this hare-brained idea of biking across America, and I felt my anxiety decrease by just a fraction. </p>



<p>&#8220;You think?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, we will just get homesick sometimes.&#8221; </p>



<p>The air in the car felt topsy-turvy with anxiety, excitement, and a new feeling of camaraderie, and I was reminded again of all the reasons why we are going. </p>



<p>There has been a poem bashing it&#8217;s way through my life since I was a teenager that says it far better than I ever could. </p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong> “A Summer Day”</strong></p>



<p><em>Who made the world?</em></p>



<p><em>Who made the swan, the black bear?</em></p>



<p><em>Who made the grasshopper?</em></p>



<p><em>This grasshopper, I mean the one who has flung itself out of the grass,</em></p>



<p><em>the one who is eating sugar out of my hand, who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down</em>,</p>



<p><em>who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.</em></p>



<p><em>Now she lifts her pale forearms and throughly washes her face.</em></p>



<p><em>Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.</em></p>



<p><em>I don&#8217;t know exactly what a prayer is.</em></p>



<p><em>I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down </em></p>



<p><em>into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,</em></p>



<p><em>how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,</em></p>



<p><em>which is what I have been doing all day.</em></p>



<p><em>Tell me, what else should I have done?</em></p>



<p><em>Doesn&#8217;t everything die at last, and too soon?</em></p>



<p><em>Tell me, what is it that you plan to do</em></p>



<p><em>with your one wild and precious life?</em></p>



<p><em>-Mary Oliver</em></p>



<p>I have purposely built a complicated life that is bursting with fullness. Stepping away from it is startling. I hate missing. I have never looked at a baby cucumber with more longing. I have never stared into my dog&#8217;s eyes with such adoration. I have never craved being surrounded by friends and family more. It is in the leaving that I am reminded of its worth. </p>



<p>While I am gone, I have a favor to ask of everyone. Please eat the cucumbers and the blueberries. Don&#8217;t let them rot. </p>



<p></p>
