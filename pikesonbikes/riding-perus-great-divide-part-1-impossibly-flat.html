<h1>Riding Peru&#8217;s Great Divide: Part 1 &#8211; Impossibly Flat</h1>
<p>Our route down Peru from Huaraz to Abancay was determined by one thing: taking the highest roads. From experience we knew this strategy normally provides great views, and our Google Earth planning seemed to confirm this. We would constantly be passing colourful lakes, often backdropped by snow-clad peaks. Not until a week into our journey did we realize that the roads we had chosen were continually hugging, or crossing, the Atlantic/Pacific watershed. We were riding Peru&#8217;s equivalent of the Great Divide.</p>
<p>On day 9 we made it to the main Lima-La Oroya highway, the Carretera Central. We were tired, but from speaking to locals, couldn&#8217;t work out why. According to half the people we chatted to all the roads we&#8217;d cycled had been flat.</p>
<p>We asked the shopkeeper in Yocchi what the road to Oyon was like. &#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s quite level, then descends to town.&#8217; (Just the 2500m of climbing then&#8230;)</p>
<p>We spoke to an alpaca herder in Parquin (midway into a 2000m climb, one of the most brutal we&#8217;ve ever encountered). &#8216;Your bikes look good&#8217;, he said, &#8216;how many gears have they got?&#8217; &#8217;27. But in these parts we only need our lowest one.&#8217; &#8216;Oh yes,&#8217; he nodded in agreement, &#8216;it is so very flat round here&#8230;&#8217;</p>
<p>When not being convinced that cycling across Peru&#8217;s vertical geography was akin to pootling through Zeeland, we were being told the dirt roads we wished to ride were impossible by bike. &#8216;Wait for tomorrow&#8217;s <em>carro</em>. Or, better, why not cruise down the pavement to Lima and take the Pan Am down south?&#8217;</p>
<p>But this wasn&#8217;t an option. Riding Peru&#8217;s Great Divide was simply providing us with too much fun.</p>

11 x 4000m passes</p>
<p>16 Triangulo Chocolate bars, 1.2kg of pasta and 6 litres of cola each.</p>

We bus to Conococha, having cycled that paving a few times before, then climb briefly to a small pass. Though we&#8217;re expecting the 3000m descent to Cañon to begin here this has to wait another day. This first day there&#8217;s an unexpected 1000m of climbing before Rajan.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Rajan, early morning" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411171705/"><img title="Rajan, early morning" alt="Rajan, early morning" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3753/10411171705_fe85ab1d6b_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We arrive in Rajan in the pissing rain, and fears surface that we&#8217;ve left our ride south too late in the season. En route to Rajan we are warned in 2 villages that the Rajanites are a bad, unfriendly lot. Which of course turns out to be untrue. Neil did have some uncomfortable moments fending off kisses from a drunk campesino in the main square though&#8230; The graffiti is of an educational kind. &#8216;He who studies, triumphs!&#8217;</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Descending to Cañon" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411320333/"><img title="Descending to Cañon" alt="Descending to Cañon" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2891/10411320333_921365ae0f_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In the bright morning sun we descend the 2300m to Cañon. Slicing through hillsides, the scenery is on a scale too vast to contemplate.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Still descending to Cañon" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411174566/"><img title="Still descending to Cañon" alt="Still descending to Cañon" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5545/10411174566_f91fe7ba71_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Descending into the depths of (Gran) Cañon we barely pedal for 40km. Gliding above we spot more condors than in the whole of our 5 months in the Cordillera Blanca.</p></div>

The descent has to accommodate numerous photo stops and takes over 2 hours.</p></div>

<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Home made mini-skirt" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411165984/"><img title="Home made mini-skirt" alt="Home made mini-skirt" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3823/10411165984_db2593e449_c.jpg" width="533" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">And just as climb follows descent, hanging on the wall next to the depiction of the Last Supper is sure to be a titty calendar. Or, in the more respectable establishments, a scantily clad gringa advertising some ironmongers of transport firm. But maybe the backlash has begun. Here in Cajatambo someone had covered this chica&#8217;s modesty by making a paper mini-skirt for her!</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="The October rains have come" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411322423/"><img title="The October rains have come" alt="The October rains have come" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5517/10411322423_40f26f49d2_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The October rains have come. Fortunately the climb to Abra Pacomayo only has a few puddles, and no mud.</p></div>

It&#8217;s never long in this part of the world at this time of year before the lovely photogenic clouds turn to lightning-spitting cumulonimbus though.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Descending from Paso Pacomayo" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411179965/"><img title="Descending from Paso Pacomayo" alt="Descending from Paso Pacomayo" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7413/10411179965_72f5fedcb2_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We begin the short descent from the pass and soon reach a junction. Rather than consult our GPS which has the track Neil has planned on Google Earth, we just assume the wide road with the good surface leads to Oyon, the district capital. Turns out it doesn&#8217;t, though it takes a while for the pin to drop. We climb back up for an hour and take the muddy track to Oyon. A 2 second glance at the GPS would have seen us take this in the first place.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Laura, Haz, Karina" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411190706/"><img title="Laura, Haz, Karina" alt="Laura, Haz, Karina" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5511/10411190706_ceac215d34_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The blue skies turn nasty. Just in time to hide from a violent hail storm we reach Karina&#8217;s huts and shop. She turns out to be well educated and super-friendly. We put up our tent by her hut, are invited in for food and drink, and hear about how terrible she found living on the coast when she had to go there during a difficult pregnancy. Soon after Genesis, her beautiful smiling baby, was born 8 months ago she moved back up here, to the back end of la nada.</p></div>

<div style="width: 544px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Pay your bills now!" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411335593/"><img title="Pay your bills now!" alt="Pay your bills now!" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2882/10411335593_9302a9ccf2_c.jpg" width="534" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pay your bills now! The notice reads: to all villagers of Cashaucro, please pay your water and electric bills for 2011, 2012, 2013 by this Saturday or it&#8217;ll all be cut off! The debt collection systems in this part of the world put British Gas&#8217; to shame.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="You ain't seen me, right?" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411183455/"><img title="You ain't seen me, right?" alt="You ain't seen me, right?" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7372/10411183455_a7b46e0539_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You ain&#8217;t seen me, (scoffing all the borachitos) right? These tasty, rum-laced cakes have been a staple of our Peruvian diet for months now. The moment we reach Oyon at lunchtime on day 4 we raid the cake shops.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="A typical Peruvian road" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411273905/"><img title="A typical Peruvian road" alt="A typical Peruvian road" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7431/10411273905_7b86013a8f_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The following day and we&#8217;re climbing again on a typical Peruvian road.

We&#8217;d been sceptical as to the existence of the road, but it was very much there. The village turns out to be a friendly, interesting and quite large place. Unlike in Ancash, there are old buildings around &#8211; this colonial church survived the devastating 1970 earthquake. We bump into a miner whose mum lives in the street next to us in Vichay. Even in the immense Peruvian cordillera, the world is a small place.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="The quebrada near Huancahuasi" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411275104/"><img title="The quebrada near Huancahuasi" alt="The quebrada near Huancahuasi" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3767/10411275104_c6db755043_c.jpg" width="533" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From Rapaz we descend 1000m down a fascinating quebrada, towered over by these rocky ribs &#8211; hundreds of metres high. At night we camp at the Huancahuasi hot springs &#8211; nothing like a soaking in some iron and cobalt waters to reinvigorate the legs! Turns out they need reinvigorating. The following day&#8217;s climb is a beast.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Some non-threatening afternoon clouds, for a change" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411289446/"><img title="Some non-threatening afternoon clouds, for a change" alt="Some non-threatening afternoon clouds, for a change" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2812/10411289446_33d472da70_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Some non-threatening afternoon clouds, for a change. We admire them from the thermals.</p></div>

<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="This, and one moto, was the only traffic we saw all day" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411277184/"><img title="This, and one moto, was the only traffic we saw all day" alt="This, and one moto, was the only traffic we saw all day" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3784/10411277184_f1e9207b76_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Then begins the 1900m climb to Abra Chucopampa. In Oyon everyone insisted there was no road over this pass to Vichaycocha. There is, and it&#8217;s brutal. Loads of sections over 10%, and in the mud at the top we were having to pause every 30 seconds to catch our breath. It&#8217;s been a while (well, our last time in Peru) since a pass has kicked our asses so badly. These sheep, and one moto, were the only traffic we saw all day.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Pastel colours near Punta Chucopampa" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411278605/"><img title="Pastel colours near Punta Chucopampa" alt="Pastel colours near Punta Chucopampa" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5522/10411278605_e527b0da48_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Near Punta Chucopampa the pastel coloured rocks give plenty to amuse the eye on our frequent rests.

It starts raining, and we&#8217;re invited in again for some lunch with Johan&#8217;s family. They&#8217;re from the town of Huayllay (founded by Geordie settlers in the mid-18th century) but are embarking on a quieter life in Chungar. They&#8217;ve built a small house and are beginning to set up a trout farm on the lake. With about 4 neighbours and almost zero traffic on this road, we hope they&#8217;ll be happy in all the silence up here.</p></div>

<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Camp at 4700m near Punta Fierro Cruz" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411301956/"><img title="Camp at 4700m near Punta Fierro Cruz" alt="Camp at 4700m near Punta Fierro Cruz" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5543/10411301956_63fb071b5b_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">But it&#8217;s late, so we camp at 4700m near the top. Expected lake views never materialize as it hails and snows much of the night.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="A chilly morning descending from Punta Fierro Cruz" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411302286/"><img title="A chilly morning descending from Punta Fierro Cruz" alt="A chilly morning descending from Punta Fierro Cruz" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2891/10411302286_c9e2392eb4_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The morning ride is somewhat chilly. And, dare we say, slightly miserable. As ever, we&#8217;re grateful for our mountaineering gloves.</p></div>
<div style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Heading for the main road at Alpamarca" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411302346/"><img title="Heading for the main road at Alpamarca" alt="Heading for the main road at Alpamarca" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5526/10411302346_55499d455a_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Then comes the only flat section of road between Huaraz and Huancavelica. All 5km of it, following a water channel. It&#8217;s muddy, then becomes muddier as we join the main Tanta-Huayllay road for a while &#8211; plenty of mine traffic on this section.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="The church in Yantac" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411448803/"><img title="The church in Yantac" alt="The church in Yantac" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3777/10411448803_08dbdf12fb_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Leaving the muddy main road, there&#8217;s a lovely stretch past more lakes and some snowy peaks to Yantac. At 4650m this is the highest village we&#8217;ve encountered in Peru. One side of the Plaza is this lovely church&#8230;</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Yantac's Plaza de Armas" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411293575/"><img title="Yantac's Plaza de Armas" alt="Yantac's Plaza de Armas" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7323/10411293575_820969cd10_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8230;while the middle of the square is dominated by this. It&#8217;s difficult not to fall in love with sculptures of such undeniable beauty.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Early morning in Marcapomacocha" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411304476/"><img title="Early morning in Marcapomacocha" alt="Early morning in Marcapomacocha" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3819/10411304476_dbac9e11ee_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We continue for an hour to Marcapomacocha on a day which saw plenty of sun, and on which we were overtaken by 10 hailstorms. We&#8217;re wet and chilly again, but knocking on the Mayor&#8217;s office door leads to the keys to this pseudo-grand hotel being produced. Over and over again in Peru we&#8217;ve seen big plans not being completed; the money always seems to run out with 95% of the job done. Fortunately this isn&#8217;t the case with roads in this country, which are inevitably excellent. Almost every 1-llama-village has a rideable road to it.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Halt! Under order to shoot" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411450833/"><img title="Halt! Under order to shoot" alt="Halt! Under order to shoot" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7306/10411450833_159b728f04_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The next day, our Google Earth planning reveals a weakness. After crossing a 4800m pass we descend 400m, then take a small road we know leads over an even higher pass to the main, paved Carretera Central. But after 150m of climbing we reach a barrier across the road and this sign. &#8216;Halt! Under order to shoot&#8217;, it reads. We continued anyway, reasoning they wouldn&#8217;t bother getting the firearms out for a couple of cyclists. Plus, we&#8217;re climbing at such great speeds (3.5-4.5kph) that we thought it unlikely that any of the security men would be good enough shots to harm us&#8230;</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Being turned back in Mina Londres" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411307506/"><img title="Being turned back in Mina Londres" alt="Being turned back in Mina Londres" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3760/10411307506_d11aeda5a2_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">But then we get to the mine buildings. These guys were willing to let us pass through, but the angry security boss arrives and tells us very firmly that this is a private road, and we must turn around now. Not sure why Neil&#8217;s looking so happy here as we lost more than half a day returning back over Punta Seis Lagos for the normal route to the Carretera Central. In the first minute on this horrible road we see more traffic than in the previous 9 days combined. Fortunately it&#8217;s a quick 30 minute downhill whizz until we turn off the paving again&#8230;.</p></div>
