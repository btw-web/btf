<h1>Riding Peru&#8217;s Great Divide: Part 2 &#8211; The Sound of El Silencio</h1>
<p>When heading out on rarely used dirt roads we&#8217;ve been asked a few times if we&#8217;re not afraid of &#8216;<em>El Silenci</em>o&#8217;. That haunted silence which reigns in Peru&#8217;s wonderful mountain wildernesses. It&#8217;s hard for Peruvian <em>campesinos</em> to understand that it&#8217;s <em>El Silencio</em> that we&#8217;re here for. Where we come from it&#8217;s oh soo hard to find.</p>
<p>What we are afraid of is &#8216;<em>El Sonido</em>&#8216; (the Sound) &#8211; that rumbling of thunder which usually begins around 14:00 and has plagued both our Peruvian cycling trips. (Yes, we know it&#8217;s our own fault for being here in October again&#8230;). It was the reason <a title="Hunting High Peruvian Passes" href="https://pikesonbikes.com/hunting-high-peruvian-passes-puno-arequipa-cuzco-apurimac-210-281110/" target="_blank">we curtailed our last trip</a> in this stunning country in 2010, when the terrifying lightning storms made us turn around at Abancay. This year our visas run out too soon to enable us to reach Bolivia by pedalling alone, so we&#8217;ll bus from Abancay. For those looking for dirt road adventures, 6 months is nowhere near long enough to explore Peru&#8217;s myriad of remote cycling opportunities.</p>
<p>Plus, the storms are here again. Fortunately not as powerful as 3 years ago, but they&#8217;ve still put an early end to many of our cycling days. As blue skies suddenly give way to towering cumulonimbus and the flashes begin, rubbish camps have become somewhat habitual. Though puddles and muddy roads are becoming all too frequent, ironically a lack of water sources has recently led to some slightly tainted cups of coffee and aniseed tea. After Punta Pumacocha we were left drinking from a scummy pond when the roaring arrived; the following day Neil was to be found syphoning ditch water from a muddy hairpin bend&#8230;</p>
<p>But the riding in between is more than making up for these minor inconveniences. And how. Our vertical route down Peru surpasses in beauty almost any other route we&#8217;ve ever taken.</p>
<p>After 6 days, and a few tough, tough climbs, we made it from the Carretera Central to Huancavelica. This pleasant provincial capital had been a milestone in our ride for a while. Each night in the tent we&#8217;d work our how many passes still separated us from &#8216;Old Huanky&#8217;; horizontal kilometres didn&#8217;t seem to mean so much any more.</p>

It&#8217;s one of hundreds in these parts &#8211; most lakes have a trout farm &#8211; and the freshly caught fish is a delicious treat. In the morning comes the long climb to 4930m Punta Ushuayca. It&#8217;s a lovely quiet road, and we&#8217;re left to weave all over it as we please. Which is just as we like it.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Nearing Punta Ushuayca" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411527073/"><img title="Nearing Punta Ushuayca" alt="Nearing Punta Ushuayca" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/10411527073_2dbd2acee0_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nearing Punta Ushuayca the road steepens and the surface goes a bit muddy. Here&#8217;s a haggard looking Neil&#8230;</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Punta Ushuayca (4930m)" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411375965/"><img title="Punta Ushuayca (4930m)" alt="Punta Ushuayca (4930m)" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3789/10411375965_e60e790c31_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8230;and here&#8217;s a knackered and slightly psychotic looking Haz.</p></div>
<div style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Descending from Punta Ushuayca" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411371904/"><img title="Descending from Punta Ushuayca" alt="Descending from Punta Ushuayca" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3817/10411371904_598b540201_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">At the top of the pass we meet the day&#8217;s second and last vehicle; a truck headed for Tanta. As we take photos it descends, but we soon catch it on the first hairpin. Rather than turning the corner, it has slid down it, and the front left wheel is perilously close to going over the edge. Some careful rock placement and desperate reversing later it makes the turn, only to repeat the performance a few more times before reaching the valley floor.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Full concentration needed on the climb to Punta Suija" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411374004/"><img title="Full concentration needed on the climb to Punta Suija" alt="Full concentration needed on the climb to Punta Suija" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3827/10411374004_e53e900e95_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The descent from Punta Ushuayca immediately turns into the climb to Punta Suija. Though this is a short one at just 500m, the surface is bad and requires full concentration. Haz manages to force her way pedalling to the top, while Pike&#8217;s combination of no weight at the front of his bike, and inherited poor balance means he&#8217;s left pushing some short sections. Still, as this is the only pushing required on the roads between Huaraz and Huancavelica we&#8217;re quite satisfied; we&#8217;d readied ourselves for more.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Nearing Punta Suija" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411440996/"><img title="Nearing Punta Suija" alt="Nearing Punta Suija" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7397/10411440996_e712156e78_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nearer the top of Punta Suija the terrain eases and we&#8217;re able to look around at all the lakes and snowy peaks (out of shot to Neil&#8217;s left) on show.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Descending from Punta Suija" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411533683/"><img title="Descending from Punta Suija" alt="Descending from Punta Suija" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3781/10411533683_2ccceaf44f_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The descent from the pass is on a beautiful road which leads to Tanta. On the way a 10m climb breaks us and we realise we&#8217;ve gone way into the red. A stop to eat all our remaining chocolate puts things to right.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="The track along the Rio Cañete ends" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411382055/"><img title="The track along the Rio Cañete ends" alt="The track along the Rio Cañete ends" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3816/10411382055_b17f7a64db_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">After Tanta, Google Earth shows its good and bad sides. The town we&#8217;re heading for is labelled as &#8216;Carhuamachay&#8217; on GE, but our requests for directions to this place draw blank looks. But we know what the village looks like &#8211; it&#8217;s at the end of a lake, by some pretty waterfalls. &#8216;Oh, you mean Vilca?&#8217; And yes, we do. But, more importantly, GE marks a road from near Tanta, along the Rio Cañete straight to Vilca. Looking closely at the satellite photos revealed this doesn&#8217;t actually exist&#8230;</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Riding to Vilca" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411536513/"><img title="Riding to Vilca" alt="Riding to Vilca" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3817/10411536513_87af5081c5_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8230;but it does give us the idea to try and bike-hike the route, avoiding a 50km detour over two passes. Usually we wouldn&#8217;t shun the possibility of going over a few high passes, but this bike-hike is just too tempting.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="We become troglodytes for the night" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411437866/"><img title="We become troglodytes for the night" alt="We become troglodytes for the night" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3740/10411437866_d11c524bff_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Particularly when you get the opportunity to become troglodytes for the night. Another thing ticked off our &#8216;To do&#8217; lists. We took refuge in this well-kept cave at 16:00 when a thunderstorm arrived. By 18:00 it was still going, so we pulled out our sleeping bags onto the nice insulating hay.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Nearing Vilca" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411378684/"><img title="Nearing Vilca" alt="Nearing Vilca" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3774/10411378684_773067d26d_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The sun was out (as usual) in the morning, and we are delighted to find much of the chaquinani to Vilca is rideable.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Rounding Papacocha near Vilca" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411538663/"><img title="Rounding Papacocha near Vilca" alt="Rounding Papacocha near Vilca" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7381/10411538663_87966e27a2_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Laguna Papacocha appears, near Vilca.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Above Papacocha" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411425645/"><img title="Above Papacocha" alt="Above Papacocha" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7441/10411425645_f3c4260c1e_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">And we&#8217;re able to cycle all the way round it and to the 4WD track which begins in the village.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Laguna Papacocha" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411388015/"><img class=" " title="Laguna Papacocha" alt="Laguna Papacocha" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2810/10411388015_0625a2508f_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The shortcut saves us a day&#8217;s riding, and Vilca is indeed as idyllic a spot as GE had implied. With an old Colonial bridge to boot, the road from town leads down the Rio Cañete valley&#8230;</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="The upper Rio Cañete" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411576113/"><img title="The upper Rio Cañete" alt="The upper Rio Cañete" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7297/10411576113_27ddaa126b_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8230;which becomes a highlight of our route.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Sport Ancash's biggest hincha" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411389335/"><img title="Sport Ancash's biggest hincha" alt="Sport Ancash's biggest hincha" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7374/10411389335_1fa2413df5_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rather than a bog-standard river, it turns out to be a series of sapphire lakes, punctuated by waterfalls. Sport Ancash&#8217;s biggest fan scoffs some snacks while taking it all in.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="The upper Rio Cañete" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411419285/"><img title="The upper Rio Cañete" alt="The upper Rio Cañete" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7316/10411419285_1a0364ee3e_c.jpg" width="533" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We&#8217;d never heard of the valley, but it&#8217;s known to Limeños &#8211; a couple of the villages lower down have numerous accommodation options. It&#8217;s easily accessed from the coast on a (mostly) paved road.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="The Rio Cañete" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411389465/"><img title="The Rio Cañete" alt="The Rio Cañete" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3724/10411389465_bec34ae098_c.jpg" width="533" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The day we wrote this post we were sent an email from the Lonely Planet about the most beautiful landscapes in the world. One of them was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plitvice_Lakes_National_Park" target="_blank">Plitvice Lakes</a> in Croatia, which in photos look just like Rio Cañete, only on a much smaller scale. Wikipedia says the Croatian lakes span 7km and drop 130m. We&#8217;d estimate these ones dropped about 200m over 12-15km.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Climbing to Punta Pumacocha" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411546233/"><img title="Climbing to Punta Pumacocha" alt="Climbing to Punta Pumacocha" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2831/10411546233_3f13971847_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">After dragging ourselves away from the cruise down the Rio Cañete, a downpour drenches us on the climb to Laraos. We stay in the municipal guesthouse then set off at 05:45 the next morning, hoping to beat the bad afternoon weather to the top of Punta Pumacocha.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Punta Pumacocha comes into view" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411572813/"><img title="Punta Pumacocha comes into view" alt="Punta Pumacocha comes into view" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2836/10411572813_18d61dd8e0_c.jpg" width="533" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s a spectacular climb, but near the top becomes savagely steep. Here&#8217;s Haz despairing when the pass comes into view (it&#8217;s the L of the two low points on the ridge). Only 2km away in a straight line, it&#8217;s still 450m above us &#8211; the most intimidating looking pass we&#8217;ve ever seen.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="At 4800m on the climb to Punta Pumacocha" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411406366/"><img title="At 4800m on the climb to Punta Pumacocha" alt="At 4800m on the climb to Punta Pumacocha" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2820/10411406366_a02c2c3b2f_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">But the surface has been recently &#8216;cleaned&#8217;, and to our amazement it&#8217;s all rideable. At 4600m my cycle computer registers a gradient of 23% &#8211; the steepest it&#8217;s ever given in 4 years of ownership. Neil plays hare, pedalling hard for a few hundred metres then resting. Haz&#8217;s impressively slow tortoise pace sees her crawl up at 3.5kph.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="On 4990m Punta Pumacocha" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411404856/"><img title="On 4990m Punta Pumacocha" alt="On 4990m Punta Pumacocha" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5502/10411404856_ab51eafec7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">At noon, and after 6 hours of climbing we reach Punta Pumacocha. Our GPS says we&#8217;re at 4990m &#8211; 40m higher than the reading on Google Earth, but then the gradient on the north side is near vertical.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Beginning the descent from Punta Pumacocha" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411414704/"><img title="Beginning the descent from Punta Pumacocha" alt="Beginning the descent from Punta Pumacocha" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5518/10411414704_5d85662c6b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s a relief to have made it to the pass; the top 4km are at an AVERAGE gradient of 10.5%! Not the easiest thing to climb when you&#8217;re at nearly 5000m&#8230;</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Heading for Mina Don Mario" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/10411570113/"><img title="Heading for Mina Don Mario" alt="Heading for Mina Don Mario" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7417/10411570113_bea1147685_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The south side isn&#8217;t nearly as steep, but the surface is pretty awful until we reach this lake and have some lunch. Then comes a flattish section to Mina Don Mario. Fortunately there&#8217;s no one around there, so we sneak through the mine and climb to the next pass.</p></div>

Some people!</p></div>

It&#8217;s small for a departmental capital, and is a charming place. Lots of old buildings around, and very little traffic on the streets. The Mayor of Huaraz could do with making a visit here and taking some notes &#8211; the settings and sizes of the two towns are quite similar, but Old Huanky seems to do a far better job with traffic, rubbish and dogs.</p></div>
