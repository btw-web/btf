<h1>Montenegro, Croatia and the Breast Artist in the World</h1>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EsrgLZ0fJG8/SP81zDKLTPI/AAAAAAAAABo/kxwQ0I2xr3E/s1600-h/DSC00571.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_EsrgLZ0fJG8/SP81zDKLTPI/AAAAAAAAABo/kxwQ0I2xr3E/s320/DSC00571.JPG" alt="" border="0"></a>We&#8217;d just settled down to lunch halfway up a hill in Montenegro when we were joined by a lycra-clad cyclist. He introduced himself as Tiho &#8220;that means &#8216;the quiet&#8217; in Montenegran&#8221; before loudly proclaiming &#8220;I am the best artist in the world!&#8221;.<br />Whilst he donned more clothing for the cold descent back to his town of Cetinje he handed us a book of his work that he just so happened to be carrying around with him.<br />It soon became apparent what Tiho&#8217;s inspiration was. The Breast.<br />We flicked through pages of single breasts, pairs of breasts, flying breasts, breasts disguised as droplets&#8230; There were a few bums thrown in for good measure, but it was pretty clear that Tiho was definitely a breast man.<br />(If any of you have been wondering how to fill that blank wall-space, or are simply curious, we&#8217;re sure all your breast-art needs will be satisfied at www.tiho.me )</p>
<p>As Haz dodged our landlord&#8217;s kisses and embraces later that evening in Kotor, it did cross our mind&#8217;s that all Montenegran men were perverts.</p>
<p>After a wander round the picturesque old walled town of Kotor, which was still fun despite being swamped by tourists and so lacking in atmosphere we felt like we were on a film set, we headed up the Dalmatian coast to another much-hyped old town, Dubrovnik. There we rested a day (mostly watching Beverly Hills 90210 in our apartment) before deciding we&#8217;d had enough of the tourists, the 5GBP an hour internet and the flat coast and headed inland to Bosnia.</p>
