<h1>Snow Views in Rupshu</h1>
<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on">Trekking peaks abound in the Tso Kar/Tso Moriri area, and as we find it hard to resist a nice high altitude trek it had always been our plan to try climbing a few. </p>
<p>But we hadn&#8217;t reckoned with the fickle Rupshu weather. September is meant to be a good, stable month, weather wise, but this was not so in 2012. Every day we had sun, every day we had rain. Most days we saw hail, and many nights snow fell.</p>
<p>In the event we only climbed one peak, the 6,390m Spangnak Ri. Steep scree slopes covered in fresh snow made for slow, tiring, going, and at the top the cloud was so thick that we were having to prod the ground with our ice axes to check it was indeed snow and not just thin air. Summit photos are unspectacular.</p>
<p>Five days later we set off to climb 6,500m Chalung to the north of Tso Moriri, but suffering from colds we turned back, still on our way to a high camp, when the hail and snow rolled in. We felt like wimps, but (Neil) just didn&#8217;t fancy a trudge up in powder snow when the prospects of a nice view from the summit weren&#8217;t that high. </p>

Like we had done many times in the Andes when climbing mountains we pushed our bikes off the road and just dumped them behind rocks before heading off on foot with rucksacks. This time we only had to push about 500m off the very quiet road to Tso Moriri &#8211; fortunately this is one of the few very sparsely inhabited areas of India!</span></td>
