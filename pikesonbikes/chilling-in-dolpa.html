<h1>Chilling in Dolpa</h1>
<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on">The 1970s Dolpa of Peter Matthiessen&#8217;s &#8216;<i>The Snow Leopard</i>&#8216; intrigued us. Though his writing style and long religious ramblings were hard to plough through, the descriptions of this wild land, its Tibetan people, yaks and God-awful cold were fascinating. In 2007 we made a mental note to visit one day. </p>
<p>The modern world has made slight inroads into the Dolpa of 2012, but much of Matthiessen&#8217;s world is still unchanged.  Old men in traditional cloaks pass you on the trail with a nod, too busy chatting into their Nokias for a proper <i>Namaste </i>or <i>Tashi Dele</i>. Each village now has a basic homestay or lodge, and occasionally a coconut biscuit wrapper litters the trail. Adidas trainers are all the rage among the over 60s; the cool kids stick to Converse. </p>
<p>But the rest is as it was: an inhospitable, wild landscape that made for our toughest trekking in Nepal. Over a week from the nearest roadhead, for the first time in the Himalaya we found the kind of remote, unpopulated areas we&#8217;ve been searching unsuccessfully for all trip.  Many days in Upper Dolpa we saw no people. Others we only passed yak caravans carrying illegal timber from more temperate zones to the treeless areas to the north.</p>
<p>In early November the bone-chilling winter cold had already arrived and this came to dominate our Dolpan time. The locals were emptying out of higher villages, heading down to more agreeable climes &#8211; it soon became clear we&#8217;d left our trek a few weeks too late for comfort. The moment the sun left in the afternoon we had to camp, the wind making it too unpleasant to continue. We dared not leave our tent in the morning before the sun hit for fear of taking all day to thaw our fingertips. Worse, in our 4+ season sleeping bags we were unable, for the first time ever, to stay warm, as the -25C temperatures penetrated our hitherto trusty down and layers of thermals. </p>
<p>Compounding this was our temperamental <i>MSR Whisperlite</i> stove. Struggling on dirty Nepali kerosene its unreliability drove us round the bend. The &#8216;blue flame&#8217; appearing sparked jubilation and we celebrated with delicious, real <i>Nescafe 3-in-1</i>, but more frequently &#8216;orange flame depression&#8217; brought torrents of swearing, stove dismantling, numb fingers and accompanying rage. </p>
<p>Slightly haggard and with hacking high altitude coughs, it was with relief that we descended to the tourist circuit at Jomsom.</p>

We also became quite sick of instant noodles. Twice a day for 9 days in a row &#8211; yuk. By the end we were eating them raw, having decided they were less nausea-inducing that way.</span></td>

In Dolpa we were chilly almost every night, but at least the sun was hot in the day. One memorable lunchtime we were basking in its rays and Neil spilt some water on his trousers, which were in the shade. It froze instantly. Other days whilst camping, a thick layer of ice would form in our pots in the 1 minute it took to transfer water from a river to our camp.</span></td>
