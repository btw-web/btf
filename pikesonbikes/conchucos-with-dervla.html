<h1>Four feet in Conchucos</h1>
<p>Dervla Murphy is one of our travel heroines. Stubborn as a mule and unwilling to embrace the modern world she may be, but with this comes a woman as hard as nails; one who is willing to venture anywhere, no matter how difficult or dangerous others perceive it to be. Provided there&#8217;s a bar with cold beer at the end, of course.</p>
<p>We often find ourselves travelling in locations she visited decades, or even half a century ago. No doubt many would be unrecognizable to her aging eyes and she wouldn&#8217;t enjoy the stark change from quiet mountain village to far-noisier-mountain-village-with-newly-built-road.</p>
<p>In 1978 she walked with 9 year old daughter Rachel, and Juana the mule, from Cajamarca to Cusco. (Her captivating book about the journey, <a href="http://www.dervlamurphy.com/eightfeetintheandes.html" target="_blank">Eight Feet in the Andes</a>, is a travel classic.) Predating the Sendero Luminoso, her trip traversed the impoverished Peruvian Andes, where many campesinos were struggling to survive droughts and famine, and agrarian reform had caused huge upheaval. The merry band&#8217;s route crossed the Callejon de Conchucos (Dervla wanted to avoid the Callejon de Huaylas, having heard that Huaraz had a nascent tourist scene!), and to this beautiful and much quieter side of the Cordillera Blanca we set out on a couple of off-the-beaten-path treks.</p>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Chacas' new church" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9462787020/"><img title="Chacas' new church" alt="Chacas' new church" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7300/9462787020_b33b8a9756_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chacas&#8217; new church. This is one of the regions prettiest towns, with a precious, grassy main square. Italian monks arrived here in the &#8217;70s and have helped ensure the architecture remains reasonably traditional and that the plaza isn&#8217;t concreted over like in many other towns in the area.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Chacas' main square" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9460006675/"><img title="Chacas' main square" alt="Chacas' main square" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5495/9460006675_ce06d79a72_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chacas&#8217; Plaza de Armas. Not much goes on here, but it&#8217;s easy to lose a day or two chatting to the locals and sipping Pilsens, whilst admiring the fine local woodcarving on the surrounding buildings.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Breakfast menu" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9462787070/"><img title="Breakfast menu" alt="Breakfast menu" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7361/9462787070_6c85d125d7_c.jpg" width="533" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chacas is not blessed with good restaurants however. Caldo de Gallina is one of our least favourite breakfasts &#8211; we&#8217;re not great fans of chicken foot soup&#8230;</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="A pedal-less bike in Chacas" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9460007341/"><img title="A pedal-less bike in Chacas" alt="A pedal-less bike in Chacas" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3780/9460007341_8a2e193453_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A pedal-less bike in Chacas. Probably used by some old dude to roll back home after a day in town. No need to lock things up in any of the small villages round here &#8211; crime is extremely rare.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="The Cristal sign clearly put up after a few too many..." href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9462789518/"><img title="The Cristal sign clearly put up after a few too many..." alt="The Cristal sign clearly put up after a few too many..." src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7344/9462789518_5147df9099_c.jpg" width="800" height="479" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">After sampling the brew and deciding it was fine, Pablo decided to erect an upside-down advertising sign. The multi-coloured maize drying on a balcony is much more of a common sight in Conchucos than in the Callejon de Huaylas.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="The trek from Chacas to Huari" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9460009215/"><img title="The trek from Chacas to Huari" alt="The trek from Chacas to Huari" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2860/9460009215_f1835e2502_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We finally leave the charms of Chacas and head off on the 2 day trek to Huari. It turns out to be by far our most boring walk in the Blanca. No snowy peaks on show, just the one lake. Some nice rock strata and plenty of ichu grass, but not the usual visual treat we&#8217;ve become accustomed to in this area.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Vote Condor!" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9460008829/"><img title="Vote Condor!" alt="Vote Condor!" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5331/9460008829_caa538ed65_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">After a night in a hostal on Huari&#8217;s main square (which unfortunately coincided with a fiesta (not that unfortunate in reality, seeing as most days seem to be celebrated round here) and concert which continued till 04:00 at decibel levels rivalling The Who at The Valley) we fail to find transport to Mallas. This turns out to be a blessing in disguise: the bucolic walk there is as charming a few hours as we&#8217;ve had in Ancash. Until we foolishly follow a short cut shown on our map and lose half a day. This shot is taken in the lovely village of Yacya, where all and sundry were supporting local Nazi-esque Condor Alberto.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Chinchey on the climb to Quebrada Rurichinchey" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9462793654/"><img title="Chinchey on the climb to Quebrada Rurichinchey" alt="Chinchey on the climb to Quebrada Rurichinchey" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2858/9462793654_5503663a0d_c.jpg" width="533" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hours after we should&#8217;ve turned round, we give up battling the overgrown trail and take the long way back round to Mallas. Dervla was constantly getting into pickles with shortcuts (&#8216;reduras&#8217;). Her stubbornness meant she rarely turned round &#8211; preferring to send Rachel ahead to scout a way out of any mess they found themselves in. On our path she probably would&#8217;ve just pulled out a machete and opened up the overgrown path again. In this shot, Nevado Chinchey (one of the highest in the Blanca) puts in a rare appearance.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Looking down to the Rio Mosna" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9460012431/"><img title="Looking down to the Rio Mosna" alt="Looking down to the Rio Mosna" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5464/9460012431_073834c05b_c.jpg" width="533" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Looking down to the Rio Mosna. The triangular rock slabs in the picture are incredible, particularly when viewed from the road at their base. Hundreds of metres high and almost totally smooth, Dervla describes it as &#8216;one of the most spectacular geological formations I&#8217;ve ever seen.&#8217;</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Hunter in Quebrada Rurichinchey" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9462789554/"><img title="Hunter in Quebrada Rurichinchey" alt="Hunter in Quebrada Rurichinchey" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7382/9462789554_4c6e566631_c.jpg" width="533" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">After a few hours of seeing no-one, we are passed by a blood splattered donkey with a cow&#8217;s head strapped to its back. Then another appears with some limbs tied on, then a third with some body parts. Behind them all was this friendly guy. &#8216;I shot it from 20m&#8217; he tells us.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="In Quebrada Rurichinchey" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9460013083/"><img title="In Quebrada Rurichinchey" alt="In Quebrada Rurichinchey" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2886/9460013083_d115e12488_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Quebrada Rurichinchey is well off the usual trekking trail. Up at the top of the valley, we meet no-one for a couple of days.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Rio Rurichinchey" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9462792770/"><img title="Rio Rurichinchey" alt="Rio Rurichinchey" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7446/9462792770_594c261433_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Like many in the Blanca, the river running through the valley is stained orange by iron.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Descending from Lagunas Rurichinchey" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9460011835/"><img title="Descending from Lagunas Rurichinchey" alt="Descending from Lagunas Rurichinchey" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7350/9460011835_1ee6b3e84d_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A route is shown on our maps to Lagunas Rurichinchey, but we&#8217;ve long learned not to trust the small paths marked. At first we think there&#8217;s no way up to the lakes, until we find a tiny path that snakes up through a forest, rounding some cliffs. Parts were far too narrow for cattle, but when we emerge at the top pampa by the lakes there&#8217;s a herd of cows up there nonetheless. Incredible mountaineers these beasts!</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Sunset and Tullparaju's southern summit" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9460010573/"><img title="Sunset and Tullparaju's southern summit" alt="Sunset and Tullparaju's southern summit" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3828/9460010573_e90e0a6e91_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A few days later and we&#8217;ve walked round into neighbouring Quebrada Rurec. Fiery clouds glow above Tullparaju&#8217;s southern summit.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Nevado Cayesh" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9460010231/"><img title="Nevado Cayesh" alt="Nevado Cayesh" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2830/9460010231_94dff480d7_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We climb up to Laguna Yuraccocha (about the 3rd lake of that name we&#8217;ve visited in the Blanca &#8211; with over 250 lakes in the range it&#8217;s not that surprising that some names get repeated) and gaze at Nevado Cayesh. In a photobook in Huaraz we&#8217;ve seen pictures of this mountain from another angle &#8211; it is so unbelievably steep when viewed from the other side that not even a child would dare draw a peak with such outrageously inclined sides.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Descending from Laguna Yuraccocha and Nevado Cayesh" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/9462792040/"><img title="Descending from Laguna Yuraccocha and Nevado Cayesh" alt="Descending from Laguna Yuraccocha and Nevado Cayesh" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5463/9462792040_86688837dd_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lake seen, we descend down Quebrada Rurec to Huantar &#8211; a lovely little town dubbed the &#8216;Balcony of Conchucos&#8217; which perches high above the main road. To our delight, there&#8217;s regular enough traffic to enable us to reach Huaraz that evening and gorge ourselves at El Horno &#8211; the finest pizza in town. Dervla would not have approved. She wasn&#8217;t such a fan of the Huaraz &#8211; Chavin road which had such a drastic impact on the character of tranquil old Conchucos.</p></div>
