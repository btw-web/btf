<h1>Back in Bumpy old Bolivia</h1>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t our first visit to Bolivia&#8217;s inhospitable Sud Lipez region. As true Gringo Trailers eleven years ago we zoomed through on a four day jeep tour. Then, in 2010, we pedalled through with a sense of awe. The &#8216;Lagunas&#8217; route is a challenge most cyclists feel they must complete on a journey along the Andes. Beforehand we pored over maps, gleaned information from other cyclists&#8217; blogs and psyched ourselves for the toughest ride of our lives. Then, we were surprised to find that though the roads were corrugated and sandy and the wind exhausting, the fabled &#8216;Lagunas&#8217; route wasn&#8217;t as tough as it was built up to be. Jeeps seemed to pass continually. This was no wilderness route, and navigation wasn&#8217;t tricky. As <a title="Amaya" href="http://www.worldbiking.info/wordpress/2011/04/cycling-southwest-bolivi/">Amaya</a> mused when cycling here,  &#8216;Getting lost in southwestern Bolivia &#8230; is about as likely as getting lost on your way to the supermarket.&#8217;</p>
<p>Despite the jeeps, we loved the wide open spaces and went on to explore the Bolivian highlands for a further two months, then decided this year to come back for more. But a return to Bolivian roads came as somewhat of a shock after the well maintained surfaces in Peru. Our selective amnesia had remembered the big skies, cone-shaped volcanoes and colourful lakes but eliminated the bumpy discomfort. Or maybe the surface on the route through San Pablo and Quetena was just worse&#8230;</p>
<p>On a Bolivian road you rarely have time to look around. Eyes need to remain fixed on the few metres ahead to negotiate the next obstacle. Sometime it&#8217;s corrugations; sometimes sand. Ocassionally it&#8217;s rocks. Or a river, thrown in just for fun. We found ourselves wondering what a different experience cycling here would be if the roads were improved; or even paved. Looking around to enjoy the scenery would be possible. All routes would take half the time. You&#8217;d hardly have to carry any food and water. But perhaps we all traipse to this corner of the world for the <a title="Pedaling Nowhere - Misery Index" href="http://www.pedalingnowhere.com/plog/the-misery-index-cycle-touring/#.UpEd59JFXSs">misery</a> factor?</p>
<p>We also pondered what cycling Sud Lipez would&#8217;ve been like before it was on the the gringo to-do list. Was this yet another destination that it&#8217;s now &#8216;too late&#8217; for? Now in the tourist honeypot of San Pedro we can&#8217;t help but wonder what a potty business tourism is. If we travel to discover new cultures and experiences why do touristy places continually evolve to become more like back home? Why do we demand coffee and pizza when we&#8217;re in the middle of the driest desert on Earth?</p>
<p>Hmmmm coffee&#8230;&#8230;</p>

Not for the first time in Bolivia the thought &#8216;Can you imagine living here?&#8217; lodges in our minds. This place has a sad number of half wits and mentally retarded residents and even watching perfectly &#8216;with-it&#8217; shopkeepers battling to calculate how much change we&#8217;re due is enough to make you want to weep. Rarely on our travels have we encountered a country where the mental arithmetic is so poor &#8211; back in 2002 we remember being struck by it.</p></div>
