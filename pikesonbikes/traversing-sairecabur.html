<h1>Traversing Sairecabur: An Adventure with Anna (the biking Ninja)</h1>
<p>We&#8217;ve never fallen in love with San Pedro de Atacama, despite its evident charms. One of them being that bikes are the most common form of transport. Another being that it&#8217;s the launch point for some wonderful trips into the mountains to the east &#8211; <a title="Andes by Bike" href="https://andesbybike.com/chile/routes/san-antonio-to-san-pedro/" target="_blank">Paso Sico</a>, or the <a title="Andes by Bike" href="https://andesbybike.com/bolivia/routes/san-pedro-to-ollague/" target="_blank">Bolivian Lagunas</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Recently (on GE, surprise surprise) we spotted another exciting looking route from town: climbing up 5980m Cerro Sairecabur to 5500m, traversing for 5km across its vast crater, then descending a small track on the south side of the mountain, which heads towards Laguna Verde, before veering right, past Licancabur, back to town.</p>
<p>Having met <a href="http://www.wishfish.org/" target="_blank">Anna </a>in Huaraz, then again in Uyuni, we were delighted to find her camping in San Pedro, and that for once our plans could coincide for a few days. One of the grittiest people we&#8217;ve ever met, Anna has been enjoying way-off-the-beaten-track adventures for years now, since setting off from Alaska in 2009. Being another who puts a healthy dose of ripio into her porridge every morning, this loop was right up her street, and we were pleased that no convincing was needed to persuade her to come along on the trip.</p>
<p>It turned into a good&#8217;un.</p>
<div style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="The road to Sairecabur" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/11120590716/"><img title="The road to Sairecabur" alt="The road to Sairecabur" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7331/11120590716_316a196120_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From San Pedro at 2400m, it&#8217;s a 60km climb up to the Universidad de Chile telescope at 5540m on Sairecabur. It begins nice and gently with 30km of hard dirt, which is as good as tarmac.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Heading for Sairecabur" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/11120593836/"><img title="Heading for Sairecabur" alt="Heading for Sairecabur" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3815/11120593836_7c9db364a5_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">To the mountain turnoff at 4300m the gradients are mostly gentle. There is this one short, steep section however.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Heading for Sairecabur" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/11120563065/"><img title="Heading for Sairecabur" alt="Heading for Sairecabur" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2859/11120563065_ec59736f07_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">After 44km of near constant climbing we decide to camp at 4450m, right by the track in a spot that will get some nice early sun. The summit of Sairecabur is the breast-shaped hump on the left of the shot. Its huge crater into which the road climbs is to the right.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Anna, climbing to Sairecabur" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/11120742143/"><img title="Anna, climbing to Sairecabur" alt="Anna, climbing to Sairecabur" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2847/11120742143_cec3272e4d_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In the morning the climb continues. The surface is reasonably good, though a constant thin layer of sand makes forward motion harder than it otherwise would be.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Pushing past the penitentes" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/11120739613/"><img title="Pushing past the penitentes" alt="Pushing past the penitentes" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3791/11120739613_8a7831a304_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">At 5400m the road ceases to be motorable. To this point it had been almost completely rideable, but at this height penitentes block the road&#8217;s switchbacks, and it becomes too steep to ride.</p></div>

And on Mars, apparently.</p></div>

<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="The end of the motorable road on Sairecabur" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/11120644096/"><img title="The end of the motorable road on Sairecabur" alt="The end of the motorable road on Sairecabur" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5514/11120644096_57a145c4ed_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When penitentes block the road, the jeeps make new shortcuts. Some of them are quite steep &#8211; two people are needed to shove each bike up the hill. (Neil promises he was holding the camera horizontal for this shot.)</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Descending from the refugio on Sairecabur" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/11120789143/"><img title="Descending from the refugio on Sairecabur" alt="Descending from the refugio on Sairecabur" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2823/11120789143_27fcb1b4d9_c.jpg" width="800" height="573" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We reach the telescope in mid afternoon and set up camp. In San Pedro we were given some excellent information from the cheery guys at <a title="Cumbres 6000" href="http://www.cumbres6000.com/" target="_blank">Cumbres 6000</a>, but despite this we&#8217;re still not exactly sure about the route up the mountain, so continue up the road to 5670m where a path leads off from a small refugio. The way forward is now clearer.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Not many firm footings round here..." href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/11120620025/"><img title="Not many firm footings round here..." alt="Not many firm footings round here..." src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2811/11120620025_0c5fd1979f_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">But it turns out to be on horribly loose sand and rocks. Anna is feeling the altitude from our high camp and decides to stay in the tent while we head up to the summit. Probably a good idea &#8211; mountain boots and walking poles are necessary up here &#8211; equipment she didn&#8217;t have with her.</p></div>

It&#8217;s a rough scramble over boulders to get to the 5980m top&#8230;</p></div>
