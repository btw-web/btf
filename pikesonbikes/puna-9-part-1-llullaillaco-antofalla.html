<h1>Puna 9: Part 1 &#8211; Llullaillaco and Antofalla</h1>
<p>For remoteness, San Pedro to Antofagasta easily trumped anything we&#8217;d previously pedalled. Leaving the Argie border guards at Paso Socompa we each stocked up with 17 litres of mineral water, then turned south for Llullaillaco. Still with 14 days of food aboard, for the first time ever our steeds weighed in heavier than us.</p>
<p>This provisioning proved necessary; the roads and jeep tracks our GPS led us down were as wonderfully beautiful and deserted as anticipated. More so, in fact. No chance encounters with miners handing out fresh fruit. No 4&#215;4 tourist expeditions eager to assist with snacks and drinks. We saw not a soul for eight days. In this time we dragged our bikes to the foot of mighty Llullaillaco, dominant peak of the northern Puna, summitted, then continued southeast, crossing salar after salar. The tracks were tricky, rarely used, often sandy. Herds of vicuñas, covering vast distances each day between water sources, were our only company.</p>
<p>This remoteness was liberating. Usually we thought it thrilling; occasionally daunting. With no phones, or tracking device, if anything were to go amiss it would be a long old traipse for assistance.</p>
<p>A brief reentrance into the grand sphere of humanity came in the most unlikely of places &#8211; we espied a pickup truck parked at Volcan Antofalla high camp at 5350m. Soon joined by its four occupants, we chatted a few minutes as they packed up camp. They&#8217;d just made the 10th ascent of the volcano in the past decade. The following day we made the 11th.</p>
<p>Mountains climbed, all that was left was to reach Antofagasta. A swim through sand to Caballo Muerto was followed by descent to sad little Antofalla. Only tourism or mining can save this dying village. The young are leaving, and who can blame them? There&#8217;s a whole world out there. And here? <em>No hay nada.</em></p>
<p>16 days out of San Pedro we rolled into Antofagasta&#8217;s eerily quiet plaza. Chuffed, but tired, a much needed three day weight-gain programme was soon initiated.</p>

It weighed in at just under 29kg (between us).</p></div>

Then we left Peine, the last Chilean village, and the surface deteriorated as the temperatures soared. Though we left Peine with 10 litres of water each, which we expectedto last 2.5 days to the border, we soon realize this is nowhere near enough. In the heat of the day, Neil&#8217;s cycle computer registers 49C (we know this &#8216;has no scientific meaning&#8217;, but include it partly as an interesting fact-let, but mostly just to annoy Neil&#8217;s dad). Finding this concrete structure with some leaky pipes was therefore quite exciting.</p></div>

This was one of the most charming &#8211; we camped by it on our third day.</p></div>

Though we&#8217;d already obtained our Chile exit stamps in San Pedro (the immigration guys there had just assumed we were leaving via Paso Sico), we&#8217;d been told by some officials that the Argies might not let us in. We needn&#8217;t have worried. This is the small graveyard at Socompa, with the volcano of the same name behind.</p></div>

All added up to 65-70kg, including the bici. And some people always tour with bikes this heavy? Ugh.</p></div>

From here it&#8217;s gentle and easy to 6730m, and some more Inca ruins. As far as we know, this is the highest archaelogical site in the world. The last 20m (in the photo) to the summit are a bit rocky, but we&#8217;re on the top by 10:45.</p></div>

The surface improves, we can ride it all again. The colours are fabulous (we promise we haven&#8217;t touched up any of these shots on the computer).</p></div>

We see our second car in 11 days. It&#8217;s sportier that the usual 4x4s you see in this area.</p></div>

In those days the residents stayed, but now the young know what they&#8217;re missing&#8230;</p></div>

It&#8217;s not long before we stop for an early bulghur wheat lunch. And for Haz to fix her rear derailleur which was bent in a fall on day 3 (Pike: (having not seen an animal in 2 days) Ooh look, a fox!; Haz: Where? (Looks left, falls off bike in the sand)). For 10 days her lowest gear wouldn&#8217;t work, and we didn&#8217;t want to risk bending the derailleur in the middle of nowhere, in case it snapped. But some careful pressure bends it back into position and 1:1 begins working again, sort of.</p></div>

Though we&#8217;ve eaten well for 15 days, we haven&#8217;t eaten nearly enough. Pike is heard to mutter that he&#8217;s &#8216;slowly starving&#8217; on a number of occasions. (On reaching Fiambala a few weeks later, the pharmacy scales prove he was only slightly exaggerating.)</p></div>

When it begins raining (I mean, on the Puna, really) we set up camp.</p></div>

We really would love to know why these beasts insist on running across in front of any vehicle or cyclist that passes. Is it a game? Is it a dare? If anyone knows the reason, please let us know &#8211; it&#8217;s something that really puzzles us.</p></div>

On Day 16 we made it to Antofagasta, and this is all that was left of the original 29kg. We were both ravenous, so went out in search of cake and ice cream. Neither of which could be found&#8230;.</p></div>
