<h1>Puna 9: Part 4a &#8211; Pissis (a traverse)</h1>
<p>Cycling to high mountains on the Puna is the best preparation we know of for making an ascent. It renders the trip as a whole far tougher and longer (though more rewarding), but by the time you reach the base of a peak legs and lungs are strong, and most of the hard work is already done.</p>
<p>The 90km dirt road ride to Pissis was typically challenging, but also a joy. Colourful lakes dotted the landscape, and old friends like <a title="Nacimiento" href="https://pikesonbikes.com/nacimiento-6478m-provincia-de-catamarca-argentina/">Nacimiento</a> and <a title="Walter Penck" href="https://pikesonbikes.com/cazadero-walter-penck-6684m-provincia-de-catamarca-argentina/">Walter Penck</a> hovered on the horizon to the north. On arrival at the foot of the Andes&#8217; third highest peak we were feeling good, so decided to try a traverse of five of the mountain&#8217;s many peaks (the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th and 8th highest &#8211; which are the most prominent summits when approaching from the north, as almost all climbers do). This idea had first been suggested to us by Corax in 2011, but the idea had never manifested into an attempt. When it was again raised by avid <em>Atacamist</em> Bruno Baschung in an email before we left Fiambala we felt our current fitness and acclimatization levels meant it would be silly not to go for it. As far as we know the traverse has only been achieved <a title="Pissis page" href="http://nevadopissis.com.ar/volcan/2011/04/capitulo-xv/" target="_blank">twice</a> before, so we were excited at the thought of such an undertaking.</p>
<p>Setting off from a 5750m high camp at 06:30 we were on Gendarmeria Argentina, the first and lowest of the summits, by 10:15. An icy tailwind then propelled us east through the soft snow, up and over the Main, Samore and UPAME tops to the 6800m Pissis East summit, which we reached at 16:30. Here the radiant sunshine gave way to snow clouds and we descended through light flurries for two and a half hours. Not until this interminable descent did we truly appreciate the size of this huge volcano.</p>
<p>We descended all the way to 5450m to avoid crossing the large glacier, whose few crevasses have tragically claimed lives in the past decade, then quickly climbed the 300m back up to our tent for a celebratory hot chocolate and a few handfuls of trail mix. It had been a good day&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>The following morning we retraced our steps to the bikes and began what we knew would be the hardest part of this 15 day excursion: the long push to Bonete&#8230;</p>

Ideally we&#8217;d have liked a few more days of recuperation, but after some enormous storms while we&#8217;re in town the forecast for the mountains suddenly turns good. Hay que aprovechar! Having cycled the Fiambala &#8211; Coipa road a few times before, Jonson gives us a lift up the paving to the Pissis turnoff. Here begins a pleasant, and quite steep, 1000m+ climb.</p></div>

(As an aside: The power of the Lonely Planet always interests us. A whole chapter in the Bolivia book about the Sud Lipez lagunas, and the area is chocablock with jeeps and dust. Just a throwaway sentence at the end of the absurdly short Catamarca section of the Argentine tome means days of solitude. This province gets about 4 pages in the Argentina book &#8211; we&#8217;ve spent over 4 months biking and hiking in this, our favourite of Argentina&#8217;s 23 provinces. The scenery in Catamarca is just as spectacular as in the Lipez, more so, we think.)</p></div>

For this area it&#8217;s a comparatively popular tour to do by jeep &#8211; usually receiving a couple of tourist vehicles a week on day tours from Fiambala.</p></div>

It&#8217;s not in the same league of difficulty as other routes we&#8217;ve taken previously (those near the Salar de Archibarca and Volcan Peinado spring to mind), but there&#8217;s still a bit of pushing to be done. About 5km in total, though much of this is due to the fact we set off with 18 days food and have all our kit on the back of our bikes. This means we&#8217;re doing huge wheelies (of the &#8216;front wheel ends up vertically above your back wheel&#8217; type) when the gradient cranks up. Still, this poor weight distribution is worth it as it means we can leave our front panniers in Fiambala &#8211; we really don&#8217;t want them for what&#8217;s to come.</p></div>

In the morning it&#8217;s a pleasant walk up to a 5750m high camp.</p></div>

At 6400m we move onto snow and head for the col between the first summit (Gendarmeria Argentina &#8211; 6690m, on the R) and the main summit (6800m). Before the col we make a bit of a boob and leave our bags at 6580m to climb up to the Gendarmeria Argentina top and back. Turns out that though this looks like a real summit from this vantage point, it&#8217;s actually got a prominence of about 5m, and it would be much easier to just go over the top, descend 5m to the col, then continue on to the main summit. We have to go back for our bags, which means an unneccessary 100m descent. Oh well&#8230;</p></div>

As it has been all day the wind is cold and we don&#8217;t want to take gloves off for very long &#8211; just long enough in fact to take a few hurried, rubbish photos. This is looking south to our next targets &#8211; Bonete (L) and Veladero (centre).</p></div>

The perfect sunshine here gives way to snow clouds, so we don&#8217;t hang around long. Pike scribbles our names on a bit of paper and puts them in a little tin which is stashed under the summit cairn.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Pissis East - the 5th summit, at 16:30" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/12371866364/"><img title="Pissis East - the 5th summit, at 16:30" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2892/12371866364_8cb755e252_c.jpg" alt="Pissis East - the 5th summit, at 16:30" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Summit number five. The three highest tops are virtually all the same height, with our GPS giving them as Main (6802m), UPAME (6804m), and East (6801m). We believe that surveys carried out in 2007 do confirm that the Main peak is indeed actually the highest, though it&#8217;s a close run thing.</p></div>
<div style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Descending from Pissis East/Ejercito Argentino summit (6800m)" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/12371566973/"><img title="Descending from Pissis East/Ejercito Argentino summit (6800m)" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/12371566973_2ac5821af4_c.jpg" alt="Descending from Pissis East/Ejercito Argentino summit (6800m)" width="600" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Then comes the long descent. Beforehand in Fiambala Jonson warned us not to cross the glacier, and with fresh snow around this seems like good advice. So we descend 1350m, down to the bottom of the glacier and snow at 5450m. Here we leave our crampons and ice axes, to be picked up in the morning, and begin the 300m climb back to our tents.</p></div>
<div style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="Back at camp" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/12371866834/"><img title="Back at camp" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5508/12371866834_42ab4f6587_c.jpg" alt="Back at camp" width="600" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We&#8217;re feeling tired by this stage (though nothing like as shattered as on many cycling days this Puna trip) but our legs are still strong, so it&#8217;s less than an hour back up to our tent. Near our yellow little home we meet two tent loads of acquaintances and by the time our chats are over it&#8217;s 20:25. Soon the stove is roaring and the brews are on. Hot tea and warm handshakes all round. We&#8217;re happy that there&#8217;s no need for us to both squeeze into that sleeping bag Pike was carrying in case we had to bivvy!</p></div>

Jonson left it the day before, as he happened to be passing. Though we already have water with us, much of it is of the salty-wormy type, so we&#8217;re quite grateful.</p></div>

Not even the most cunning of creatures could get through our rock defences. We sort loads, piling all weight we can into rucksacks, remove pedals, then set off on the long push to Bonete&#8230;</p></div>
