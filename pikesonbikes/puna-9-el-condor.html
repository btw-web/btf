<h1>Puna 9: Part 2 &#8211; El Condor</h1>
<p>Our immediate problem in Antofagasta was finding Pesos. After a fruitless search we visited the cops, listened to a rant against La Presidenta (&#8216;<a href="https://www.google.com.ar/search?q=cristina+fernandez+images&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t2HYUrbWDovNkAfGtYGYDw&amp;ved=0CCkQsAQ&amp;biw=1360&amp;bih=676" target="_blank">Hot Lips</a>&#8216; as we like to call her) and then were led into one of those fortunate encounters which seem to occur in Argentina. The boss suggested we visit Anibal &#8211; &#8216;he&#8217;ll change your dollars&#8217;. He did, and more. An experienced mountain guide he was also a cyclist, and a mine of information about our route ahead. Where jeep drivers told us the way was fine, he&#8217;d put them right. &#8216;They&#8217;re on bikes! It&#8217;s all sand round there. They&#8217;ll be pushing for hours!&#8217; Truths such as these make for far more useful mental preparation. He opened his home to us, we watched the Disney Channel with his kids. Then we resumed our journey.</p>
<p>As with the previous fortnight&#8217;s riding, it was wild and empty. Intoxicating, addictive. Our biggest challenges were a lack of water and an abundance of sand. The jeep tracks we pedalled and pushed existed, usually, though on occasion had clearly been forged, but not followed. It was tough, but fun.</p>
<p>Later than expected we were in position to dump our bikes and wander to Condor. Though the 23rd highest peak in the Andes (officially it&#8217;s 6410m, though we think probably a bit higher) this peak has been virtually ignored by <em>andinistas</em>, due to the trickiness of the short approach from Paso San Francisco, and the fact that old surveys mark it as being far lower than its true height.  As late as 1996 it was still apparently unclimbed, and ours was maybe the eighth ascent, possibly the fifth.</p>
<p>On day 8 our average speed suddenly spiralled upwards as we reached the paving and zoomed down to the Argentine immigration post at Las Grutas. A cheery <em>buenas tardes</em> to the policemen there didn&#8217;t roll off the tongue as fluently as usual, but then it had been a while since our last non-inter-Pike interaction, bidding farewell to Anibal as we cycled out of his front gate all those days ago&#8230;</p>

At the end of Day 1, we manage to find a stinking, filthy puddle hidden among this greenery, and stock up with 15 litres each. It&#8217;s a good decision &#8211; the only non-salty water we find on the whole route, and enough to sustain us until the penitente fields on El Condor, still 3 days away.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="IMG_3713_1067x800" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/11716442713/"><img title="IMG_3713_1067x800" alt="IMG_3713_1067x800" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7424/11716442713_3187073270_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From Antofagasta it&#8217;s a 1000m climb to a 4400m pass, after which comes this lovely descent to the Salar de Ratones.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="IMG_3395_1200x800" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/11716490964/"><img title="IMG_3395_1200x800" alt="IMG_3395_1200x800" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7335/11716490964_fbff0faf89_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We don&#8217;t see any mice in the area. Just lots of dreamy Puna colours.</p></div>

The &#8216;main&#8217; way hits this 200km-long, but very slender salar further north and would mean many more kilometers. We&#8217;re not surprised when our smaller route throws up a few pushes.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="IMG_3739_1067x800" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/11716180755/"><img title="IMG_3739_1067x800" alt="IMG_3739_1067x800" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5497/11716180755_ab7638db26_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">But the descent is something of a surprise. 750m in just over 6km. The steepest bits are at over 40% and it takes both of us holding onto a bike to get them down safely, one at a time.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="IMG_3752_1067x800" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/11716548084/"><img title="IMG_3752_1067x800" alt="IMG_3752_1067x800" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7448/11716548084_f99afce3ea_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The hillside is so steep that it&#8217;s not always clear which way the jeep drivers have actually managed to get their 4x4s down. The odd recce is needed to see how to proceed.</p></div>

After a beautiful, cloudless and stormless December to date, things seem set to change, with a predicted week of storms and snow. We can well believe it as we continue descending to the salar &#8211; things look gloomy to the south with dark clouds hovering over Peinado, and obscuring El Condor.</p></div>

Here all signs of 4x4s disappear (&#8216;So that&#8217;s why we couldn&#8217;t see anything on the satellite images&#8217;) and there&#8217;s a few kms of cross country to get to the southern end, from where we know a route heads up towards Laguna Peinado.</p></div>
<div  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a title="IMG_3429_1200x800" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43023674@N02/11716139345/"><img title="IMG_3429_1200x800" alt="IMG_3429_1200x800" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3697/11716139345_0e9df67041_c.jpg" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The slushy salt didn&#8217;t do our bikes much good, but there were loads of these cool &#8216;salt bubbles&#8217; around.</p></div>

It&#8217;s far enough to reach the western flanks of Volcan Peinado, where we dump our bikes. El Condor (out of sight to the right) lies beyond a 400m deep hollow in which languishes Laguna Amarga (Bitter Lake), and Anibal has told us there&#8217;s no point taking the bikes down there and closer to the mountain. The push out would be soul destroying. Most jeeps that descend into the hollow are unable to climb back out the same way, and so face a detour to the north of around 200km to get out and back to this point!</p></div>

As we&#8217;re continuing our journey by bike over to Chile after a rest in Fiambala, we hitch down to this wonderful little town. It takes less than half an hour to get a lift (which beats our previous record on this road &#8211; took us nearly 24 hours to get a ride the only other time we&#8217;ve tried hitching!). Back in civilization it&#8217;s not long before we raid the local wine cellars&#8230;then reflect on one of the toughest, most beautiful, most rewarding routes we&#8217;ve ever ridden. Though ridden is probably the wrong term. Of the 26 hours our cycle computer says we were moving to complete the 190km from Antofagasta to Las Grutas, we&#8217;re pretty sure more than half of them were spent pushing through sand!</p></div>
