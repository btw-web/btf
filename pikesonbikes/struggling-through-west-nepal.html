<h1>Struggling through West Nepal</h1>
<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on">
<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><span>On previous backpacking trips Nepal had been a haven. A place we could flee to and escape the stresses of travel in India. Once, our patience having snapped in rural Maharashtra, we&#8217;d jumped on a 40 hour train ride just to cross the border and bask in that &#8220;&#8230;aaaaand relax&#8230;&#8221; feeling. We loved the easy going nature and humour of the people and the stunning mountain scenery.</span></p>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>To our surprise our first few weeks this time were different.</p>
<p></span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>Uttarakhand had presented no hassles, and few difficulties. The cycling was easy, though hilly; the people were friendly and trustworthy; the roads were quiet. West Nepal, we soon found out, was more trouble. </span><span>Firstly, steep roads and bad surfaces made for challenging cycling, and hours of pushing. But this bothered us  less than the second reason: that we could never get any peace. </span><br /><span><br /></span><span>The West is the poorest and most troubled part of a poor country, and family sizes are large. Having seven (invariably beautiful) brothers and sisters is nothing unusual. </span><span>At every meal or drink stop we&#8217;d be surrounded and watched by twenty pairs of eyes. </span><span>As we cycled into each village a cry of &#8220;Saikal! Saikal!&#8221; would go up, and from all directions kids would come running. And though they always came with</span> big smiles it became irksome. B<span>eing chased by gangs of kids as you struggle uphill is funny for a while, but when you acquire a new band of followers every 15 minutes it&#8217;s hard keeping the “Namaste”s and smiles going. Especially when little hands start hanging onto your bike.</span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, the further into West Nepal we delved, the more it became apparent that alcoholism was a big problem in these parts. Each day we&#8217;d be pestered by people who&#8217;d had one <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raksi" target="_blank">raksi </a></i>too many. Usually they&#8217;d be friendly enough, but we became weary of being asked for money and hearing drunken dreams of relocating to America: that Shangri-La, that utopia where all are happy and everyone is rich.</span><br /><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>All this meant we could never truly relax until we locked our bedbug-ridden hotel room at night. Then, in the shabby roadside town of Ramghat our accommodation hit an all-time low. A filthy cave room with hard wooden bed which came with complimentary drunken idiot trying to break in during the night. Once we&#8217;d barricaded the flimsy door shut with panniers he sat outside for hours, muttering about America, Barack Obama, dollars we should give him, then occasionally (and the only time we were even slightly amused) he&#8217;d scream &#8220;Mikhail Gorbachev! Mikhail Gorbachev!&#8221;. The<span> </span><i>Fast Show</i>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh8CQRerBVA" target="_blank">Rowley Birkin</a> had nothing on this guy.</span><br /><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>The next day on the Karnali Highway we didn&#8217;t set off in the best of moods, and they only grew worse. The &#8216;road&#8217; was 5cm of dust concealing fist sized rocks beneath. The vehicle of choice was the tractor. At lunch the local kids wouldn&#8217;t stop fiddling with our bikes, and when we set off again neither of us could get our low gears to work on the steep climbs. A unanimous consensus was reached: &#8220;F&#8211;k this.&#8221;</p>
<p></span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>We jumped on the roof of a bus to Surkhet.</p>

<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div><span>P.S. Moan almost over. </span><span>Of course it wasn&#8217;t all bad. There were great moments like having 2 kids flying kites run alongside us, giggling for half an hour with sheer unbridled joy. Or taking our bikes in a canoe across the Karnali, when we arrived on its banks to find no bridge. Chatting to the ex Congress MP for Mangalsen about his experiences during the Maoist war; the lovely <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaba" target="_blank">dhaba </a></i>owners who kept plying us with tasty food. But there was something about the atmosphere in a number of places that we just didn&#8217;t like, and we met more unpleasant individuals here than anywhere else we&#8217;ve ever travelled.</span><br /><span><br /></span> <span></span></p>

We didn&#8217;t mind the lack of restaurants as there were more than enough dhabas like this one serving delicious food. The lack of hotels was more of a problem &#8211; as we never felt comfortable enough to camp we stayed in some very basic, bedbug-ridden hovels.</span></td>
