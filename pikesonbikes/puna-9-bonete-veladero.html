<h1>Puna 9: Part 4b &#8211; Bonete and Veladero</h1>
<p>As the condor glides it&#8217;s 30km between Pissis and Bonete, the Andes&#8217; third and fourth highest peaks. By road it&#8217;s more like 600km. But one of the advantages of the easy angled, rolling Puna is that it&#8217;s possible to pick a route between two points from satellite pictures and then just go cross-country. There&#8217;s no danger of encountering a raging, unfordable river or an impassable ravine.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">From the north side of Pissis we wound our way into a shallow </span><em style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">quebrada</em><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">, then pushed, and at times carried, our bikes for a day and a half to a 5650m pass. The descent led us into a valley so pristine and remote that we could well have been convinced it had never before been trodden by man. Except that we were continually coming across footprints in the sand from a group of Poles who&#8217;d made a rare ascent of Bonete from the north the week before.</span></p>
<p>Another day and a half of pushing saw us reach the 4&#215;4 tracks to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=corona+del+inca&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C1TEUA_enGB466GB466&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lMUDU__wE9KzsATuooGYCw&amp;ved=0CCsQsAQ" target="_blank">Corona del Inca</a>, and these we followed to the base of Bonete. The summit morning was bone chillingly cold, but at the top the sweeping panoramas made up for numb hands and frozen noses. All the pushing had sapped our energy however, so we were sluggish on this climb, finding it more tiring than any of our previous ascents.</p>
<p>The following day we took a poorly planned route, which needlessly crossed many ridges, to the base of Veladero, the last of the peaks on our Puna 9 adventure. By this time our energy had returned and in the morning we climbed quickly from a 5200m camp to the Inca ruins on the summit. Our ninth successful ascent this season! All thirteen 6400ers on the Puna climbed!</p>
<p>Two months ago we thought our chances of achieving this ambitious goal were slim, but some good acclimatization, plenty of sweat, and a bit of help from Pachamama with the weather, and we&#8217;d done it! And, more importantly, we&#8217;d enjoyed it too. No disillusionment, or wishing we hadn&#8217;t set such an arduous goal.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, on the two day cruise down to Villa Union we couldn&#8217;t help feeling glad that we were done with the inhospitable Puna for now. No more mushy pasta or drinking of dish water. It was time for ice cream and steak, wine and a shower. A bit of a rest and then more plans to return to this incredible area will no doubt begin to be hatched.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s for the future. For now it&#8217;s time to begin our journey back to Huaraz and that other Andean love of ours &#8211; the Cordillera Blanca.</p>

Camp is 1200m below the summit, but less than 3km away in a straight line. Constant 45-50% slopes make for a fast climb.</p></div>
