<h1>Empty Everest</h1>
<p>&#8216;<i>How odd that there are no tourists here</i>’, I said to Harriet for the fiftieth time. As she&#8217;d wandered round Namche looking for a room I’d lazed on some steps in the main street. Half an hour had passed and still not a single Leki pole-toting soul had marched past. Likewise on the wander down from Thame that morning. <i>I know the nights are cold, but they&#8217;re not </i>that <i>cold. Where is everybody?</i>’The contrast with the bustling trekkopolis we’d seen some Novembers back was startling. Were it not for the rows of shuttered outdoor shops we could easily have been convinced we weren’t in the trekking hub of the Everest region at all. Some days later we crossed a grey Renjo La. Everest was blanketed in cloud. Near the pass we met three German trekkers, our sole encounter with foreigners between Namche and Gokyo.</p>
<p>In Gokyo it snowed. The temperature fell to -20C, or possibly -25C; we weren&#8217;t sure, having inadvertently crushed our thermometer near Thame. The next night was colder still. This must be what was keeping the others away.  We huddled round the yak-dung stove and spent hours chatting to our fascinating hostess, Pasang Futi. She&#8217;d started selling tea to trekkers who began appearing in her yak pastures in the 1970s, and from these humble beginnings had built a colossal lodge catering to 100 guests in high season. There were only four of us there.The weather cleared. We climbed Gokyo Ri, making a path through fresh snow to the top. For a serene hour we had the place to ourselves. Not a sound but our footsteps and the light fluttering of tattered prayer flags in the breeze.</p>
<p>We crossed Cho La, made trickier than anticipated by our fatigue and the slippery, snowy boulder fields. We met no-one on the path until Dzongla.</p>
<p>We hot-footed to Kala Patthar and lazed by the weather station in the hot sun. We were the only ones there.</p>
<div><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">We crossed Kongma La, again in the sun. The scale of the mountains was mind-blowing. The trail was deserted.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>We descended to Namche, our high altitude trekking at an end. Tempted though we were to continue east over Amphu Labsta and Sherpani Col, the weather was changing. Waning were the clear skies of November, December and January, to be replaced by February&#8217;s snow and sleet. With heavy hearts we settled on a lower route to the Sikkim border.</span></div>
