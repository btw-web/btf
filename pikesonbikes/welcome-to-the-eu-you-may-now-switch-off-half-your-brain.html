<h1>Welcome to the EU (You may now switch off half your brain)</h1>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EsrgLZ0fJG8/SSASA38lXdI/AAAAAAAAACg/VOsIz4Gby4U/s1600-h/DSC00688.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_EsrgLZ0fJG8/SSASA38lXdI/AAAAAAAAACg/VOsIz4Gby4U/s320/DSC00688.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Returning to the EU, we didn&#8217;t realise so much would change. Slovenia marked the halfway point between the Sea of Marmara and Moreton but it also marked a huge turning point in our trip. <br />Previously, as rare creatures, we&#8217;d been objects of interest to the locals (whole playgrounds of children had rushed to shout &#8216;hello&#8217; as we passed schools in both Turkey and Bosnia), and our bikes were often regarded with awe. Old men (knees out wide, pedalling with heels) and wheelie-pulling kids aside, we&#8217;d seen fewer than 10 cyclists since Istanbul. On meeting these cyclists we&#8217;d greeted each other like long-lost brothers, exchanging maps, currencies and tips on routes. <br />Now we were 2 cyclists among many and we learnt to greet others with at most a nod or a smile. Our fellow &#8216;radlers&#8217;, as we became in Germany, were all wearing lycra from head to toe, riding bikes that were polished, silent and weighed 100g. While we didn&#8217;t quite fit in, making all manner of squeaks, covered in mud and wearing the same shabby clothes we&#8217;d been in for the past 6 weeks, we weren&#8217;t quite the aliens we&#8217;d been before. </p>
<p>People stopped asking us why we didn&#8217;t just buy a car or take the bus.<br />Drivers waited until there was no oncoming traffic before overtaking us.<br />Aeroplanes made all the clouds.<br />Little pictures of bikes began appearing on pavements and signs began pointing us in the direction we should go. <br />Aaahh&#8230;the EU.</p>
<p>And while we were grateful to these little signs for taking us on scenic, traffic-free routes, removing the need for us to think too hard or make our own mistakes, much of the time we spent wishing we were back in Albania.</p>
