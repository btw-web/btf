</a>Trek over, all that remained was to retrieve our bikes from Pokhara, cycle them to Kathmandu, and fly home.Travelling the main Pokhara-Kathmandu highway by bus hadn&#8217;t been much fun. Cycling it looked like our idea of hell. Buses and trucks zooming past at crazy speeds, their fatalistic drivers not overly bothered with paying much attention to the road. If we cycled this way how long would it take for an insignificant pair of cycle tourists to be flattened?</p>
<p>These dangerous odds along with the noise and roadside rubbish made it clear we needed to find a different route. And this proved easy enough to do. A couple of pointers from Sonam at Dawn &#8217;til Dusk, followed by a few hours poring over satellite images on Google Earth and we were all set to go.</p>
<p>Though only a short hop, we were excited at the prospect of getting back in the saddle. Four months had been too long. Any trepidation about how our knees would hold up to the steep climbs faded as we left town and elation swept over us. The thrill of two-wheeled speed, so wonderfully liberating! No traffic, dirt roads, views of towering peaks in the Annapurna, Manaslu, Ganesh and Langtang Himals whenever we turned our heads north. Eating simply and well, sleeping on hard beds, chatting with friendly villagers, all under the watchful eye of the magnificent Himalaya. This was more like it. This is what adventures are made of!</p>
<p>As we freewheeled down into a smoggy Kathmandu Valley Haz&#8217;s camera slipped from her bike, never to be seen again. We didn&#8217;t let this spoil our mood for long. It had been a fabulous end to our Himalayan sojourn.</p>
