<title>Interesting people we meet</title>
<meta name="description" content="Interesting people we meet is what makes this adventure so fun!  Let me introduce you to a few we met over the past few days.  (I changed the names where appropriate.) Darin As we were pedaling out of South Dakota into our third state, North Dakota, we stopped at the entrance sign for photos.  While we were taking a quick selfie, Darin pulled up in his rental car and walked up to take his own selfie with the Welcome to North Dakota sign.  I offered to snap his photo and a friendship was born. Darin shared a little bit about some of the challenges he had experienced in the past and also some of his great pleasures.  He loves to travel, much like we do, but also totally different.  He loves to see new places, and in fact, that is why he had driven the two and a half-hour drive just so he could step a few feet into North Dakota and take a photo.  North Dakota was his 49th state, he only had Arkansas left to complete his list.  He also loves international travel and has already been in 70 countries.  He plans on getting to his goal of 100 countries in the near future. Both Darin and I  love the privilege of seeing and being in new places, that is why we do what we do.  For Darin, it is about seeing as many places as possible.  For us, well, we have a bit slower approach.  Being able to experience different places and meet new people is why we want to travel the way we do. Another really cool thing about Darin, for two consecutive years he was able to watch a baseball game in every major league baseball stadium.  That is thirty different games in thirty stadiums.  He said he would watch an afternoon game in one city and fly to another city to watch an evening game.  He loves baseball and said he didn&#8217;t want to look back with any regrets about missing out.  (I think he has a better travel budget than we do). Sharon We rolled into Ludlow SD looking forward to a cold coke to drink.  There were three buildings in town; the school, the church, and the bar.  The bar looked closed but we pulled our bikes up to a picnic table in the shade. We thought we would open our packs for a snack. That thought was interrupted by Sharon driving up in her car with many small dogs yapping at the windows.  &#8220;The bar is closed but can I get you anything?&#8221;, she asked.  Bruce requested an outdoor spigot to fill our water bottles and Sharon jumped out of the car.  &#8220;No, I will take you inside and get you some&#8221;, she pronounced.  Bruce started to protest, but Sharon stated with authority, &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me &#8216;no&#8217;!  I am the mother around here and you just follow me!&#8221;  There was no arguing this.  We followed Sharon around to the back door of the bar and she began to tell us her own history and the history of Ludlow, which are basically one and the same. We made our way past last years Christmas decorations and piles of fake table bouquets to the wooden bar.  She filled our water bottles with ice while she told us about how she became tired of working for others and decided she wanted to buy her own bar and with that, a town.  &#8220;So Ludlow is my town!&#8221; she states.  We had no doubt!  Sharon wanted us to sign the top of the wooden bar before we left.  We felt so taken care of and mothered!   We had been given a window into the life of an exceptional woman!  She sent us on our way with a wave and a yap of many lapdogs. Laurie It had started to rain hard as we pulled up to Belfield ND.  An arrow pointed to the downtown district and we headed there hoping to find a coffee shop.  We leaned our bikes against a small building called, The Cup and Cake. These being two of my favorite things, I was excited.  While drinking a White Chocolate Mocha, we struck up a conversation with the gal behind the counter, named Laurie. Laurie just bought this business and was also baking and decorating cakes for graduation and birthday parties.  We asked about good camping sites for our tent.  After making some calls and finding that they were all open to camp but the bathrooms are locked, Laurie offered her yard for us to camp in. Our evening turned into unexpected pleasure.  Laurie and Nate invited us to eat some grilled burgers with them in the shade trees of their yard.  We brought our can of Pringles and some Brownie Crisp novelty we picked up at the last convenience store.  Laurie had fresh baked Dilly Bread, fried beets and onions, grilled asparagus, and green salad.  Vegetables are a challenge for us to get in our diet and we so enjoyed the food and company. Nate had recently bought his own business and it was fun to hear their aspiring dreams and challenges.  Their son Michael enjoyed using our drone and sending it up over their property. Bruce and I felt so privileged to be let into these interesting people&#8217;s lives.  We were complete strangers who quickly became friends."/>
