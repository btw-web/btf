<meta name="description" content="Reality -vs- Expectations When you have dreamed about doing something for over twenty years it is a bit scary to wonder if your dream will resemble reality at all.  So let me give you the &#8220;Low-Down&#8221; on how my reality aligns with expectations. Cycling The truth is cycling is often a mental game.  There are days that biking for 75 miles seems pretty comfortable. There are also other days that 35 miles are really tough going.  Obviously environmental factors such as hills (sometimes mountains), wind, temperature, and humidity can all influence. But oftentimes it feels like it is predominately about my attitude.  Knowing that we have a good place to stay or meal to eat at the end of the day makes the ride easier.  At this point, I have to admit that I love knowing that we can get up in the morning and just ride. Often times the rhythm of pedaling is soothing to my soul.  (addition by Sonja:  Bruce takes off on his bike each time he gets on and &#8220;Bless the Lord, Oh my soul, oh my soul&#8230;.&#8221; burst forth spontaneously.  It always makes me smile!) Sleeping So, the truth is before we left on our trip I woke up in the middle of the night wondering how was I ever going to be able to sleep for 16 months in a tent.  I seriously lost sleep before we left, wondering if I could do it.  Let me assure you that was lost sleep over nothing. In the past 37 nights, we have slept in our tent 31 nights, and I can honestly say I slept soundly every single night. Confession, I never once woke up wondering if I would be able to sleep all night in a bed again. &nbsp; Eating Well, here is the reality that is a bit different than our expectations.  I really thought we might eat out a bit more than we do, but the combination of COVID, location, and budget has left us depending mostly on the meals we can put together from supplies that take no refrigeration.  The reality is that we are often so hungry that everything we make tastes amazing. We often laugh and say I don&#8217;t think I would ever make, let alone eat this if I was home.   We have found that eating several small meals (things like cheese and crackers, apples, jerky, and PB and J on tortillas) works best throughout the day and we try to eat a hot meal in the evening. Time I truly expected that the days would go slow and that things might drag while we were on the road.  But the reality is that the days fly by.  It is really hard to believe that we have been at this over a month (and over 1800 miles) and it feels like we have only just started.  Even on our non-riding days, the day seems to go by too quickly. 24-7 Here is a tough one for some couples, what is the reality of 24-7 with your spouse?  I realize that Sonja and I have been blessed with a special marriage and relationship, but I know that I could not do this type of trip by myself or with anyone else. Certainly, we have had a few moments where we didn&#8217;t agree, but we have always resolved differences quickly.  And of course, I realized that she was right after all. Wrap-Up So is everything perfect? No, not quite.  But I can unequivocally say that the reality of our trip at this point has met or surpassed our expectations.  I am so thankful for this opportunity and can&#8217;t wait to see what the rest of the journey holds."/>

<p>When you have dreamed about doing something for over twenty years it is a bit scary to wonder if <a href="https://theroadlesscycled.com/the-ragged-couch-pillow/">your dream</a> will resemble reality at all.  So let me give you the &#8220;Low-Down&#8221; on how my reality aligns with expectations.</p>

<p>Confession, I never once woke up wondering if I would be able to sleep all night in a bed again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Eating</h3>
<p>Well, here is the reality that is a bit different than our expectations.  I really thought we might eat out a bit more than we do, but the combination of COVID, location, and budget has left us depending mostly on the meals we can put together from supplies that take no refrigeration.  The reality is that we are often so hungry that everything we make tastes amazing. We often laugh and say I don&#8217;t think I would ever make, let alone eat this if I was home.   We have found that eating several small meals (things like cheese and crackers, apples, jerky, and PB and J on tortillas) works best throughout the day and we try to eat a hot meal in the evening.</p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>I truly expected that the days would go slow and that things might drag while we were on the road.  But the reality is that the days fly by.  It is really hard to believe that we have been at this over a month (and over 1800 miles) and it feels like we have only just started.  Even on our non-riding days, the day seems to go by too quickly.</p>
<h3>24-7</h3>
<p>Here is a tough one for some couples, what is the reality of 24-7 with your spouse?  I realize that Sonja and I have been blessed with a special marriage and relationship, but I know that I could not do this type of trip by myself or with anyone else. <img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-403 alignright" src="https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1687-scaled-e1593726153802-300x300.jpg" alt="Bruce and Sonja sitting on a log" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1687-scaled-e1593726153802-300x300.jpg 300w, https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1687-scaled-e1593726153802-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1687-scaled-e1593726153802-150x150.jpg 150w, https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1687-scaled-e1593726153802-768x768.jpg 768w, https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1687-scaled-e1593726153802-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1687-scaled-e1593726153802-1140x1140.jpg 1140w, https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1687-scaled-e1593726153802-75x75.jpg 75w, https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1687-scaled-e1593726153802.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Certainly, we have had a few moments where we didn&#8217;t agree, but we have always resolved differences quickly.  And of course, I realized that she was right after all.</p>
