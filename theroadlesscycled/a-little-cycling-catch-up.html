<title>A little catch-up!</title>
<meta name="description" content="It is time for a little catch-up on technology.  We have been gloriously out-of-service for the past few days on the roads less cycled!  No internet and no juice to charge our phones or computer.  The back roads of Wisconsin have been all that we hoped!  I will give you some random snatches of our last week cycling on the road. First sighting of Lake Superior Coming down from Ely MN to the shoreline was awe-inspiring. We were the only ones at the overlook in the morning sun as we saw the lake for our first glimpse.  The rocky shore, blue water, and brilliant sky made it hard to leave the overlook.  As we cycled south the vistas kept peaking out between trees and we would ooh and ahh as we biked.  We stopped many times and ate our lunch on a bench overlooking the water. I kept trying to take pictures to show you all how beautiful it is, obviously, they never lived up to the view.  I finally gave up, put my phone down, and just soaked up the scenery. Lots of cycling conversations If you know Bruce, you know that two of his loves are coffee and bikes.  We stayed two nights with a warmshowers.org host named Dan who owns his own shop.  It is a combination of a bike shop and a coffee house called The Spokengear Cyclery &amp; Outdoor.  We pitched our tent out in the back and had warm showers, laundry facilities, and forest dining in style. In Duluth, we stayed with Lois and Terry who fed us mountains of spaghetti and garlic bread. We all have a love of cycling and swapped stories through the evening of adventures and dreams.  Terry road with us the next morning on the Willard Munger Trail that helped us skirt much of the city and left us after traveling over the Bong Bridge that dropped us in Wisconson. &nbsp; The Apostle Islands When I first started mapping out our route over a year ago, the Apostle Islands were a fantastical dream that might never be obtained.  I looked at pictures of them with their rocky shores and tall pines and wondered if I would ever set foot on them.  It happened!  Kayaks were rented, and we spent a leisurely day in the sun paddling and exploring.  We took the ferry to Madeline Island and camped.  We sat on the rocky shore and marveled at the incredibly clear cold water.  Interesting people were everywhere and we had fun conversations. &nbsp;"/>

<h1>A little catch-up!</h1>
<p>It is time for a little catch-up on technology.  We have been gloriously out-of-service for the past few days on the roads less cycled!  No internet and no juice to charge our phones or computer.  The back roads of Wisconsin have been all that we hoped!  I will give you some random snatches of our last week cycling on the road.</p>
<h3>First sighting of Lake Superior</h3>

<p>I kept trying to take pictures to show you all how beautiful it is, obviously, they never lived up to the view.  I finally gave up, put my phone down, and just soaked up the scenery.</p>
<h3>Lots of cycling conversations</h3>
<p>If you know Bruce, you know that two of his loves are coffee and bikes.  We stayed two nights with a warmshowers.org host named Dan who owns his own shop.  It is a combination of a bike shop and a coffee house called <a href="http://Spokengear.com">The Spokengear Cyclery &amp; Outdoor</a>.  We pitched our tent out in the back and had warm showers, laundry facilities, and forest dining in style.</p>
<p>In Duluth, we stayed with Lois and Terry who fed us mountains of spaghetti and garlic bread.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-394 size-medium" title="Three cyclist on Munger Trail" src="https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1623-300x225.jpg" alt="three cyclist on the Munger trail" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1623-300x225.jpg 300w, https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1623-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1623-768x576.jpg 768w, https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1623-1536x1152.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>We all have a love of cycling and swapped stories through the evening of adventures and dreams.  Terry road with us the next morning on the <a href="http://munger-trail.com">Willard Munger Trail</a> that helped us skirt much of the city and left us after traveling over the Bong Bridge that dropped us in Wisconson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Apostle Islands</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-396 size-medium" title="two kayakers on Lake Superior" src="https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1718-225x300.jpg" alt="Kayaking the Apostle Islands" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1718-225x300.jpg 225w, https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1718-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1718-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p>When I first started <a href="https://theroadlesscycled.com/just-another-step/">mapping out our route over a year ago</a>, the Apostle Islands were a fantastical dream that might never be obtained.  I looked at pictures of them with their rocky shores and tall pines and wondered if I would ever set foot on them.  It happened!  Kayaks were rented, and we spent a leisurely day in the sun paddling and exploring.  We took the ferry to Madeline Island and camped.  We sat on the rocky shore and marveled at the incredibly clear cold water.  Interesting people were everywhere and we had fun conversations.</p>
