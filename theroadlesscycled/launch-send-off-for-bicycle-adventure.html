<title>Launch Send-off for Bicycle Adventure!</title>
<meta name="description" content="The Launch! Our launch send-off pictures for our bicycle adventure were taken by CJ Baker.   This is out of order but I wanted to show you the early morning celebration that took place May 26th! It was early on Tuesday morning, but friends showed up to encourage us on our way.  Goodbyes had all been said to parents and family.  Belongings were in the storage unit.  All that was left was checking tire pressure and loading the bikes. It was wonderful to have friends gather to commit our cycling adventure to the Lord, for safety and health, and for joy in the journey! And we were off! Bruce and I could not stop smiling.  It felt unreal to finally doing what we had talked about for so long. Launching on this adventure had been all talk for 20 years of our marriage.  Putting the feet into the pedals was a finality that put all our trepidations and concerns behind us.  We were doing this!  There was no turning back! Bruce and I whooped and yelled ourselves silly after we were safely out of earshot.  All the pent up anxiety came rushing out in glad, hilarious jibberish.  For the next few hours, days and weeks, we would continue to look at each other and say, &#8220;can you believe we are really doing this?&#8221; Happily, YES, we are doing it and loving it! &nbsp;"/>
