<title>Memories in Massachusetts</title>
<meta name="description" content="Ipswich Time seems to roll under our bicycle tires rapidly on our perimeter ride around the United States.  We entered Massachusetts as the temperatures begin to cool, and bushes and scattered leaves turn gold.  The scenery of the woodlands and the coastlines were phenomenal.   We cycled through historic towns with homes built in the 1700s.  The homes are large, square, two-story affairs with flat fronts. They don’t have porches and the door drops one right out on the sidewalk.  We stopped to check out some gravestones in a settler’s cemetery that was founded in 1635.  It was sobering to read the dates and the short lifespans of so many of those who came to settle our country.  The mosquitoes chased us out of the cemetery before we could take any pictures! Gloucester We biked into Gloucester MA and were quickly captivated by the rich fishing history and the friendly people we met along the street.  We met a proud Gloucester citizen named Manuel who had spent his entire life in the picturesque fishing village.  He told us much of the city’s history, recommended some restaurants, and even helped us pronounce the name of his town correctly.  The c is actually silent and the -er pronounced -uh.  So Gloucester is actually pronounced Glost-uh, and in case you didn’t know, “lobster” to many New England locals, is pronounced “lobst-uh”.  We worked on our phonetics. &nbsp; As we pedaled around Gloucester, we were reminded of just how dangerous the fishermen’s life really is.  There are several statues along the shore paying tribute to fishermen and their families. A memorial facing the Gloucester Harbor lists over 5,000 names of the fisherman who have been lost at sea.  It stands soberly reminding us of the bravery of those who go out on the unforgiving ocean.  Many of you may remember the movie “The Perfect Storm” which was based on the true story of a fishing boat from Gloucester in which six men lost their lives (hope I didn’t ruin the movie for you).  We walked out on the breakwater in the Gloucester Harbor, past the scenic Eastern Point Lighthouse. Boston We were able to spend a day in Boston just being a tourist.  Certainly, COVID impacted some of this experience as there were not milling crowds. We were reminded of the history of our great country as we followed some of the Freedom Trail, and some of the effort and sacrifices made for our country.  Paul Revere’s House and the Old North Church are buried beneath the modern skyscrapers and look lonely and lost. Cape Cod When we left Boston, we put our bikes on a ferry that took us across Cape Cod Bay.  This was a 35-mile journey to the tip of Cape Cod, Provincetown, MA.  Provincetown did not hold any appeal to Sonja and me, so we purchased some groceries and pedaled out of town toward our campsite.  I was a bit surprised in the foliage on Cape Cod. I expected to see a lot of sand, but I was intrigued by the scrub oaks and pines that made up the primary portion of trees.  They are short and twisted as if the wind of the Atlantic plays havoc with them. &nbsp; After setting up our camp, we rode our bikes to the beach and ate our supper overlooking the ocean.  We enjoyed watching the waves roll in and even were able to look on as a pair of seals played near the shore. We were surprised at how big they are.  Sharks, we are told, follow the seals and they have been spotted off the Cape, but we did not see any black fins. Cape Cod National Seashore We listened for rain during the night.  It was in the forecast, but only a few sprinkles materialized.  In the morning we packed up our bikes and made our way to a paved “rails to trails” path that meandered among the oaks for 23 miles. The walking/bike path is just used for recreation and has been converted from an old railroad track.  It was outstanding cycling as we enjoyed the traffic-free, nearly level ride. &nbsp; After we left this path, we biked some back roads that crest along the coast.  We enjoyed multiple scenic vistas of a gray, churning, and angry ocean. We ended the day by camping in the yard of a Warm Showers host near a little inland lake.  The wind continued to blow, and the tops of the trees moaned.  It made sleeping a bit more difficult, but we were very thankful for our tent and the protection it provides. &nbsp; Our last day in Massachusetts dawned with beautiful clear skies.  With our bikes packed, we headed west to a new state, new sights, and new people to meet. &nbsp;"/>
