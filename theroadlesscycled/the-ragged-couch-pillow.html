<meta name="description" content="The couch pillow laughs at me. It has mocked my dreams for months, even years. The “bike trip” dream is constantly there and yet keeps being put on the back shelf as life keeps us busy. The time has now come, we tell each other, “it is now or never!” If we don’t go this year, we will be too old to physically handle it. And so I talk to my pillow as I pass by. We are going! It is going to happen! Adventure awaits no more! Do I have what it takes? Paging through the road atlas from one state to another looking at possible routes, I am hit with both incredible excitement and a little bit of gut fear. I wonder if I really have what it takes to go on the road with a bicycle this far. Maybe I am not up for the adventure! Just one or 2 inches on the map is a whole day’s ride. That ride might have hills, rain, headwind, grumpy attitudes, sore muscles, and the list goes on. In my excited mode, it is always sunny, the wind is always behind me, and I am thrilled about the day and the miles ahead. I know this will not always be so. Can I do the days of wind and loneliness, peanut butter and tortillas again, up long hills with a sore butt? What happens when I get the urge to bake cookies, decorate my house for the fall season or mow the lawn. I laugh back! I question myself and yet I am still excited. And I know I have no idea what I’m getting into but that is what spurs me on. It’s the unknown and the road ahead. And the people I will meet and the shared experiences. It’s the joy of knowing my own two legs have gotten me this far on the journey. It is the sitting down at night after a hard days ride and feeling accomplished. However, this I am looking forward to and so much more. I So as the pillow sits on my couch, I smile at it….we are doing it! The dream is becoming a reality. Adventure awaits!"/>
