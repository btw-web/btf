<title>Oysters and Tesla&#8217;s</title>
<meta name="description" content="We constantly talk about the people we meet.  They truly are what makes this trip so much fun.  Let me introduce you to our new friends, Lee Ann and Dave.  They are oyster farmers at the Nandua Oyster Company, LLC. on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.  (This peninsula extends down from Maryland like a long finger and points across the Chesapeake Bay to Virginia Beach.) We stayed with Lee Ann and Dave in their beautiful home on the bay.  Another cycle tourist also stayed that night, and so it was a fun group.  Bruce and I learned everything we could about Oysters.  From growing them to harvesting them, it was a very interesting process. The Oyster seed The seed oysters are ordered from a supplier and are produced to have a triploid chromosome, which means they are not able to reproduce.  These oysters then grow more rapidly and will not survive for more than four years, as to not contaminate natural fisheries. (This is Bruce talking&#8230;) When the oyster seed comes they purchase two million at a time and they come in a gallon-sized plastic bag.  From the bags, the seed is placed in small containers (five-gallon buckets) with seawater being pumped through them.  As the oysters grow they then are transferred to &#8220;upwellers&#8221; which are floating nursery tanks that pump seawater through the growing oysters until they are large enough to be placed in wire cages with 1/2 inch wire mesh.  These cages are then dropped into the bottom of the bay. Every morning the crews pull a selected set of cages from the bay and pull the marketable oysters from they cages and return the other back to the bay after cleaning to be harvested at a later date. Keeping them pretty! (Back to Sonja). Something that I found very interesting is that oysters have to be handled frequently by the crew.  Each month cages are pulled up and sized and cleaned.  If they are not handled, they grow into funny shapes.  To be desirable for the market they need to be cup-shaped without any knobs on them.  We watched the crew sorting the hard shells and knocking off lumps with a hammer. Bruce talked and joked with the young men that were sorting.  Dressed in their full waterproof gear, they looked like they were having fun. Harvesting Oysters They have two boats that go out and harvest the oysters.  It has a large crane on it to bring in the wire baskets.  Every morning the crews pull a selected set of cages from the bay and sort the marketable oysters from they cages and return the other oysters back to the bay after cleaning to be harvested at a later date. Cooking them Oysters can be fried, steamed, poached, and broiled.  The way they were served to us was roasted over the fire! Dave had built a fire in the yard firepit, and he and Bruce went over and hauled a big plastic tub of fresh oysters over.  Dave laid them on the grill over the coals.  He said they are done when you can see some bubbling coming out of the two halved of the shell.  With tongs, he put them on our plates. Eating Oysters This was the best part of our learning experience. Bruce put on a wire mesh glove and took up a sharp prying tool.  I manned the camera and Bruce did all the oyster shucking for me.  Bruce pried them open and then worked the tool around to cut the muscle that holds them in.  The trick is to do this all without spilling the delicious juice they are soaking in. Once I got the oyster from Bruce, I tipped it all into my mouth at once, juice and oyster.  They have a wonderful salty broth taste that is sweet as well. I was nervous that I would not like them. The texture was my greatest fear, but I was so pleasantly surprised.  We ate plates of them, throwing the shells in a heap by the fire. The final touch! The wonderful evening ended by us all getting into Dave’s Tesla for a ride to watch NASA Antares rocket launch at Wallops Island.  The launch was to send up a $23m toilet to the International Space Station. The Tesla seemed to be the perfect vehicle to ride to a launch in as it was so next-generation itself.  Dave let the car drive itself, and I sat in the back holding my breath.  It had so many bells and whistles, it makes my computer look silly. (Bruce interjection)   I had never even ridden in a Tesla X, so getting to ride in the biggest and likely most expensive version was a blast.  The self-driving feature is intriguing but the acceleration is more impressive to me.  The pure power without slippage amazing.  When you step on the accelerator it pushes you back in the seat with such force that it requires considerable effort to lean forward. (Back to Sonja) On the way home (the rocket launch was aborted at the 2-minute countdown), Bruce drove the Tesla.  He was so excited, and I was incredibly nervous.  I was very glad when it was safely back in the garage without any scratches on it.  It costs more than our retirement fund!! Thank you, Dave and Lee Ann for the wonderful evening, so full of new experiences! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"/>
