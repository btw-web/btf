<title>The Wins and Whines of our Tour</title>
<meta name="description" content="Wins and Whines Several people have asked about the equipment that we have used on our bicycle tour around the United States, what we really like, and what we wouldn’t take again. We call it the wins and whines of our trip.   As we tour, we are continually evaluating if our equipment is worth its weight.  So, I thought I would take a few minutes to tell you some things we consider winners, and then some other items that we have been packing that we are not so pleased with. &nbsp; Wins &nbsp; Let me start with some of the equipment we really value for its utility and function related to its weight in the panniers. Helinox Chair Zero Our first winner is the Helinox Chair Zero.  We love these chairs for their comfort and benefit. Even though they weigh a full pound, after touring all day, having the opportunity to sit down in a chair with a backrest is amazing.  They are quick to set up and so are useful on the shoulder of the highway or on the beach.  We often find ourselves stopping for lunch or a snack when no tables or benches are available.  These chairs provide us with an alternative to sitting in the rocks or the grass.  If you are considering a pack or bike trip, make sure to check out these chairs. Vumos sleeping bag liner The Vumos (silk-like) sleeping bag liner is our next winner.  This liner weighs 11 ounces and rolls up into a 2.5” by 7” stuff sack.  On this bike trip, it has been common to have temperatures in the upper seventies and lower eighties at night.  We needed something lightweight and comfortable to sleep in besides our mummy sleeping bags.  These liners were the ticket, affordable, washable, comfortable, and cool.  A real winner when it is time to sleep. Collapsible pour-over coffee maker One of my personal favorite pieces of equipment is the GSI collapsible pour-over coffee maker. Every morning I heat water on our little stove.  Sonja uses part of the water to make tea and I use the rest to make delicious coffee.  This pour-over weighs less than 5 ounces and collapses to about a half-inch thick and five and a half inches in circumference.  The only drawback is the need for filters, but they are light and cheap.  Every day started with good strong black coffee, is a good day! &nbsp; Whines &nbsp; As we have toured, we have learned some things that we would have liked to know or at least understand more completely before we left home.  Consequently, some of the things we whine about are not necessarily flaws with the product, but our own preference. MSR Whisperlite Univeral Stove The first piece of equipment I would reconsider is our MSR Whisperlite Universal stove.  I originally purchased this stove because we had hoped to cycle internationally.  This stove gives one the flexibility to buy small amounts of fuel as we toured, including automobile gas.   At this point, we have only burned white gas, yet we have still repeatedly needed to clean the fuel jet.  Other complaints I have about this stove is the fact that it offers poor flame control, which means simmering and pan cooking options are very limited.  I also find that the priming flame that is required for these stove flames very high and seems risky for use in dry environments. Finally, the fuel consumption seems rather high with this stove.  Part of this is likely related to the priming process (allowing raw fuel to run into the priming dish) and to the fact that every time you take the stove apart to put away, raw fuel leaks from the tube between the fuel canister and the stove.  I will say, however, it does boil water quickly. Google Maps My next whine is Google Maps, and this has been an interesting one. I have to say that Google Maps has worked great in more urban areas and has been a true asset to help us navigate through large cities.  However, in the less cycled and more rural areas, the cycling function of Google Maps has led us astray multiple times.  We have been routed astray: to private roads that are gated, roads that are closed to all traffic, roads that are not cyclable, and to roads that simply do not exist.  Even with these complaints (whines), I have to say I am very thankful for Google Maps, and I have learned just to check routes more carefully before we commit. COVID-19 My final whine is not about a tool or equipment, but a virus, yeah, its COVID-19.  We have been faced with multiple challenges because of this pandemic.  I do realize that I have no room to whine because everyone has been dealing with this. But some of the challenges blamed on COVID, do feel whine-worthy.  Here are a few examples:  stores and restaurants refusing to put out garbage cans for customers and telling us it’s because of COVID (REALLY?), every public restroom in a town being closed (you guessed it, because of COVID), campgrounds being open to RV’s but closed to tents (yep, because of COVID).  Well, you get the idea. I would be amiss to not mention a few benefits brought about by the virus, such as no crowds at tourist sites such as Niagara Falls, decreased traffic in cities such as Toledo, Cleveland, and even Boston, and finally, the excuse to wear a mask anytime I want. &nbsp; I will never be able to fully express how thankful I am to be able to take this journey.  What an amazing opportunity to see such beautiful places and meet so many great people.  I am truly awestruck by the WIN this entire adventure is!"/>

<h1>The Wins and Whines of our Tour</h1>
<h2>Wins and Whines</h2>
<p>Several people have asked about the equipment that we have used on our <a href="https://theroadlesscycled.com/bicycle-touring-let-the-adventure-begin/">bicycle tour around the United States</a>, what we really like, and what we wouldn’t take again.

<p>Every morning I heat water on our little stove.  Sonja uses part of the water to make tea and I use the rest to make delicious coffee.  This pour-over weighs less than 5 ounces and collapses to about a half-inch thick and five and a half inches in circumference.  The only drawback is the need for filters, but they are light and cheap.  Every day started with good strong black coffee, is a good day!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Whines</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we have toured, we have learned some things that we would have liked to know or at least understand more completely before we left home.  Consequently, some of the things we whine about are not necessarily flaws with the product, but our own preference.</p>

<h3>Google Maps</h3>
<p>My next whine is Google Maps, and this has been an interesting one.</p>
<figure id="attachment_447" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-447" style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-447 size-medium" src="https://theroadlesscycled.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/61602738397__AFB3BA53-12E1-439C-AA21-425822DA65BB-2-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-447" class="wp-caption-text">Route discussions</figcaption></figure>
<p>I have to say that Google Maps has worked great in more urban areas and has been a true asset to help us navigate through large cities.  However, in the less cycled and more rural areas, the cycling function of Google Maps has led us astray multiple times.  We have been routed astray: to private roads that are gated, roads that are closed to all traffic, roads that are not cyclable, and to roads that simply do not exist.  Even with these complaints (whines), I have to say I am very thankful for Google Maps, and I have learned just to check routes more carefully before we commit.</p>
<h3>COVID-19</h3>
<p>My final whine is not about a tool or equipment, but a virus, yeah, its COVID-19.  We have been faced with multiple challenges because of this pandemic.  I do realize that I have no room to whine because everyone has been dealing with this. But some of the challenges blamed on COVID, do feel whine-worthy.  Here are a few examples:  stores and restaurants refusing to put out garbage cans for customers and telling us it’s because of COVID (REALLY?), every public restroom in a town being closed (you guessed it, because of COVID), campgrounds being open to RV’s but closed to tents (yep, because of COVID).  Well, you get the idea.</p>
<p>I would be amiss to not mention a few benefits brought about by the virus, such as no crowds at tourist sites such as Niagara Falls, decreased traffic in cities such as Toledo, Cleveland, and even Boston, and finally, the excuse to wear a mask anytime I want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will never be able to fully express how thankful I am to be able to take this journey.  What an amazing opportunity to see such beautiful places and meet so many great people.  I am truly awestruck by the WIN this entire adventure is!</p>
