<title>A Typical Day</title>
<meta name="description" content="A Typical Day What do you eat on the road each day? Are you eating in restaurants and sleeping in motels?  Where do you take showers? How do you get laundry done? How many miles do you do? What does a typical day of cycling look like? We have had many of these questions and I thought I would try to answer some of them.  We are still in the learning process on the food but have found some favorites as well.  We try to have about two days worth of food in our panniers.  We do a lot of small meals and snack often.  A typical day for us might look like this: Mornings We wake up in our tent early as we go to bed tired and early! I start packing up air mattresses, sleeping bags, and our silk sheets.  The silk sheets have been such a perfect addition as the nights are warm and as it is just a light sleeve with a zipper to close it, we leave our sleeping bags unzipped and use them only to cover if needed  It also doesn&#8217;t restrict your legs as mummy bags are apt to do! While I do this, Bruce lights the MSR Whisper Lite stove and makes tea and coffee.  We unfold our camping chairs if we are camping without a picnic table and we have a leisurely breakfast of a granola bar.  We have found that that is all we need to start with as we snack often. Noon We usually put in around 20 miles and stop for a snack which is often around 9 or 10 am.  Sometimes we sit right on the asphalt if the traffic is scarce, otherwise, we pull out our nifty chairs and relax.  Sometimes it is just jerky, or a banana/apple.  Other times will pull out everything and have our standard peanut butter and jelly on a tortilla.  We also will do crackers and cheese and have found that craisins on top of this are amazing!  Cheese travels well for about three days even though it does get soft. We also have discovered tuna packets that have different flavors.  We load crackers with this and love the variation. Almonds, trail mix, dried cherries or fruit of some sort, break up the monotony. We crave salty things and find that Pringles and salty peanuts are amazing.  I never let us put Pringles in our shopping cart in my previous life as they are dangerously good, but we devour them without guilt now which is a wonderful feeling.  We seem to end every snack with some sort of chocolate, peanut butter M&amp;M&#8217;s travel well. We might eat again at noon or late afternoon. It just varies with how hard we had to pedal that day. &nbsp; Supper We are gradually expanding our menus for supper.  Our favorite supper so far is a small can of chicken cooked with taco seasoning and rolled in a tortilla. We also love bacon and eggs for supper!  We carry a small Nalgene water bottle that we crack 10 eggs into (that is all it will hold) and buy a pound of bacon.  We eat half of it for supper and cook the rest of it in the morning for breakfast.  Our cheese that has gotten too soft tastes wonderful in the eggs too. Packets of dried noodles with chicken added has tasted good.  Our biggest challenge is getting vegetables in our diet.  We carried fresh broccoli and ate those two nights in a row, but the vegetables are heavy.  Carrot sticks eaten fresh are easy as well.  This is a work in progress and would love any input you all have. Evenings We have slept in a hotel twice in the 24 nights we have been on the road.  We are very comfortable in our tent and sleep hard after a day of exercise.  We do love showers and often have to work hard to find them but a shower after a hot day of riding it the best thing ever!  Truck stops, some campsites have had a shower for us. Sometimes we take a walk after supper and try to remind our leg muscles of what walking is like.  Other nights we are lazy and sit in our chairs and drink coffee/tea and eat chocolate.  No matter what we do, it seems like we are in bed before the sun goes down. &nbsp; Milage/ Laundry The daily mileage on the bike has so many variables.  We have gone as low as 24 miles the day we tackled the Big Horn Mountains and crawled at 3 mph forever!  Fifty to 60 miles is comfortable and gives us a lazy afternoon to sightsee.  Lately, we have been doing 70 miles a day as I think we are getting stronger.  Our longest day was 88 miles but also had some good tailwind included. Laundry has worked well so far as we have clothes for about three days and then we find a laundry mat or do laundry at the home we are staying at.  We have stayed with friends (which include the new friends we have made) about 4 nights and they have been wonderful to let us throw in a load of clothes.  That is what most days look like.  We feel spoiled to take pinics everyday and camping trips every night. Life is a wonderful adventure! &nbsp;"/>
