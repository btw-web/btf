<title>The Bike panniers are packed!</title>
<meta name="description" content="We have gone back and forth over every little item in our bike panniers asking ourselves, &#8220;do we need it?&#8221;  &#8220;Is it worth the extra weight?&#8221;  We have laid all the gear out and packed it again trying to compress what we think we will need. I am sure we will be getting rid of some gear as we pedal up steep hills and wonder why we didn&#8217;t think to pack other necessities, but we have to start somewhere! Bruce and I have the next 18 months ahead to explore the country by bicycle.  We have saved our pennies and dreamed and schemed!  Our bike route will be the perimeter of the USA starting in Wyoming and headed east.  We hope to be in Maine by fall and Florida by winter! The start date is 6 days away! Bruce and I are leaving from Powell Wyoming on the 26th of May and heading up over the Big Horn Mountains.  The state of Montana has closed its borders to tourists due to the COVID crisis, so we are going with plan B. We will head over to Devils Tower in Wyoming and then ride north to get to the perimeter of the USA.  Being flexible is part of the whole idea of the trip so there is nothing like getting to change plans right away.  It also means we get to start by going up the steepest mountain pass around. Alternate U.S. Highway 14 is a winding, steep road with a 10-percent grade that climbs up to 9,430 feet above sea level. Once we reach the top of the Big Horns, there will be wide-open, green meadows.  The creeks will be gushing with snow runoff and surrounded by rocky peaks and drifts of snow. All of this makes me scared and excited at the same time.  The bike panniers do feel heavy.  The steep road seems daunting.  If I can make it up this climb, then I can take on the world.  One slow pedal at a time!"/>
