<title>Highlights of Michigan</title>
<meta name="description" content="Mackinac Island Michigan has been left behind but as I pour over pictures, I realize I have not posted about some of the highlights.  We cycled from the western tip of the Upper Peninsula to the east side and then down to Mackinac Island.  Plans of going over the Mackinac Bridge were changed as we learned that bikes are not allowed to be ridden due to the wind.  Bicycles are usually transported over the bridge by a shuttle that you pay for, but as with many things&#8230;COVID has changed that this year.  The only way for a bike to cross was to take the ferry to the Island and then ferry again to the mainland. We took the day to explore Mackinac Island while we were there.  There is so much history on the Island as there was a battle there during the War of 1812 between the British and American troops. Signboards tell the history of the island and we wandered the town learning the story,   We hiked some of the trails and enjoyed the rocky views.  Loaded bikes with panniers on them were not the norm and we got lots of funny looks, but we are used to that now.  We also enjoyed the fudge even though it blew the daily budget! Tunnel of Trees We had received lots of great advice about placed to see in Michigan, and so we traveled down the western shore of Lake Michigan.  The Tunnel of Trees was the first destination on our list.   For 30 miles, big Maple trees tower overhead and make a canopy over the road.  The sun filters through the branches and casts beautiful shadows on the fern forest floor. The road is 35 mph only and so cars only use it if they are out enjoying the trees as well. Wineries We stayed in Traverse City and did a day trip up on Old Mission Peninsula to see the vineyards. The packs came off the bikes and made a slow day of meandering along the shore and enjoying the many orchards and vineyards.   A highlight for Bruce was an impromptu conversation with the owner which quickly delved into the agriculture of how to best grow grapes.  The wine was a treat too! Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes The sand dunes were huge and crowded with people.  It is important to be able to say one has climbed the sand dunes, so we, and about a hundred other people, climbed up the deep silty sand that stretches for miles along Lake Michigan.  A view of the lake was what we thought would be seen from the top, but all we saw was another higher dune and more sand.  It was still fun and the area around that part of Michigan is truly a treat, many lakes, winding roads and bike trails. Harbor towns This was one of the highlights for me.  I love the marinas with boats of all sizes and shapes lined up.  Families loading and bustling around, maintenance, and scrubbing taking place.  The yachts and sailboats speak of a world I know nothing about but promise adventure. The towns themselves seem so neat and tidy.  Everything has the nautical theme and colors and shades of blue dominate. Michigan Lake beaches We had unseasonably hot days while cycling.   Sweat would drip off of our elbows and down our backs.   Dirt and grim would cling to us.  And so the beach would beckon us!  We looked for any accessible beach and dipped in clothes and all.  The water was clear and not as cold as Lake Superior. We joined the throng of people out in the waves and enjoyed cooling off. Thank you Michigan for thrilling us and delighting us in so many ways! &nbsp; &nbsp;"/>
