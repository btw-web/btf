<title>The Dreaded Hill!</title>
<meta name="description" content="The dread! If I dread every hill I see before me, I would dread half my cycling adventure.  I came to this realization after bemoaning the fact that after cresting a monster of a hill, I could see another hill looming up ahead.  They keep coming! 1st line of defense I had to come up with another approach to the dreaded hill!  I have a list of mantras’ I cajole myself with now when I see a hill ahead.  The first thing I tell myself is, “It will lay down!”  They always look the most menacing at a distance and as we get closer, the hill seems to lose its threat and take on a peaceful challenge. 2nd line of defense If the hill is not cooperating and “laying down”, then I go to my second line of defense.  This involves working on my perspective.  I repeat phrases to myself as I laboriously pedal, “I chose this….this is what I do….some people go to work and I pedal up hills…. 3rd line of defense The third line of defense against the hills is my experience the second day out on this adventure.  We did not train for this cycling trip. On day two of our journey, we took on the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming.  It was 13 miles of 10% grade going up the hill with 80 lbs. of gear/bike to get to the top.  We ascended like snails to the top and it took forever.  We stood at the top and looked over the valley and celebrated.  Every hill since that time has been “just a slope” in comparison. “It’s just a slope”, Bruce will yell over his shoulder. The approach Bruce and I tackle hills totally differently.  Bruce has always fallen back on his brute, brawny strength for everything he tackles.  The hills are no different.  If he is falling short before cresting the top, he will stand up on his bike and throw his weight into it. &nbsp; I, on the other hand, love all 27 gears on my bike.  I am learning the art of balancing muscle pressure, speed and pedaling rhythm (cadence).  On the downhill slope, I try to gather all the speed I can get and then see how l can maximize it as I go up the next hill.  I love the feeling of efficiency and the thought of losing momentum without any gain is horrifying. I never take a low gear in anticipation of the need, rather, I wait until my legs tell me it is time. Then I gear down just enough to keep the cadence and pressure comfortable. The victory! This may all seem tedious and uninteresting….but when half your cycling hours are involved in ascending hills, it is gloriously fulfilling.  I love the feeling of reward when the slope gives up its challenge and the view over the top opens up to new vistas.  I love knowing it was the muscles and lungs and opportunity that God gave me, that brought me to the top.  Motorcycles and cars are ascending without effort, but they miss the exhilaration of knowing what it takes to get there through sweat and hard work. And so, I will not dread the hills!  I will look at them as part of this amazing journey that we are enjoying.  I will meet them head-on and thrill over the challenge conquered as I see them fall behind me!"/>

<h1>The Dreaded Hill!</h1>
<h3>The dread!</h3>
<p>If I dread every hill I see before me, I would dread half my cycling adventure.  I came to this realization after bemoaning the fact that after cresting a monster of a hill, I could see another hill looming up ahead.  They keep coming!</p>
<h3>1st line of defense</h3>
<p>I had to come up with another approach to the dreaded hill!  I have a list of mantras’ I cajole myself with now when I see a hill ahead.  The first thing I tell myself is, “It will lay down!”  They always look the most menacing at a distance and as we get closer, the hill seems to lose its threat and take on a peaceful challenge.</p>
<h3>2nd line of defense</h3>
<p>If the hill is not cooperating and “laying down”, then I go to my second line of defense.  This involves working on my perspective.  I repeat phrases to myself as I laboriously pedal, “I chose this….this is what I do….some people go to work and I pedal up hills….</p>
<h3>3rd line of defense</h3>
<p>The third line of defense against the hills is my experience the second day out on this adventure.  We did not train for this cycling trip. On day two of our journey, we took on the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming.  It was 13 miles of 10% grade going up the hill with 80 lbs. of gear/bike to get to the top.  We ascended like snails to the top and it took forever.  We stood at the top and looked over the valley and celebrated.  Every hill since that time has been “just a slope” in comparison. “It’s just a slope”, Bruce will yell over his shoulder.</p>
<h3>The approach</h3>
<p>Bruce and I tackle hills totally differently.  Bruce has always fallen back on his brute, brawny strength for everything he tackles.  The hills are no different.  If he is falling short before cresting the top, he will stand up on his bike and throw his weight into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, love all 27 gears on my bike.  I am learning the art of balancing muscle pressure, speed and pedaling rhythm (cadence).  On the downhill slope, I try to gather all the speed I can get and then see how l can maximize it as I go up the next hill.  I love the feeling of efficiency and the thought of losing momentum without any gain is horrifying. I never take a low gear in anticipation of the need, rather, I wait until my legs tell me it is time. Then I gear down just enough to keep the cadence and pressure comfortable.</p>

<p>This may all seem tedious and uninteresting….but when half your cycling hours are involved in ascending hills, it is gloriously fulfilling.  I love the feeling of reward when the slope gives up its challenge and the view over the top opens up to new vistas.  I love knowing it was the muscles and lungs and opportunity that God gave me, that brought me to the top.  Motorcycles and cars are ascending without effort, but they miss the exhilaration of knowing what it takes to get there through sweat and hard work.</p>
<p>And so, I will not dread the hills!  I will look at them as part of this amazing journey that we are enjoying.  I will meet them head-on and thrill over the challenge conquered as I see them fall behind me!</p>
