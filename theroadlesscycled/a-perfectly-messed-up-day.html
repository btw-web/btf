<title>A perfectly messed-up day</title>
<meta name="description" content="An unassuming morning The morning started out a bit more relaxing than most.  We enjoyed some coffee and tea before we took our bikes out to begin our day&#8217;s ride.  Cycling touring always promises adventure on the road! Google had plotted a nice route along the coast, and we were expecting a short 45-mile pedal to our next camping spot in Chincoteague, Virginia.  We were looking forward to catching a glimpse of the famous wild ponies on Assateague Island.  It was a perfect day with clear skies and temperatures around 75 degrees.  Does it sound like I am setting the stage for a catastrophe?  It wasn’t really that bad…but it turned out amazing! Still going as planned&#8230; We arrived at Assateague Island as planned with just a little extra effort because of the wind.  We saw the famous ponies as we entered the National Park.  They were very used to people and showed no concern or even interest in our arrival.  It was great to see how healthy and content they appeared.  They were not running on the beach with their manes blowing in the wind as I thought they should be, they were just munching grass beside the road and looked like any western pony. National parks have no entry fees for bicycles we feel we get a great view of the surroundings from the saddle.  We continued our ride to an outstanding beach with great views of the dunes and Atlantic.  It was a perfect spot to eat some trail mix and sit to enjoy the coast. &nbsp; After our break, we continued south along the trail.  But in a few miles, we came to a gate that blocked the road that Google had suggested.  We were a bit mystified by this but not really deterred.  We looked at our Google Map and it clearly showed a bike route leading along this beach to our destination in Chincoteague.   No route was readily apparent. &nbsp; A change of plans This is where things started getting interesting.  There were a couple of 4-wheel drive trucks by the gate decreasing their tire pressure to drive on the beach. The sand was deep and soft.  We asked some of the drivers what they knew of our proposed route.  One couple said they weren’t sure about our bike route but offered to give us a ride in the back of their pickup till we could catch the trail again. Why not?  So, we loaded our bikes and jumped in the back of the truck and headed down the beach.  It was beautiful, the sand was deeeeeeep and definitely not ridable for our heavy bikes. &nbsp; We continued for about 5 miles down the beach.  The views were outstanding, but biking was still impossible.  At this point, we saw a park ranger and stopped to ask him about our “road” that Google had recommended.  When I showed him the bike route, he looked at me like I had totally lost my mind.  He laughed at me (in a nice way of course).  He went on to explain that not only is there no road, but that it was illegal to go through that part of the beach.  It was set apart as a bird nesting sanctuary.  In my nicest poor-lost-Wyoming-boy voice, I asked for options to get through.  He simply said, “There are none”.   Our only choice was to go back to where we had started from. &nbsp; Google again had led us astray.   But the upside was that the couple (Dave and Lynn) that we rode in the truck with, were amazing.  They offered to take us back so we could keep cycling or stay with them on the beach for a few hours. We decided to stay. Relaxing! Dave backed the pickup toward the ocean, and we all pulled out our chairs and our lunches.  We just enjoyed the beauty of this amazing place.  There were very few people in sight. The sky was bright blue, and the water reflected its joy. White sand surrounded us, and it was so quiet! We had no phone reception and had no place to go.  It was so delightful!  We took short walks on the beach and enjoy the sunshine. &nbsp; As we sat and relaxed, Dave noticed some dolphins not far offshore.  For nearly half an hour, we watched this large pod swim and play in front of us.  It was truly fascinating. &nbsp; After about three hours we headed back to the paved road.  We are so grateful for our new friends and the amazing day they gifted us with. &nbsp; Realizing we had a host for the next night (90 miles away) we wanted to cover some ground that evening before sleeping. We also had a considerable distance to backtrack on our bikes.  Cycling north, we left Assateague Island and our new friends. Love happy endings! The roads of rural Maryland were stunning. Oaks and tall straight pines lined the quiet twisting roads.   As dusk approached there were no campgrounds within an hour’s ride of us.  We realized that once again we would need to depend on the kindness of others.  We came upon a family taking an evening walk and asked them about possible spots to set up our tent.  They suggested we stop at a pastor’s home about a quarter of a mile up the road. We ended up being able to set up our tent behind the church.  We went to sleep that night exhausted but feeling totally amazing by an incredible day.  Pastor Ken even made us a cup of coffee and tea in the morning.  What a blessing! &nbsp; The day that had seemed to be turning into a miserable wreck, with a little help from Google, actually turned out just perfect.  We are thankful that the days do not always turn out as we plan!  Thanks, Google! &nbsp;"/>
