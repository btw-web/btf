<title>We have Stopped!</title>
<meta name="description" content="If you have been watching the black, squiggly line on our cycling blog map slowly progress around the perimeter of the USA, you might notice that it seems to have stopped.  You would be right!  We love the flexibility that the cycling lifestyle we live gives us.  We decide our destination a day or two in advance and even then, it changes.  This is one of those changes! &nbsp; We received a notice that Samaritan’s Purse was looking for medical personnel that would be willing to go to the Bahamas to help with the COVID crisis it was experiencing.  We said we could go right away and were so excited when we received the call that they would send us. &nbsp; Nurses again! &nbsp; Bruce and I both get to use our RN, BSN degrees.  The Island of Nassau has been overwhelmed with the amount of positive COVID cases it has experienced.  Samaritan’s Purse has set up a small response unit in the parking lot of Princes Margaret Hospital to help out. &nbsp; We stored our bikes in the garage of some new friends in Myrtle Beach.  Zander and Kai are Warmshower hosts that took us in.  They fed us a great dinner, gave us a place to sleep, and then even took us to the airport the next morning. &nbsp; But I am getting ahead of myself.  “Did you have all your nursing gear with you?”, I can hear you ask.   The answer is no.  We spent a crazy few days getting a COVID test and buying nursing scrubs and shoes that we could toss after the deployment.  A  letter approved by the Health Department of the Bahamas for us to enter the country had to be obtained.  We rode 10 miles riding around Myrtle Beach on our bikes getting it all done. &nbsp; Welcome to the Island! &nbsp; We flew to Nassau on Friday and joined a team of about 30 medical personnel.  The amount of people needed to pull this response off is amazing.  There are electricians, plumber, builders, finance, infection control staff, air conditioning, Information technologist, broadcasters, videographers, and doctors, and nurses.  We all started putting up tents and unloading crates to begin the setup. &nbsp; Tents have air conditioning and a negative airflow system. Lights are hung, oxygen flows to each bed, and all the medical supplies are placed.  A hot zone is set up with the patient tents surrounded by a 10-foot wide no man&#8217;s land and then the cold zone which is for all the non-medical staff.  Tents are set up for medical staff to put on personal protective equipment (PPE).  Another area is set up for staff to remove the PPE.  It is all very carefully thought through so that staff is protected as much as possible from getting COVID.  It is a huge responsibility that Samaritans Purse takes on! &nbsp; We have been here in Nassau for six days; time is going quickly. We have already been able to discharge a few patients, processes are getting smoother as we try to work under the local hospital, and every day we are getting more patients in to fill our wards.  The whole day staff starts every morning at 5:45 am and does not end the day till 8 pm.  It is a long but rewarding day.  We are thankful to see the night shift staff come and relieve us each evening! &nbsp; The Beach! &nbsp; We have had some of you tease us about us “roughing it” in the Bahamas.  It is well justified as the view out our window is the most beautiful beach I have ever seen.  Incredible aqua blue water, white sand beaches, and palm trees beckon us to come and enjoy.  We cannot get any closer to the beach than the view out our window.  The city is on lock-down and has a curfew.  Nobody is allowed on the roads on the weekend and it is controlled by the police.  The beaches are closed, no walking out of doors.  We drive through checkpoints by the police at times as we come home from our shift. They are working hard to curb the disease here on the island. &nbsp; We will be back! &nbsp; What an incredible opportunity we have been given.  We love the patients we are getting to serve and the other Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART)  members we are getting to work alongside.  I am adding a link for a short video done by Samaritans Purse of our time here.  You might recognize Bruce in the video, although we all look very much alike in our PPE.  The days are long and challenging, but we feel truly blessed to be here.  The bikes will be fun to pull out of storage in a few weeks and we will continue to head toward Key West Florida and then turn west.  Thank you for taking a detour with us on our adventures! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"/>

<h1>We have Stopped!</h1>
<p>If you have been watching the black, squiggly line on our cycling blog map slowly progress around the <a href="https://theroadlesscycled.com/bicycle-touring-let-the-adventure-begin/">perimeter of the USA,</a> you might notice that it seems to have stopped.  You would be right!  We love the flexibility that the cycling lifestyle we live gives us.  We decide our destination a day or two in advance and even then, it changes.  This is one of those changes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We received a notice that <a href="http://www.samaritanspurse.org/our-ministry/about-us/">Samaritan’s Purse</a> was looking for medical personnel that would be willing to go to the Bahamas to help with the COVID crisis it was experiencing.  We said we could go right away and were so excited when we received the call that they would send us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Nurses again!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bruce and I both get to use our RN, BSN degrees.  The Island of Nassau has been overwhelmed with the amount of positive COVID cases it has experienced.  Samaritan’s Purse has set up a small response unit in the parking lot of Princes Margaret Hospital to help out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We stored our bikes in the garage of some new friends in Myrtle Beach.  Zander and Kai are <a href="http://warmshowers.org">Warmshower</a> hosts that took us in.  They fed us a great dinner, gave us a place to sleep, and then even took us to the airport the next morning.</p>

<p>But I am getting ahead of myself.  “Did you have all your nursing gear with you?”, I can hear you ask.   The answer is no.  We spent a crazy few days getting a COVID test and buying nursing scrubs and shoes that we could toss after the deployment.  A  letter approved by the Health Department of the Bahamas for us to enter the country had to be obtained.  We rode 10 miles riding around Myrtle Beach on our bikes getting it all done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Welcome to the Island!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We flew to Nassau on Friday and joined a team of about 30 medical personnel.  The amount of people needed to pull this response off is amazing.  There are electricians, plumber, builders, finance, infection control staff, air conditioning, Information technologist, broadcasters, videographers, and doctors, and nurses.  We all started putting up tents and unloading crates to begin the setup.</p>
