<title>Maine from tip to tip!</title>
<meta name="description" content="We entered Maine on Highway 2 after coming through the White Mountains of New Hampshire. It was downhill and thick with trees on both sides of the road.  There is always a renewed energy as we cross state lines and anticipate new experiences and scenery.  We had rugged coastlines in mind, crashing waves, and cold water.  We looked forward to lobster and plates of seafood that are foreign to our Wyoming tastebuds.  Maine has been a highlight on our perimeter trip around the United States. Bethel Our first stop was a wonderful warm-showers host in Bethel, ME.  We ate fresh corn on the cob, had home-made blueberry cobbler, and great conversation.  Ray and Wendy are also cyclists and they talked us into making Lubec Maine our eastern destination rather than stopping at Bar Harbor.  Our route is always fluid as the local people tell us of places we need to visit or travel through. This makes every day a true adventure. Winthrop We camped outside of Winthrop at a small campground.  We have discovered a new way of vacationing that many people do.  People pull campers into these small campgrounds and leave them there year-round.  They set up white picket fences, welcome signs, pink flamingos, and a plethora of camping chairs around fire pits.  It is a small community and they come for a couple of months each summer, looking forward to connecting with their summer friends.  We are welcomed into the community as we show up on our bicycles and become the subject of much curiosity.  In Winthrop, we enjoyed the lake and beach scene and visited with friendly folks while we cooled off. Belfast Skirting around the capital of Augusta, we continued in tree-lined roads to Belfast.  It was so rewarding to come over the hill to Belfast and see our first ocean bay.  Boats lined the docks with their tall masts beckoning the explorer to come, sail away.  Parking our bikes, we scrambled over the low tide, rocky shore to the water.  I had to taste it to make sure it was really saltwater.  It was a destination feeling but we had a long way to go to get to Lubec.  We took our time and sat on a bench watching the slow pace of a small port.  The smell of fish and the taste of the salty air confirmed that we really were &#8220;down east&#8221;, as they call it. Ellsworth, Columbia Falls Taking our time cycling was the motto we rode by.  Anytime the ocean came into view, we would stop and drink it in.  We learned visiting with a local 20-something about the industry in Maine.  Jeff did seasonal work, going from &#8220;clamming&#8221; to blueberry harvesting, to &#8220;tipping&#8221; for wreaths at Christmas and finally to his passion which was boat building.  The fishing industry is intriguing and I would love to spend some time on the boats we watch in the bays.  Blueberries are a huge industry and we passed lots of rust-colored blueberry fields where the second crop of berries was growing.  Jeff explained how they harvest &#8220;wild blueberries&#8221;.  Eating &#8220;anything blueberry&#8221; became a daily goal of ours! We passed large sheds with semi-trailers loading up wreaths to transfer all over the country.  &#8220;Tipping&#8221; is the gathering of balsam branches for the wreaths.  There is lots of contention as people &#8220;tip&#8221; illegally on trees along the roads.  The wreaths are not just for Christmas but are also made by Wreaths Across America for veterans cemeteries nationwide. Lubec, Eastport Lubec is the easternmost town in the contiguous United States.  It seemed like a &#8220;given&#8221; that we had to make it our destination.  It is also home to Quoddy Head State Park and Lighthouse.  The lighthouse was constructed in 1808 in the Bay of Fundy.  We ate crab cakes in Lubec and took the ferry to Eastport to eat Lobster Rolls.  Food is obviously an important part of our day and we ask the local people where to get the best food. Eastport used to be home to 18 Sardine canneries and the second largest port after New York City.  Now it is mostly boarded-up storefronts and empty factories reminiscent of years gone by. Cutler, Jonesport, Bar Harbor, Bath&#8230; The small port towns were quickly our favorite destinations.  We cycled miles out of our way to sit and look out over the bays and watch the lobster boats at work.  We took a day to be tourists in Bar Harbor.  Waking up in the tent on our day off we heard the drizzle of rain.  We set up the tarp and spent a restful hour watching it rain with a cup of coffee.  Then we pedaled off into the drizzle to see the coast of Bar Harbor.  We climbed the cliffs and watched the waves crash relentlessly on the rocks below. Somehow the heavy clouds brought out the fierceness and the ruggedness of the coast. Freeport, Kennebunk, York Harbor, Kittery&#8230; Rails to Trails provided us with some great alternative routes down the coast.  Old railroad beds have been made into gravel paths that take one through deciduous forests.  It was fun to see lots of families out riding bikes and walking. Highway 1  kept us close to the coast on little winding roads.   The beaches were full of people and Bruce and I discussed how tough they are as the water is frigid.  The fog rolled in but their beach umbrella&#8217;s continued to go up and coolers were pulled across the sand. The people of Maine are a hardy bunch! We cycled 590 miles in the state of Maine and spent 2 weeks meandering a very leisurely route.  We loved the smells, tastes, and sights and we only saw the southern part of a huge state!  I know the timber industry in the north is huge as we would be passed by logging trucks headed south.  The smell of the pine would linger after they passed. Another day we may have to explore northern Maine but for now, we are content.  We have loved every minute of it and it exceeded our expectations.  I will leave my thanks with all the kind people who took care of us, and I will take my wonderful memories with me!"/>
