<meta name="description" content="The Hat Lady “Don’t you just get taard riding one of those things”, the women said with a southern twang.  Bruce and I were in a parking space along a busy main street, looking at our phones.  We were trying to see how Google suggested that we get out of town. I looked up to see a tiny slip of a lady with a broad-rimmed hat, large sunglasses, and a face mask, looking us over.  She was dressed very stylishly and had her purse hung in the crook of her elbow which left her wrist posed delicately in the air. I started to respond to her question, but it was not needed.  She was not looking for a response, she was looking for someone to listen.  So, with my mouth still forming my first word, she continued. “I have a housekeeper and a gardener back home, but here I have to do all the work myself.   My husband just retired after 30 years and I just discovered that he knows how to mop floors, can you imagine?” I still didn’t know better, so I tried again to form an answer and my words were left floating away unheeded. The southern twang continued, “I do ballet and do you know, I think it is not right for we older ladies with wrinkled necks to be doing the performances.  We should leave this for the young girls to do.”   This comment was accompanied by both of her hands stretching back her neck skin to show how unsightly it would be to have wrinkles and leotards in combination. By this time, Bruce had a slight twinge to his lip which I knew could come bursting forth in a laugh, but our sweet southern gal did not notice. She tossed her right wrist elegantly and exclaimed, “I have a golf game to play, y’all take care now”, and away she went up the sidewalk. Bruce and I were left looking at each other in wonder.  Did that really just happen?  We never interjected a single word, and yet this lady had just made our day.  We giggled about it for the rest of the day, hoping she played her golf game with the same vigor she put into our conversation. The cycling fanatic Bruce and I, again, were looking for the best route through a busy city.  We had pulled over by the side of the road, when we heard, “Road Warriors!” in a deep voice.  It wasn’t really a question, but a statement.  The guy pulled up beside us on his hard-tail mountain bike and grinned. Jeff, (we later learned his name), had on a white tank shirt, a bandana around his head, and a bushy white goatee.  After asking about our cycling journey, he wanted to know if we would like him to give us a tour of his city.  Always up for an adventure, we said, “yes!” Jeff took off on his bike and beckoned Bruce and me to follow.  We lumbered along behind him as our panniers felt like lead weight compared to his agile, lightweight bike frame. Jeff would turn side-saddle with his knee turned out and point expressively with his arm at various sites.  He knew his city well and proudly told us when buildings were built and the changes that had happened over the years. These periods of expressive hand waving and banter would be interspersed with jubilant and focused cycling. He had a radio rigged to his handlebars and it appeared to only work at full volume.  Johnny Cash, “The Man Comes Around” blared loudly while he rode.  Bruce and I felt like part of a crazy parade as we followed behind him.  I always feel like we draw stares with our loaded bikes, but now, the music seemed to announce our coming. To top off this adventure, Jeff did not worry about traffic rules.  Red lights to him were an opportunity to take a right-hand turn and then promptly do a U-turn.  He would do this repeatedly, rather than wait at a red light to turn left. Three right turns with a U-turn equals one left turn!  Stop signs are to be obeyed only if convenient.  It was a stretch for our law-abiding conscience to stay with him. Our tour lasted about 6 miles around the complete city!  The city will always be indelibly imprinted on my mind now. It is a city I know well.  Jeff left us close to where he picked us up with the same energy and enthusiasm and big smile."/>

<h3>The Hat Lady</h3>
<p>“Don’t you just get taard riding one of those things”, the women said with a southern twang.  Bruce and I were in a parking space along a busy main street, looking at our phones.  We were trying to see how Google suggested that we get out of town. I looked up to see a tiny slip of a lady with a broad-rimmed hat, large sunglasses, and a face mask, looking us over.  She was dressed very stylishly and had her purse hung in the crook of her elbow which left her wrist posed delicately in the air.</p>
