<title>Bicycle Touring- Let the adventure begin!</title>
<meta name="description" content="The dream of cycling –Have you ever had a dream that was so outlandish that you were hesitant to tell anyone? Sonja and I took our first bicycle touring trip through the Canadian Rockies almost thirty years ago. Since that first tour together we started dreaming of cycling across the United States. As the years passed, the dream grew and what was once a ride across the country somehow evolved. It has now become selling everything, quitting our jobs, and riding a bike around the perimeter of the United States, a journey of nearly 18,000 miles. Happening now…Over the years we have taken numerous small, self-supported bicycle tours which kept the dream alive, fueling our passion to see America from the saddle of a bike. With great excitement, we are beginning to take the final steps to move forward with our dream. We have been saving money for several years and writing letters for sponsorships, though not very successfully. Sonja has let the hospital know that she will be leaving at the end of May. Last week I let the college where I teach know that this will be my last semester. What’s next…So, what’s next? We have have been accumulating our bike touring equipment for years. In the past month’s we have been trying to finalize other needed purchases. We have developed a rather extensive to-do list to get done before we leave. There is the writing of a will, getting our finances in order, and figuring out how to get bills paid. We also need to decide where to store belongings, what to keep and what to sell, and when and how to sell the house. The list grows daily. We are now just over a hundred days out from our scheduled departure date. I already wake up at night wondering how am I going to sleep all night in a tiny tent. I have trouble sleeping all night in a comfortable bed. What will we do when it is raining hard, or it is so windy we can’t move forward. How will we find convenient places to use the bathroom and bathe. Then there is the big question, ‘can we afford to do this’? Then I get a huge smile on my face as I can’t wait; these are a few of the challenges that make a great adventure. I hope you will join us as we follow our dream. Come with us and be part of our journey. &nbsp;"/>
