<meta name="description" content="The Places The places that we have seen have been beautiful and awe-inspiring.  Yes even in North Dakota!  The vastness of the plains is humbling to me.  The wide-reaching fertile soil and the endurance and vision of the farmers and ranchers who settled it over a hundred years ago are inspiring.  The wildlife we have seen include moose, ducks, fox, skunks, turkeys, deer, elk, and many others.  What a tremendous pleasure to be able to experience some of this rich scenery and heritage. But it was the friendships that were forged that made it special! The People People, amazing people!  We have had the pleasure of meeting so many friendly and warm people.  Let me tell you about an incredible evening we had and a friendship we developed!   We met Robear and Stephanie through Warmshowers, a bicycle touring network that we are part of.  What a privilege it was!  Although we have been a host for Warmshowers for many years, we have never stayed with a host until last week.  It was less than 24 hours ahead of our intended visit that we contacted Robear and Stephanie but they graciously agreed to let us camp in their yard. Robear also offered the use of their shower and provide us with an incredible supper and breakfast. The meal I thought we would be in for something special when we arrived in town early and Robear said just come on over.  He graciously offered to take us the grocery store to get staples for the coming days (riding your bike a few extra miles is a lot after a day of touring). When we returned from the store,  Robear and Stephanie began to prepare a feast.   The meal included: steak, brats, salmon, cod, chicken, asparagus, kale salad, and some excellent bottles of wine.  Robear is a self-taught chef and values delicious food and the whole eating experience.  The meal was outstanding and we lingered long at the table. The conversation The conversation was delightful and rich.  Robear has literally bicycled all over the world and extensively in the USA.   He told some hair-raising stories of cycling in Russia.  Stephanie and he actually met and developed their friendship because of cycling.  After they were married they cycled from Barcelona to Paris together. We talked late and thought we should end the evening and go out to our tent for bed, but then Robear grabbed his guitar and started to strum.  Stephanie then started to sing and they both sang a ballad to end the evening.  It was an evening to remember! The friendship We are so blessed by this great couple and we now count them in our circle of friends in the great state of North Dakota.  The places we have been able to cycle to become more special because of the friendships we have made!"/>

<h1>Beautiful Places and Amazing People</h1>
<h2>The Places</h2>
<p>The places that we have seen have been beautiful and awe-inspiring.  Yes even in North Dakota!  The vastness of the plains is humbling to me.  The wide-reaching fertile soil and the endurance and vision of the farmers and ranchers who settled it over a hundred years ago are inspiring.  The wildlife we have seen include moose, ducks, fox, skunks, turkeys, deer, elk, and many others.  What a tremendous pleasure to be able to experience some of this rich scenery and heritage. But it was the friendships that were forged that made it special!</p>
<h2>The People</h2>
<p>People, amazing people!  We have had the pleasure of meeting so many friendly and warm people.  Let me tell you about an incredible evening we had and a friendship we developed!   We met Robear and Stephanie through <a href="http://warmshowers.org">Warmshowers</a>, a bicycle touring network that we are part of.  What a privilege it was!  Although we have been a host for Warmshowers for many years, we have never stayed with a host until last week.  It was less than 24 hours ahead of our intended visit that we contacted Robear and Stephanie but they graciously agreed to let us camp in their yard.
