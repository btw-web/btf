<title>A Step Back in Time.</title>
<meta name="description" content="The visit In the hills of western New York, we got to step back in time.  Through connections of a friend, Bruce and I got to visit an Amish farm.  Joe and Rebecca live in a newly built house with a big front porch across the driveway from the big farmhouse that they have turned over to their son.  Danny now runs the farm and Joe helps out when needed. We drove up in the pickup of our friend Matt and Joe came out to greet us. Joe did not know we were coming but was very warm and gracious when he heard that Matt had sent us.  He was dressed in homespun cotton blue pants and a light blue shirt with suspenders.  He had the typical long white beard and no mustache with curly grey hair but his straw hat had been left in the house, Joe invited us in and when Bruce spoke of his own agriculture background, they were soon deep in conversation with Bruce asking questions.  I had a whole different take on things. I wanted to know what life was like for a typical Amish woman.  Rebecca was wiping off the oilcloth covered table from their morning coffee when Joe led us in.  Rebeca was wearing a dark blue sown dress and white bonnet.  She was barefoot and had a well used grey apron covering her dress.  She smiled at me but seemed very shy. The House The kitchen was large and clean with a new black kitchen woodstove taking center stage.  Instead of cupboards, there were beautifully crafted oak buffets, each with their purpose.  One held a crafted stainless steel sink that was about four feet long.  Another had drawers and cupboards.  The floor was hardwood and beautiful. Joe led us into the living room which was just an extension of the kitchen.  The big stove separated the two rooms.  There were four handcrafted rocking chairs facing each other in the room and we were both motioned to one to sit in.  Bruce and I were both surprised at how comfortable they were.  A buffet holding some blue glassware and a desk holding some books lined the wall.  A treadle sewing machine was between two low windows and a single bed was made up against another wall.  The only color used was different shades of blue; curtains, chair cushions, bedspread, and their clothes.  The walls were stark white with sky blue trim. The Family Joe called his son Danny in to meet us and Danny was carrying his 10-month-old daughter in his arms.  She was dressed in a homemade dress and white bonnet.  She looked like a little china doll and was happy to be the center of attention.  Rebecca got up then and when she came back in the room she was carrying another china doll, twin girls!  Rosy cheeks and smiles, I could not tell them apart,  Rebecca was quite proud and both girls were set down to play at Grandmas&#8217;s feet. With some coaxing and questions, I learned that Rebecca has eleven children and most of them live very close by.  She twitched a smile as she told me she had 57 grandchildren.  Her son Danny just has the twins but has a huge house to fill, but her son across the street has 8 children at this time.  They all go to Amish schools which look very much like the one-room country schools many years ago.  Most Amish children attend school only till the eighth grade.  They are very involved in the work of the farm.  I will let Bruce take over and tell you more about the farming aspect from Joe. The Farm The conversation with Joe was fascinating, so many years of knowledge and wisdom that only time builds.  I wanted to get his perspective on agriculture and the future from the eyes of a seasoned Amish farmer.  I asked questions about what it is like to try to be successful in agriculture as an Amish farmer.  Joe&#8217;s answers were honest and hints of concern were obvious as he shared.  Just as others in American agriculture are facing challenges with economics and battling low commodity prices, so are the Amish. To counter the hardships of an agriculture existence, most of the Amish farmers have been forced to be more resourceful and entrepreneurial.   The Amish families have opened shops to help with cash flow.  Businesses have been started that include; cabinet making, leatherwork, building sheds, cutting and milling lumber, building furniture, building and repairing wagons, and selling produce and baked goods, just to name a few. Many of the younger men have opted to take jobs off the farm working construction, or whatever else is available.  Joe expressed concern with this as the draw of the American culture has a great influence on those who are surrounded by it every day.  It was intriguing to me to learn that the Amish families face so many of the same challenges as other farm families in rural America, being drawn to greater opportunity off the farm.  This is increasingly concerning as they desire to keep their young adults within the Amish community and the attraction of the world is continually pulling at them. I enjoyed a walk down memory lane with Joe as we looked over his farm equipment and I realized I have seen and used much of this equipment at some time in my past.  Truly the Amish families are not so different from the other farm families in the U.S."/>
