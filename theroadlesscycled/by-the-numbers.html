<meta name="description" content="Just a quick review of today by the numbers.  We have been moving along at a slightly faster clip than expected and each day seems to hold its treasures and its challenges.  For example; when we went to bed last night we knew that we had a 70% chance of waking up to rain.  We planned accordingly and sure enough at five a.m., it started to rain.  So we slept till 6:30 and it just kept raining.  We had things packed to allow us to quickly pack-up and move out, so by 6:50, we were on the road in a nice gentle rain.  We checked the forecast again and sure enough 100% chance of rain all day, and through the night.  So as I write this blog we are sitting in a motel room, out of the rain, and 100% pleased to be indoors drying things out. Back to the numbers. I thought it would be fun to review our trip by the numbers, the things we kept track of, or can recall. So let&#8217;s look back.  We started the trip on May 26th, in Powell Wyoming. 71 days 3746 miles 6  down days (less than 30 miles of cycling) 53 miles per day average (57 miles per day not counting down days) 7 nights in motel rooms 8 nights with WarmShowers host (an online network for housing fellow bicycle tourist) 10 nights hosted by friends or family 53 nights sleeping in our tent (at hosts, campgrounds, churches, yards, etc.) 8 flat tires 1 new tire 1 broken spoke 4 lbs of peanut butter 11 laundrymats (maybe 1 off here) 1 case of poison Ivy 1 new sleeping pad 2 bottles of chain lube 15 afternoon samplings of ice cream vendors across the northern states 3 bicycle wrecks 1 smashed bicycle helmet (it blew into the drive-through lane at a coffee shop and got ran over) 0 lost or missing socks 1,000,001 mosquito bites (this number is an approximation I lost count after 894,256) 9 fails  by Google in providing directions onto closed roads, locked gates, or private property Hundreds of great conversations with fun and interesting people (and many new friends) More beauty than I can remember 3 days of riding in the rain 22 combined pounds lost even with Oreos and Pringles as a regular diet! 1,000,000 great new memories and experiences &nbsp;"/>
