<meta name="description" content="Caring through COVID How do I summarize four weeks of working as a nurse in Nassau during the peak of COVID-19?  We went with a non-profit organization called Samaritans Purse.  They provide spiritual and physical aid to victims of war, natural disasters, disease, famine, poverty, and persecution in more than 100 countries with the purpose of sharing God’s love through His son, Jesus Christ. Setting up In the Bahamas Samaritans Purse provided a fully staffed 30-bed hospital that was set up and running in 3 days.  It was incredible to be part of the set-up crew and watch these tents go up so quickly.  Running water, electricity, air conditioning, and oxygen were all fed to the tents.  A few experts organized all of us; nurses unloading crates, doctors pulling electrical wires, EMT’s setting up beds.  Everyone pitched in and it came together quickly. &nbsp; The daily work. We had three tents set up for 30 patients with 10 beds in each tent.  Bruce and I started out working the day shift in the men’s ward.  We switched around responsibilities as the need and number of patients changed.  There were two nurses per tent and two medical doctors on the day shift.  EMT’s worked with us as well and it was such fun comradery. We really enjoyed the variety of work we performed.  We both initially worked in the patient wards, but by the third week, we had other responsibilities.  Sonja became a charge nurse helping with coordinating staff and patient needs.  Bruce moved to the Infection Prevention Control team, which help provide education regarding COVID to over 1100 hospital staff.  This involved three of us teaching classes three times a day. &nbsp; The people The Bohemian people were the highlight of the trip!  I learned so much from them.  They were so grateful for the care we gave them.  With the beds lined up next to each other in the tent, they chatted, laughed, and encouraged each other to be strong.  With oxygen flowing through cannulas and masks, they made friends with whoever was around them. &nbsp; Some new facts I learned about Bohemians in Nassau: The heat does not bother them, while we would drip with sweat, they would request another blanket! The rain is something to be avoided at all costs. For being a tropical island with constant rain, this came as a surprise.  They believe it will make you sick if you are in it, so no patients are discharged in the rain or admitted if it rains.  Nobody goes to work if it rains or attends any scheduled meetings. Chicken and rice are the preferred meal for lunch and supper. We will not eat chicken and rice for a few weeks after landing in the USA. Tuna fish and sardines are common for breakfast with grits! &nbsp; The weather The days were consistently 84 degrees with 100 % humidity.  We had lots of rain to deal with.  Then we would run around trying to make sure it didn’t flow into the tents.  When the sun would come out, the intensity of it would make us drip with sweat.  The PPE (the Personal Protection Equipment) that we wore trapped in all the heat.  The Bohemians seemed to be very comfortable in the heat and never complained.  We learned much from their attitudes. The Bahamas We truly enjoyed the beauty of the island, although our free time was very limited.  The vegetation is amazingly diverse with such a variety of shapes and colors.  And one cannot go to the Bahamas without noticing the white sand beaches and aqua blue water. The island was in lock-down while we were there and so we did not get to the beach until the day before we left.  It is absolutely breathtaking.  Someday, we will definitely need to look into a vacation on some of the islands. Cycling South! As of today, we are back in the USA on our bikes.  Packing up the panniers this morning was super exciting.  We missed the open road!  The unrelenting rain today could not dampen our spirits as we cycled south! Onward and Southward!!"/>
