<title>Lessons we are Learning!</title>
<meta name="description" content="Week One of Lessons we have learned A week into our adventure and we have already learned some great lessons.  So here are just a few.  First, as you already know, physical stress is only a small part of the challenge.  But let me share of few physical challenges we have already overcome.  Soreness, of course, all pain is relative.  On day eight we realize that the pain on our backside is no longer a large focus.  The pain in our neck and shoulders has also started to wane and in fact, we cycled 54 miles today without much pain at all. Lesson of Endurance Endurance is and will continue to be a challenge for our entire journey. Just like all the hills we face in our life, each incline (we now prefer to call them slopes, it sounds much less daunting) is best taken one step (or pedal) at a time.  So the lesson we are learning;  Don&#8217;t worry about what is around the next curve, or over the next hill, just know that you have the strength for what you can see.  It is also important for us to remember that we have limits, but we often set them too low and we are capable of more than we thought possible. The reward at the top of a hill is energizing! Lesson of Rest It has been awesome to see how quickly our mind and body adjust to the situation we have when it comes to rest and sleep.  I actually lost some hours of sleep prior to departing on our trip over this issue.  Stressing over how I would ever be able to sleep all night in a tent and be comfortable enough to get rest.  After a week, I don&#8217;t even think about it now. I know I will be tired at the end of the day and I am ready to crawl in the tent every evening.  Once I am in my sleeping bag I have learned that now expect a good night of sleep. So on to week two! Another great lesson we are learning is not to dwell on the destination and miss the journey.  The destination has always been a motivator for me. As I cycle I realize that I had become so focused on the endpoint of the day, I was missing the best our adventure had to offer at the moment  I am in the process of reprogramming myself.  I have forced myself to change the settings on my odometer so I cannot read the miles we have done.  I am trying to not dwell on where we will sleep each night or what we will eat each evening, but instead, plan and trust, live the experience, and not obsess on the destination. At this point, I can say that the journey has been challenging at times, painful at moments, and stretching in many ways.  I am learning these lessons slowly but I can say, there are no regrets, the entire world is beautiful in May/June and I can&#8217;t wait to see what is around the next corner and over the next hill."/>
