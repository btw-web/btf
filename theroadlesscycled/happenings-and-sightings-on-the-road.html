<title>Happenings and Sightings on the Road</title>
<meta name="description" content="Every trip seems to have some crazy mishaps and unusual sightings.  We have had a few of our own. Sadly, I have been in a panic during some of them and forgot to take pictures of them to record for you all. Glasses The second day out from our cycling trip, Bruce stepped on his glasses. He was washing off in the creek and laid them down. Then he stepped back and stepped on them causing the frames to bend and the lenses to pop out. Thankfully, he raised two boys that were hard on glasses. Bruce has fixed them many times for the boys and he was able to take care of these also. It could have been a terrible mishap but was averted. Helmet In North Dakota, we stopped at a coffee shop. We leaned our bikes against the wall and went in to have coffee. It happened to be windy that day (and every other day we were in North Dakota!) My bike fell over and apparently my helmet rolled out into the driving lane of the drive-up window. A vehicle drove right over it and kept going. When I came out of the coffee shop, I picked up my bike but could not find my helmet. I found it on the road and it looked normal. When I picked it up, the helmet unfolded like an accordion. I was shocked. We had to make a trip across town to Walmart to find a replacement. Phone I carry my phone in a flexible rubber holder on the front of my bike. One morning about 10 miles down the road, I looked down and my phone was gone! PANIC!! My phone is also my wallet and my credit card and license were in the back of it. I yelled ahead to Bruce and then turned around and started riding back on the wrong side of the busy road. We had no choice but to ride against traffic, and I kept looking in the ditch wondering how far it could bounce.  Praying like crazy that God would protect it from falling into the wrong hands and that I would be able to find it.It was five miles back that I saw my phone laying upside down right in the middle of the shoulder of the road. All my cards were in the back of the phone. The plastic protective screen was scratched all up, but nothing else was wrong with it. I was singing all sorts of praises to Jesus for answered prayer! Tent site On Madalene Island there are two campgrounds (Big Bay State Park and Big Bay Town Park).  We were not aware of this and pulled into the first campground we got to.  The number of the campsite was correct and we set everything up.  Sleeping bags were laid out to dry and we blew up the air mattresses.  You guessed it&#8230;we were in the wrong campground.  Thankfully, Bruce noticed on the map that there were two campgrounds.  We were saved the embarrassment of someone else pointing out that we were in their site.  Being pros now at setting up and packing up the gear, we moved to the next one quickly! Wildlife We have seen lots of wildlife!  Moose, deer, fox, antelope, eagles, skunks, elk, raccoons, and sandhill cranes were all fun sightings.  The highlights were a lion, a wolf, and a bear.  I was unable to pull out my phone and take pictures of the mountain lion as he was lounging in the sun on a sandy bluff too close to the road for me to stop and gawk!  I stopped by bike for a moment but I got nervous and kept riding.  He was about 60 miles northwest of Gillette Wyoming. The wolf I saw in the UP of Michigan.  He was on a logging road that took off from the road I was cycling on.  I glanced up the road and saw him and then turned my bike around and went back to take another look.  He turned and saw me and then loped off in a disinterested way up the trail.  He was grey/brown and very narrow hipped.  Taking a picture didn&#8217;t even cross my mind until it was too late. The bear crossed in front of us on a back road west of Mackinac City.  It was still early in the morning and everything was wet.  When we got close to where he had crossed, there was no sign of him, only his very large wet tracks crossing the road.  That was close enough for me to see a bear and I am glad he was not waiting around in the bushes to check us out."/>

<h1>Happenings and Sightings on the Road</h1>

<p>Every trip seems to have some crazy mishaps and unusual sightings.  We have had a few of our own. Sadly, I have been in a panic during some of them and forgot to take pictures of them to record for you all.</p>
