<title>Just another Step</title>
<meta name="description" content="Every journey is made up of many small steps, and we are continuing on our journey by taking one small step after another.  Some of these steps have included;  securing gear, learning to fly a drone, developing a blog, preparing family, organizing finances, and now, selling our house.  We have literally been dreaming for years and planning for months but selling our house truly seems like a huge leap after a series of small steps. Choices of Freedom When we decide to bike around America we knew we didn’t want to be tied to any location.  We also knew wanted to have freedom from bills or responsibilities for a rental property so selling our house made perfect sense.  But with this decision comes a plethora of others.  What things do we keep?  What items should we try to sell?  Can we keep it at my sister’s?  Do we need a storage unit?  Should we keep a car?  Will the kids wants this? And so many more.  But with all of these challenging decisions also comes a sense of freedom that we haven’t felt in a long time, less clutter and a growing sense of freedom from things. The days are getting longer as we get closer to summer and our time with a roof over our head is getting shorter.  At times we feel a twinge of concern, or maybe even fear, question creep into our minds about our own mental toughness and will this work with aging parents and our own kids needing support at times.  But the reality is that every dream and every journey comes with a price, and if we are ever going to realize this we will have to make a few sacrifices, and feel a little pain to experience what we have dreamt for. Dream! What’s Yours? The reality is that by signing the buy/sell agreement on our house, getting rid of some unneeded items, and selling a few remnants of being settled in our urban life are really just a few more small steps in our journey to realize our dream.  So this makes me wonder, what’s your dream, and what steps are you taking to realize your dream?  Please share with us your dream and a few of those steps you are taking."/>
