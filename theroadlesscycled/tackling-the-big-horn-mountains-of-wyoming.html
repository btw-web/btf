<title>Tackling the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming</title>
<meta name="description" content="The ascent! Since we could not start in Montana as planned due to Covid-19, we opted for the second option that sent us up over the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming.  This would then get us to South Dakota and then we can head north, towards the Canadian border.  This would put us on track to be near the border of the U.S.  since our goal is to bicycle the perimeter of the country. &nbsp; We have explored the Big Horn Mountains from a vehicle and hiking many times but this would be a whole new adventure.  The 12 miles of 10% grade did make us nervous!  We have not trained for this bike ride and knew this was going to be a challenge.  The  45 lbs of gear on each bike made our ascent at times it felt as if we were dragging an anchor! We felt like the little train, &#8220;I think I can, I think I can&#8230;&#8221; as we counted reflector posts as they slowly went by.  At times we could do two reflector posts before we stopped to breathe and let our thighs stop burning. The Big Horn Mountains were living up to their reputation. We stopped to enjoy the view often and ate our lunch and snacks looking out over the vast, green (for Wyoming) valley.  It was energizing to see that we were making progress. THE TOP! It got colder as we climbed and we should not have been surprised at the snow we encountered at the top.  The campground where we were hoping to stay the first night was not available&#8230;Ha!  We had to put in a few more miles to find open and dry ground to camp on. The snow wasn&#8217;t this deep across all of the Big Horns Mountains, but this drift was impressive and we had to stop for a photo. We camped at a beautiful stream and slept hard after our workout from the day. The next morning we woke up to fog and cold.  The downhill slopes felt incredible as we finally got to have some enjoyable coasting.  The road meanders across high meadows and stream beds covered with willows.  The moose love to eat the tender greens around the willow beds and find good protection. We spotted 16 moose eating in the morning fog.  A herd of elk wandered the hillside and we even heard them bulging (unusual for springtime).  We also came upon a fox, a Sand Hill Crane, and watched many Mountain Bluebirds flit about. GOING DOWN! The ride down the Big Horns was FREEZING!  We had to put on all our warm gear for the descent.  It must have been in the low 40 degrees and the wind chill numbed the fingers.  We enjoyed the ride without pedaling and the nearly 30 miles of downhill progress. The green ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Big Horns Mountains beckons us.   Riding on! &nbsp;"/>

<h1>Tackling the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming</h1>
<h1>The ascent!</h1>
<p>Since we could not start in Montana as planned due to Covid-19, we opted for the second option that sent us up over the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming.  This would then get us to South Dakota and then we can head north, towards the Canadian border.  This would put us on track to be near the border of the U.S.  since <a href="https://theroadlesscycled.com/bicycle-touring-let-the-adventure-begin/">our goal is to bicycle the perimeter of the country</a>.</p>
