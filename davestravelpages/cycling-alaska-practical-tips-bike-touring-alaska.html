<h2>Bike Touring in Alaska</h2>
<p>It was back in 2009 that I was last cycling in Alaska. I suspect that not a great deal has changed. It's a big place, it's cold, and there are only a few main roads.</p>
<p>It's also an outdoor adventurers paradise, and a great destination for bicycle touring. If plenty of wild camping, challenging terrain, and a sense of remoteness are your thing, you're going to love an Alaska bike tour!</p>

<h2>A Guide to Cycling in Alaska</h2>
<p>As my experiences of cycling in Alaska followed a route from Deadhorse, through Fairbanks, and on to Canada, I can't comment about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denali_National_Park_and_Preserve">Denali</a>, perhaps Alaska's most famous national park.</p>
<p>Instead, all the information here was gathered whilst <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-from-alaska-to-argentina-the-pan-american-highway">cycling along what is known as the Pan-American Highway</a>.</p>
<p>If you do want to find out about other parts of Alaska though, this <a href="https://www.valisemag.com/10-days-alaska-itinerary-guide/">10 day itinerary for Alaska</a> is ideal further reading.</p>

<h2>Cycle Alaska</h2>
<p>For this cycling guide, I've broken the information down into sections I think you will find most relevant if you are planning a bike tour in Alaska.</p>
<p>For other questions relating to cycling the Pan-American highway, you might want to check out <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/bike-touring-questions-answered-cycling-pan-american-route.html">this blog post</a>.</p>

<h2>When to go cycling in Alaska</h2>
<p>Unless you specifically want to cycle Alaska in the snow (and some people do with their fat bikes and spike tyres), there's really only a narrow window of time to choose from.<br />

amzn_assoc_search_bar = "true";
amzn_assoc_tracking_id = "davstrapag-20";
amzn_assoc_ad_mode = "manual";

amzn_assoc_marketplace = "amazon";
amzn_assoc_region = "US";

</script><br />
<script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US"></script></p>
<p>Without going into too much analysis here, June and July are your two best months to choose from. If you are cycling south on a Pan-American cycling trip, then June is probably the best&nbsp;of the two.</p>
<p>Even in June, you can still expect the odd cold night up in the north. Although I never experienced any, my guess is that snow might also be randomly possible, especially given how crazy the planet's weather is over the last few years.</p>
<p>Weather wise, rain can always be an issue, and some of the rough roads turn to sludge when this happens.</p>
<p>If you are cycling in Alaska in June, you will also experience the phenomenon of 24 hour sunlight. It goes without saying that the further&nbsp;north you are, the colder it becomes, no matter what time of year you are there.</p>
<h2>Where to stay in Alaska on a bike tour</h2>
<p>Private rooms in motels and hotels are not cheap, and especially so in Deadhorse. Hostels are an affordable option, and the Warmshowers network has several kindly hosts in the state.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/couchsurfing-travel-like-a-local">Couchsurfing</a> is another way to go. Really though, camping is going to be the number one choice when bike touring in Alaska.</p>
<p>You can choose from official sites, or <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/component/content/article/125-bicycle-touring-tips/922-how-to-wild-camp-when-bicycle-touring-around-the-word.html">wild camp</a> in the more remote areas.</p>
<p>Wild camping will also help you to <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cut-costs-on-a-bicycle-tour.html/">reduce costs when bike touring</a> &#8211; something most cyclists on the road for any length of time are keen on!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3364 aligncenter" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/this-is-why-i-do-it1.jpeg" alt="wild camping in Alaska" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/this-is-why-i-do-it1.jpeg 400w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/this-is-why-i-do-it1-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<h2>Food and Drink</h2>
<p>When planning your cycling route in Alaska, you may have to consider how much food to carry with you. There are several stretches of road, where it is advisable to carry 2 or 3 days worth of food.</p>
<p>If you are budget conscious, you might want to carry more, as prices are obviously higher for food the further away from civilisation you get. Don't expect a full range of groceries in small settlements and towns. Sometimes it's just a case of eating what's there.</p>
<p>Here's some suggestions of what <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/best-foods-for-bicycle-touring.html/">food to stock up on for bike touring</a> whenever you get to a bigger place. Taking a cooking stove is a good idea for people planning to cycle Alaska.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3109 aligncenter" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/joy.jpeg" alt="The settlement of Joy in Alaska" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/joy.jpeg 400w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/joy-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Water is available from lakes and rivers, although will need to be filtered before drinking. Tap water is potable, but it's worth checking first.</p>
<p>In the more remote areas, it's worth thinking ahead in order to work out how much water to carry. <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/3-reasons-to-use-a-travel-water-filter-for-bike-touring/">Carrying a water filter</a> is a good idea when biking in Alaska. I've reviewed a <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/water-bottle-with-filter-for-travel-drinksafe-travel-tap-review/">bottle with water filter here</a> I currently use for bike touring.</p>

<h2>Bicycle stuff</h2>
<p>It's going to pay to be reasonably self-sufficient in terms of spares and tools when cycling in Alaska. Outside of Anchorage and Fairbanks, you won't be seeing a bike shop. A bicycle tool kit like the one below should cover most situations.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jvvO9Uu0bLs" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Roads and traffic in Alasksa</h2>
<p>There's a mix of roads to experience when cycling in Alaska! Perhaps the most notorious, is the <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-the-haul-road-in-alaska.html">Haul Road or Dalton Highway</a>. This is an unsealed rough road with a number of hill and mountain passes.</p>
<p>Having a bike capable of cycling along rough roads is definitely going to help! Back onto the sealed roads though, and cyclists will find the roads relatively smooth, with a slight shoulder to use, and little traffic. Roadworks can (or at least were) an issue from time to time.</p>

<h2>Dangers and annoyances</h2>
<p>The two main dangers and annoyances when cycling in Alaska are bears and mosquitoes. And to be honest, I'm not sure which one annoyed me the most.</p>
<p>Probably the mosquitoes actually. They were vociferous, and seemed to collect in huge gangs, waiting for me to leave the tent in the morning!</p>
<p>I saw bears a couple of times, but took all the correct precautions in terms of keeping food away from my tent etc. I also carried some bear spray which I never used, and discarded at the border with Canada.</p>
