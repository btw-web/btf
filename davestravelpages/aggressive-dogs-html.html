<h2>Best dog repellent for cyclists</h2>
<p>Before I dive into this guide on dogs and cycling, here's some products designed to offer the best protection against dogs when on a bicycle.</p>

<h2>How to deal with dogs while cycling</h2>
<p>Dealing with aggressive dogs on a bike tour can be a stressful and somewhat unnerving experience at first.</p>
<p>The sight and sound of an aggressive dog running up to your bike, barking and snarling makes you realise just how exposed you are on a bicycle.</p>
<p>Even if you are cycling with another person, the initial encounters may still trigger a &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_or_Flight">fight or flight</a>&#8221; response. Neither of these reactions is the best way to deal with aggressive dogs on a cycle tour though.</p>
<p>A calmer, more thought out approach is always better, and hopefully this article will help you to develop your own strategy in dealing with dogs.

<h2>Dog Aggression Towards Bikes</h2>
<p>Why do dogs chase bikes?</p>
<p>Whilst I don't claim to be a canine expert, I have had more than a few encounters with dogs when cycling. I haven't been bitten (yet!!), but <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/bethel-to-flores-html.html">one did make me suffer a low speed crash</a>.</p>
<p>I actually felt more embarrassed by it than hurt, as I doubt I was going even 1 MPH at the time! When I came off, the dog stopped barking and left the scene with a kind of satisfied swagger just to rub it in. I wasn't smiling!</p>
<p>On a serious note though, there was a lesson to be learned which I will describe later.</p>
<h2>Dealing With Wild Dogs on a Bicycle Tour</h2>
<p>First of all, lets put this into some sort of context for anyone who comes from a country where the majority of dogs are kept as pets, and are normally on leashes.</p>
<p><strong>Newsflash</strong> &#8211; The rest of the world doesn't think like you do! Dogs are kept only if they serve a purpose. This purpose might be herding livestock, hunting vermin or game, or guarding property.</p>
<p>The one thing they all have in common, is that they are working within a territory which they consider to be their own. Within this territory, there will be a pecking order with an Alpha at the very top.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11823 size-full" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/how-to-deal-with-aggressive-dogs.jpg" alt="How to deal with aggressive dogs" width="640" height="424" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/how-to-deal-with-aggressive-dogs.jpg 640w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/how-to-deal-with-aggressive-dogs-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2>Aggressive wild dogs</h2>
<p>If dogs are not kept, then they are scavengers or wild. They will still have a territory which they consider their own, but are less likely to actively protect it against a cyclist.</p>
<p>As food is probably harder to come by, they would instead save their energy for the battles that really count, such as protecting their territory against other dogs.</p>
<p>Scavengers or wild dogs will sometimes work in packs. Cyclists are less likely to encounter packs, but it does happen from time to time. Facing off against a pack of wild dogs is not something that you want to do for fun.</p>
<h2>What does this mean for the cyclist then?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9407" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cycling-across-europe-travel-budget.jpg" alt="Full details of my travel budget from cycling across Europe in 2016" width="1032" height="580" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cycling-across-europe-travel-budget.jpg 1032w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cycling-across-europe-travel-budget-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cycling-across-europe-travel-budget-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cycling-across-europe-travel-budget-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cycling-across-europe-travel-budget-800x450.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1032px) 100vw, 1032px" /></p>
<p>Although you might be happily cycling along believing that the road belongs to you, in reality, you will be cycling through many different dog's territories.</p>
<p>In countries where dogs are leashed or trained as pets, you might not ever notice this (unless you are a postman of course). In other countries though, the dogs will come out and actively protect that territory from the unknown.</p>
<p>And you, my friend, are the unknown! The only way a dog can protect it's territory is by proving it is the Alpha. It does this by barking, snarling, and if it is brave or close enough, biting. It's nothing personal.</p>
<h2>Dealing with Aggressive Dogs on a Bicycle Tour &#8211; Dangers</h2>
<p>The dangers of dealing with aggressive dogs on a bicycle tour should not be underestimated. If a dog runs towards you while riding you could have an encounter that ends with injury or worse. Here are the main dangers &#8211;</p>
<h2>Dogs can cause accidents when cycling</h2>
<p>This is where I return to my earlier story of a dog making me crash the bike.</p>
<p>I was cycling around a tight switchback bend on a gravel uphill section. As mentioned, the speed was negligible and my pride hurt more than the fall.</p>
<p>Imagine this though at a higher speed, and it could have ended up in cuts, bruises or even broken bones. If a truck had been tailgating me, I might have ended up getting run over as well.</p>
<p>Why did I fall off? The dog caught me by surprise, and ran right up barking. My first reaction was to veer out of the way, and due to the nature of the terrain, I ended up coming off the bike.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I had my headphones in at the time, listening to some tunes to help get me through the day, and hadn't heard the dog approaching.</p>
<p>Lesson learned &#8211; Don't wear <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/best-headphones-for-cycling/">headphones when cycling</a> in dog country!</p>
<h2>Potential Accidents when cycling</h2>
<p>Most of the potential accidents that aggressive dogs might cause when on a <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/travel-the-world.html/">bicycle tour</a>, are when you feel forced to veer further into the road.</p>
<p>This occurs when a dog starts running at you from land or property on the same side of the road that you are cycling. It's a natural reaction to want to pull over into the middle of the road to create more space between you and the dog.</p>
<p>Try to avoid this whenever possible though. The traffic behind you may be unaware of what you are doing, and you might get hit from behind.</p>
<p>The reverse also occasionally occurs, where a dog will run at you from the opposite side of the road to which you are cycling on. Its happened to me a few times, and in one case, a dog ran across oncoming traffic to start barking at me.</p>
<p>The reaction here, is to veer out onto the shoulder if there is one, the embankment, or off the road completely.</p>
<p>Try to avoid this as well, as you don't want to &#8216;ditch' your bike, especially if you face a tumble down a mountainside in the back of beyond!</p>
<figure id="attachment_4317" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4317" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4317 size-full" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/elephant.jpg" alt="If you think aggressive dogs are a problem, don't even get me started on elephants!" width="400" height="267" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/elephant.jpg 400w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/elephant-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4317" class="wp-caption-text">If you think aggressive dogs are a problem, don't even get me started on elephants!</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Other ways aggressive dogs can cause accidents</h2>
<p>A rarer way in which aggressive dogs might cause you to have an accident when cycling, is if it should somehow get under your wheels. If this happens, its pretty unlikely that you are going to be able to stay on the bike.</p>
<p>Again, you are faced with injury from the fall, and potential injury from traffic coming from behind you.</p>
<h2>Avoid Dog Bites When Cycling</h2>
<p>This is what most cyclists are afraid of when confronted by dogs on the road. The last thing you want is a mangy mutt sinking his teeth into you.</p>
<p>Forget the initial blood loss &#8211; With the danger of infection or disease you would need to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Rabies would be a huge concern, especially in less developed parts of the world.</p>
<p>On my last <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/best-time-to-visit-nepal/">hiking trip to Nepal</a>, one of our group got bitten by a guard dog. With no way to be sure, it was off for a dose of rabies shots. Fortunately, he was covered by insurance. The first round of 23 separate injections came to over 2000 dollars!</p>
<p>Hopefully, the following strategies will help you to avoid getting bitten.</p>
<h2>What to do when a dog chases you on a bike &#8211; Strategies</h2>
<p>At this point, you know why some dogs react the way they do, and the dangers that they can present. All it leaves now, is to develop a strategy for dealing with aggressive dogs on a bicycle tour.</p>
<p>There are a few ways in which the dangers that aggressive dogs present can be avoided, and it comes down to minimising momentum and proximity.</p>
<p>Let's look at some ideas on what to do if a dog chases you on a bike.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29561" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cycling-and-dogs.jpg" alt="how to stop a dog from chasing bikes" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cycling-and-dogs.jpg 1280w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cycling-and-dogs-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cycling-and-dogs-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cycling-and-dogs-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<h2>Unclip from the pedals</h2>
<p>If you are wearing cleats or using cages, unclip or get your feet out as soon as you see or hear a dog running towards you. There's nothing worse than coming off a bike when you are still clipped in. Been there, and done that!</p>
<p>It also frees your feet and legs should you need to pull them out of the way of a snapping dogs mouth, or kick out at a dog that has got too close.</p>
<h2>Get off the Bike</h2>
<p>Where practically possible, it is best to get off the bike. This might be counter-intuitive at first, as pure survival instinct will be telling you to put as much distance between the dog and yourself.</p>
<p>You might be able to out-cycle the chasing dog sometimes, but normally, it just encourages the dog to give chase for longer than it would do otherwise.</p>
<p>Getting off the bike stops your momentum, which neutralises the risk of falling off the bike, and minimises the chances of veering off into the road and getting hit by traffic.</p>
<p>By walking with the bike between you and the dog, you also help solve the proximity problem by keeping the dog at bay. At this point, you would need to play it by ear.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the dog will lose interest and trot away. At other times, it may continue in an aggressive manner barking and snapping. Each situation is different, and experience will tell you how to judge it.</p>
<h2>Slow Down when cycling near Dogs</h2>
<p>If it's not possible to get off the bike and push, then at least slow down. This will reduce the chances of serious injury should you fall off, and may enable you to use some of the following ideas.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29562" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dogs-and-bicycles.jpg" alt="best defense against aggressive dogs" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dogs-and-bicycles.jpg 1280w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dogs-and-bicycles-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dogs-and-bicycles-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dogs-and-bicycles-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<h2>Use sticks to keep dogs away</h2>
<p>In some countries, I have chosen to cycle with a dog deterrent stick I picked up from the side of the road.</p>
<p>Now, please don't get all animal rights on me and tell me that its wrong to hit a dog. I know that, and would never hit a dog out of malice.</p>
<p>The stick is used defensively, not aggressively. If I am walking with my bike, or cycling at slow speeds and feel the need to use the stick by making defensive swings, then I will do.</p>
<p>If by any chance I do make contact with a chasing dog, then in my opinion, it was just too damn close. Whenever the choice is there between using a stick to defend myself and getting bitten, the stick wins every time.</p>
<h2>Using Stones to keep dogs away</h2>
<p>In some countries, dogs are so accustomed to the very motion of someone reaching down to pick up a rock to throw, that they will stop chasing and immediately run away. They can also make a good distraction in order to pedal yourself out of the danger zone.</p>
<p>When it comes to how to repel dogs while biking, this is a simple method. Even the hand movement without throwing the stone sometimes works.</p>
<h2>Command Dogs With Your Voice</h2>
<p>Never underestimate the power of your voice when in a conflict situation, and this applies equally to humans as well as aggressive dogs.</p>
<p>Shouting at an aggressor may put them off or make them think twice. Combine that with reaching for a stone or swinging with a stick, and most dogs will back away.</p>
<h2>Water might work keeping dogs away</h2>
<p>Some people claim that squirting a bottle of water in the face of a chasing dog will make them stop in their tracks. I've never tried this myself, because normally, water is quite a precious resource and I don't want to leave myself short.</p>
<p>I've also heard of some people carrying small water pistols. Again, never tied this, but it at least sounds fun even if it doesn't prove to be effective!</p>
<h2>Pepper Spray</h2>
<p>I come from a country where we don't have pepper spray for general sale, so can't really comment. The major drawback I imagine, would be that you might end up spraying your own face, and then cause more problems than you were trying to solve!</p>
<h2>Dog deterrent for cyclists</h2>
<p>There are also a number of products on the market that are said to off protection against aggressive dogs. I've not tried any of these myself, but theoretically they may have some use.</p>
<p>Products and devices that may offer protection from dogs while biking include an air horn dog deterrent, a dog dazer, and animal deterrent sprays.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>There is no one method that will guarantee success when confronted with an aggressive dog, but using a combination of the above should see you good in most circumstances.</p>
<p>Agree or disagree with any of it? Have any other suggestions to make on what to do if dog chases you on bike?</p>

<h2>FAQ About Dogs and Bicycles</h2>
<p>Everybody wants to stay safe and avoid a bite as they ride their bike! Some of the popularly asked questions about how to deal with angry dog behavior while cycling include:</p>
<h3>What to do when a dog chases you on a bicycle?</h3>
<p>You can either try to outpace the dog by riding faster, as after 30 seconds or so most dogs will give up the chase. Alternatively, you can dismount and walk with the bike between you and the dog, or employ a defensive tactic such as spraying water, using an air horn, or throwing stones if the dog attacks.</p>
<h3>Why do dogs chase bikes?</h3>
<p>&#8216;There must be some predatory sequence that kicks in when dogs see cyclists! My theory is that a dog will chase cyclists out of what it considers to be its territory.</p>
<h3>Can a bike outrun a dog?</h3>
<p>Even with a fully loaded touring bicycle you can outrun a dog on flat ground. This might be more difficult if a dog starts chasing after you when cycling uphill though, and you might want to employ a different tactic to deter them.</p>
<h3>Will an air horn scare a dog?</h3>
<p>A horn that is loud might cause enough distraction for the dog to break off the attack, as well as attract attention from passers-by who can assist you.</p>
