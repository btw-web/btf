<p><strong>Bike touring involves long hours in the saddle, so you've got to be kind to your butt! This guide to the best saddles for touring will help you on your quest to find a comfortable bike seat for cycling long distances.</strong></p>

<h2>Best Saddle For Bike Touring</h2>
<p>There is no one size fits all solution to any aspect of bicycle touring, particularly when it comes to choosing a saddle. We're all built differently, have different riding styles, and want different things.</p>
<p>What's comfortable in a bike saddle for me could be a nightmare for you, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Throw into the mix considerations about weight, the ethical uses of leather, and a hundred other factors, and you can see why it's a tough job finding the best touring saddle!</p>

<h2>Men's Cycling Saddles</h2>
<p>A quick note &#8211; Men and women will have different needs when it comes to bicycle seats. At least, I am led to believe so.</p>
<p>I can't pretend to say what type of saddle would be best for women. As I'm a guy, this guide to touring saddles is written from my perspective and experience.<br />
<script type="text/javascript">
amzn_assoc_placement = "adunit0";
amzn_assoc_search_bar = "true";
amzn_assoc_tracking_id = "davstrapag-20";
amzn_assoc_ad_mode = "manual";
amzn_assoc_ad_type = "smart";
amzn_assoc_marketplace = "amazon";
amzn_assoc_region = "US";

</script><br />
<script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US"></script></p>
<p>What I would say, is that each of these saddle manufacturers is likely to have women's ranges of saddles as well, so take a look at them if you wish.</p>
<p>What I would really love though, is feedback from any female cyclists about their opinions on the best saddles for women. Leave a comment at the end of the article!</p>
<h2>Finding the best touring saddle</h2>
<p>I've tried a few myself over the years when <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-england-to-south-africa.html/">cycling from England to Cape Town</a>, and <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-from-alaska-to-argentina-the-pan-american-highway">Alaska to Argentina</a>.</p>
<p>And to be honest, every single one I tried during those trips was literally a pain in the butt!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-27479 aligncenter" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brooks-b17-saddle-for-touring.jpg" alt="Brooks B17 saddle for touring" width="1204" height="903" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brooks-b17-saddle-for-touring.jpg 1204w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brooks-b17-saddle-for-touring-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brooks-b17-saddle-for-touring-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brooks-b17-saddle-for-touring-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brooks-b17-saddle-for-touring-320x240.jpg 320w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brooks-b17-saddle-for-touring-480x360.jpg 480w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brooks-b17-saddle-for-touring-720x540.jpg 720w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brooks-b17-saddle-for-touring-735x551.jpg 735w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p>It was only a few years later that I tried a <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/brooks-b17-saddle.html/">Brooks saddle</a> when <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-across-europe.html">cycling from Greece to England</a>.&nbsp;At that point, I realised I had found the Holy Grail and could stop searching!</p>
<p>As such, my personal recommendation of a good saddle for touring on a bicycle is the <a href="https://amzn.to/2VdaWwM">Brooks B17 Saddle</a>.</p>
<h2>Brooks B17 Saddle For Touring</h2>
<p>The classic Brooks saddle is by far the most popular saddle for bicycle touring. This doesn't mean that everyone rides one though, and one of the reasons for that can be price.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9061 aligncenter" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/stanforth-kibo-brokks-saddle.jpg" alt="Brooks B17 Saddle" width="1032" height="580" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/stanforth-kibo-brokks-saddle.jpg 1032w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/stanforth-kibo-brokks-saddle-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/stanforth-kibo-brokks-saddle-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/stanforth-kibo-brokks-saddle-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1032px) 100vw, 1032px" /></p>
<p>They aren't cheap. Especially when compared to other bike saddles that seem to offer just as many benefits at a fraction of the price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, it was this price issue that put me off of buying a Brooks saddle for so many years. Whey would I spend 50 pounds more on a saddle? That might be an extra 5 days <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/travel-budget.html/">budget on a long distance cycling tour</a>!</p>
<p>Take it from me, that was possibly the dumbest rationalization I've ever made for not buying one earlier. And I've made plenty of dumb rationalizations in my life.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-27480 aligncenter" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brooks-saddle-for-bike-touring.jpg" alt="Brooks saddle for bike touring" width="1124" height="843" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brooks-saddle-for-bike-touring.jpg 1124w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brooks-saddle-for-bike-touring-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brooks-saddle-for-bike-touring-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brooks-saddle-for-bike-touring-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brooks-saddle-for-bike-touring-320x240.jpg 320w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brooks-saddle-for-bike-touring-480x360.jpg 480w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brooks-saddle-for-bike-touring-720x540.jpg 720w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brooks-saddle-for-bike-touring-735x551.jpg 735w" sizes="(max-width: 1124px) 100vw, 1124px" /></p>
<p>After having bought one and then used it for a few weeks, and then months, the comfort was worth every single penny. Probably ten times that every single penny!</p>
<p>My recommendation &#8211; If you are starting out on your journey to find the best bicycle touring saddle, try a Brooks B17 and see how you get on. I for one wished I had done this earlier.</p>

<h2>Brooks Cambium Saddle</h2>
<p>One thing that puts some people off the Brooks saddle is that it is made of leather. If you fall into this category of person, you might prefer to try their <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/brooks-cambium-c17-review">Cambium saddle</a> instead.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-12392 aligncenter" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Brooks-Cambium-C17-Review.jpg" alt="Brooks Cambium C17 Review" width="1008" height="756" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Brooks-Cambium-C17-Review.jpg 1008w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Brooks-Cambium-C17-Review-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Brooks-Cambium-C17-Review-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" /></p>
<p>This has been designed as a long distance touring saddle, but made from vulcanised rubber with a cotton top.</p>
<p>I tried this saddle out for a few months, but didn't really get along with it. I thought it was far inferior to the B17 saddle, and so swapped back.</p>
<p>Still, it's worth a try if you don't want a leather saddle for bike touring.</p>
<p>Available on Amazon: <a href="https://amzn.to/3aQFaw5">Cambium C17 Saddle</a></p>

<h2>Non-Brooks Saddles</h2>
<p>Of course, Brooks aren't the only company who make bike touring saddles. Their are dozens of manufacturers out there to choose from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't honestly say I've tried them all, but I've been through quite a few, including <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/travelogue-update-26-mbeya-to-lilongwe.html">two dollar saddles picked up at street markets in Africa</a>!</p>
<p>As such, I decided to ask some cyclists in a Facebook group which non-Brooks touring saddles they were happy with. Their remarks brought back a mixed bag so to speak. Here's a few of their recommendations:</p>
<h3>Charge Spoon Cycling Saddle</h3>
<p>For anyone that doesn't like a wide saddle such as the Brooks B17, the Charge Spoon is a good choice. It's also pretty wallet friendly, and is made of synthetic leather.<br />
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charge-Spoon-Classic-Bike-Saddle/dp/B07KSGVF4X/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&keywords=charge+spoon&qid=1586258678&sr=8-3&linkCode=li3&tag=davstrapag-20&linkId=b8e1ea4652fe1c55dd0fab24499c619f&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07KSGVF4X&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=davstrapag-20&language=en_US" border="0"></a><img loading="lazy" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=davstrapag-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B07KSGVF4X" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></p>
<p>This is a good saddle for anyone that doesn't want to maintain a leather saddle, and prefers not worrying about what happens when the saddle gets wet. One cyclist mentioned that they felt the synthetic leather top wore out too quickly though.</p>
<p>Available via Amazon: <a href="https://amzn.to/2xacZtE">Charge Spoon Saddle</a></p>
<h3>Selle Italia</h3>
<p>An Italian company with a similarly long heritage as Brooks, Selle Italia make a range of saddle, some of which may be more suited to long distance bike touring than others.</p>
<p>Personally, I find their sheer range a little overwhelming when it comes to choosing which Selle Italia saddle is the best for long distance cycling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out their website: <a href="https://www.selleitalia.com/en/">Selle Italia</a></p>
<h3>Selle Anatomica</h3>
<p>This US saddle brand was also mentioned by a couple of cyclists. Like many manufacturers, they have a variety of bicycle saddles made of different materials, some of which may be more suited to bike touring than others.</p>
<p>I've personally never gone for the cut-out type saddle these guys seem to specialize in, but they might be a good choice for men with prostate issues.</p>
<p>Check out their website: <a href="https://selleanatomica.com/">Selle Anatomica</a></p>
<h3>More saddles for bike touring</h3>
<p>In addition to the bike seats mentioned above, you might want to spend some time researching these other saddles which may be suitable for touring:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/39QUSGu">Fizik Saddles</a> &#8211; The company ethos seems to be geared toward performance than bike touring, but you may find a bike seat for long distance cycle trips in their catalogue. The Aliante range seems most suited.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3bULvab">Prologo Zero II</a> &#8211; Perhaps more suited to road cycling, but certainly an option worth considering.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2xVaMlM">SDG Belair</a> &#8211; A bike saddle that is popular in MTB circles, it may also be comfortable seat for longer bicycle rides.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2xYhLdz">Selle SMP Pro</a> &#8211; World record setting cyclist Mark Beaumont uses these (or did at least once). He's not your average cyclist though!</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3bYZc88">Tioga Spyder</a>&nbsp; &#8211; A series of crazy looking designs that resemble spider's webs. Does this make them comfortable bike saddles though?</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-27482 aligncenter" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Best-Saddles-for-Bike-Touring.jpg" alt="The Best Saddles for Bike Touring reviewed" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Best-Saddles-for-Bike-Touring.jpg 1000w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Best-Saddles-for-Bike-Touring-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Best-Saddles-for-Bike-Touring-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Best-Saddles-for-Bike-Touring-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Best-Saddles-for-Bike-Touring-735x1103.jpg 735w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2 class="ql-align-center">Riding Style and Body Position</h2>
<p class="ql-align-center">Before signing off, here's some final thoughts on riding position and the effect of long rides.</p>
<p class="ql-align-center">Everyone has an individual riding style, although it must be said that most bike tourers set themselves up for comfort over speed. Or at least, it makes sense to do that!</p>
<p class="ql-align-center">Bicycle tourists should keep in mind that body position, width of the sit bones and flexibility of the lower back will all play a part in what the best saddle width and shape is for you.</p>
<p class="ql-align-center">Bicycle travellers with a more upright position when they are riding (that's me!) may need a wider saddle and perhaps wear good padded cycling shorts.</p>
<p class="ql-align-center">Aggressive riders who ride in a more sporty position might prefer a firmer saddle to a soft saddle.</p>
<p>In general, when bikepacking, you’ll find yourself sitting on the bicycle saddle for some pretty long rides. 80kms a day doesn't sound a lot, but on day 20, 30,or 40 you'll probably wish for heavier but firmer touring bike saddles over the soft gel type that casual riders prefer.</p>
<h2 class="ql-align-center">Bike Saddle FAQ</h2>
<p class="ql-align-center">When readers are looking for the best touring bike saddles for their next trip, they often have questions similar to:</p>
<h3>What is the best touring saddle?</h3>
<p>When it comes to bicycle touring saddles, the Brooks England B17 is perhaps the most popular due to its solid construction and comfort on long rides.</p>
<h3 class="ql-align-center">How do I choose a touring bike saddle?</h3>
<p class="ql-align-center">We all have different riding positions and requirements when it comes to saddle comfort. One way to choose the right saddle size, is to go into a bike shop and see if they have a sit bones width tool.</p>
<h3>What is sit bone width?</h3>
<p>On average, male sit bone width ranges from 100mm to 140mm (give or take a few mm), while female sit bone width varies from 110mm to 150mm.</p>
<h3>Are carved saddles more comfortable?</h3>
<p class="ql-align-center">If you have a tendency to suffer from soft tissue pain more than sit bones pane, you might find that a carved saddle gives you a more comfortable ride.</p>
