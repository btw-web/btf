<h2>Cycling in Peru &#8211; A Few Travel Tips</h2>
<p>I spent nearly two months bike touring in Peru as part of my <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-from-alaska-to-argentina-the-pan-american-highway">Alaska to Argentina bicycle tour</a>. I found it to be one of my favourite countries when it comes to bicycle touring, and would love to return one day soon!</p>
<p>During my time of biking in Peru, I kept a blog post a day. You can find links to the blog posts at the bottom of this article.</p>
<p>The rough route took me from the border with Ecuador, through the mountainous areas, and on to <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/bike-touring-in-bolivia/">Bolivia</a>. You can see a map which shows more or less the route I took below.</p>
<h2>Tips for planning a bike tour in Peru</h2>
<p>After completing my trip, I received a couple of emails from people looking for travel tips on cycling in Peru, I decided to put together the answers here in one place.</p>
<p>These travel tips on cycling in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru">Peru</a> cover most of the commonly asked questions. Links to my bike touring blog posts follow on at the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this information proves useful for planning your own bike tour in Peru!</p>

<h3><strong>1. Is Peru A Safe Country To Visit? What risk is there from bandits and other criminals?</strong></h3>
<p>Everyone has their own experiences, but I felt Peru to be a very safe country. Touring on a bicycle will immediately make you somewhat of a novelty with the locals of course, but&nbsp;there were no particular dangers.</p>
<p>That said, there is one area that most cyclists will avoid, and that is Paijan in the north of Peru. Tales of robbery are not just limited to bicycles – Tourists travelling on bus and car here also get robbed. Best avoided I think!</p>
<p>For general road cycling safety tips, take a look at this article &#8211; <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-tips-road-safety">cycling tips for staying safe on a bike tour</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>2. What accommodation do you recommend? Normally we camp but are unsure how safe that will be when cycling in Peru, and how many campsites are there?</strong></h3>
<p>Almost every village or town has accommodation of some description, and most of it will cost less than 10 dollars a night. Of course, you shouldn’t expect too much for this!</p>
<p>A room with a bed that you would probably prefer to lay your sleeping bag on is the norm out in the sticks, but the tourist centres have better quality accommodation.</p>
<p>Camping (<a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/component/content/article/125-bicycle-touring-tips/922-how-to-wild-camp-when-bicycle-touring-around-the-word.html">wild camping</a>) is more than possible throughout the country, and I did it on many an occasion. It's very easy up in the mountains, but of course, it will get cold at night! On more than one occasion, the water in my water bottles froze when I left them on the bike – bring them into the tent is my hint here!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1699 size-full aligncenter" title="Cycling in Peru" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wild-camp-2.jpeg" alt="Cycling in Peru" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wild-camp-2.jpeg 400w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wild-camp-2-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><br />
<em>Wild Camping in Peru &#8211; Sometimes I didn't bother with a tent!</em></p>
<h3><strong>3. How bad are the mosquitoes?</strong></h3>
<p>I didn't really notice them that much when cycling in Peru, although they are present in the lower areas. It really is going to depend on which parts of Peru you are going to travel through.</p>
<p>Up in the mountains, you won't find any mossies, but you may encounter biting flies of other types. Overall, not much of a concern. Insect repellent might not be a bad idea, as is covering up at dawn and dusk when they tend to bite the worst.</p>
<h3><strong>4. What is the quality of the roads and what are the drivers like?</strong></h3>
<p>Road quality can be quite variable. The main roads are normally in pretty good condition, but they are not so much fun to cycle on with the traffic etc. In addition, where a main road is poorly maintained, it is harder to cycle on than if one took a minor dirt road.</p>
<p>The minor roads I will call “dirt roads”, but these can very from quite literally dirt, to small gravel type stones. These are far more fun to cycle on, the traffic is less heavy, and there is certainly more of a sense of adventure.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2275 size-full" title="Cycling in Peru on Dirt Roads" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/planet-scape.jpeg" alt="cycling in Peru" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/planet-scape.jpeg 400w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/planet-scape-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><br />
<em>Some of the dirt roads when cycling in Peru were simply stunning!</em><br />
<em> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2274 size-full" title="Spectacular Views When Cycling in Peru" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/safety-track.jpeg" alt="cycling in Peru" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/safety-track.jpeg 400w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/safety-track-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></em><br />
<em>Admittedly, safety barriers are in short supply on the dirt roads in Peru!</em></p>
<h3><strong>5.&nbsp; Anything else we need to know?</strong></h3>
<p>A few things that I would mention are</p>
<p><strong>Speak some Spanish</strong> – You will be lucky to find anyone outside the tourist centres that speaks English&#8230; In fact, you will be lucky in some of the more remote villages if the people speak Spanish!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/700c-vs-26-inch-wheels"><strong>700c wheels are a rarity</strong></a>. If you are cycling in Peru with these, make sure you have all the inner tubes, spokes and spare tyres you think you might need. Take spare brake pads as well – Those long downhill descents will soon wear through them! This is hard-core bicycle touring at its finest!</p>
<p><strong>Guinea Pig</strong> – If you are going to try it, do it in a small village and pay a dollar or so as opposed to 15 dollars in a tourist hotspot. You'll probably just have it the once anyway! I've tried it a couple of times, and wasn't particularly impressed.</p>
<p><strong>Cash</strong> – Keep enough on you to last between cities. Small towns wont have an ATM machine.</p>
<p><strong>Peru</strong> &#8211; Is a lot bigger than you might at first think.</p>
