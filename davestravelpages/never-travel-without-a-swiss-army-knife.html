<h1>Swiss Army Knife &#8211; Never Travel Without One</h1>
<p><strong>Whether backpacking or cycling around the world, the one thing that I would suggest is to never travel without a Swiss Army Knife. Here's a look at one of them.</strong></p>
<h2>Swiss Army Knife For Travel</h2>
<p>These versatile little bits of kit fit easily into a pocket, weigh next to nothing, and yet have a multitude of uses. There are a lot of cheap imitations around, but the genuine article is made by Victorinox, who offer a lifetime guarantee on the materials and workmanship.</p>
<p>I have owned several of their knives, but alas, I am not the best at keeping them well oiled and in optimum working order, so from time to time, I need to buy a new one</p>
<figure id="attachment_3959" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3959" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3959 size-full" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/swiss-army-knife1.jpeg" alt="Swiss Army Knife" width="300" height="168"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3959" class="wp-caption-text">Never travel without a Swiss Army Knife</figcaption></figure>
<p>I have a &#8220;gear I need to buy&#8221; list on my laptop, but as my next cycling expedition around the world is not due to begin for a year or two yet, I can pick and choose the best moments to buy each piece of kit.</p>
<p>The moment to buy this Swiss Army Knife came when Tesco's were offering to double up their reward vouchers on certain departments, and one of those was camping.</p>
<p>Due to the fact I had purchased my expedition bicycle on a Tesco credit card, and had earned reward points through that, I had 20 quids worth of vouchers.</p>
<p>Doubling this up meant that I had 40 pounds to spend in the camping department, and so I bought this Swiss Army Knife and a few bits for the bike.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Choosing a Swiss Army Knife</h2>
<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Victorinox Swiss Army Knife I decided on is the Ranger version, which cost 30 pounds (even that was a reduced price &#8211; i really landed on my feet here!). As you can tell from the photo, it has all sorts of appendages that can perform different functions, and whilst I carry various knives and other tools on my cycling expeditions around the world, this acts as a great supplement to them. Below, i will list some of the things i find most useful about the Victorinox Ranger Swiss Army Knife</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Scissors &#8211; My toe nails are tough. REALLY tough! The Swiss Army Knife has a great pair of scissors that cut through them with no problems at all!</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Main Blade &#8211; When on the road, I use this for slicing cheese, peeling spuds, dicing carrots and more.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bottle Opener &#8211; Its pretty well known that I enjoy a beer!</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Corkscrew &#8211; Its also pretty well known that I enjoy a bottle of wine!</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Can Opener &#8211; This sees a lot of action, as I love eating tuna with pasta on my cycling trips.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Wood Saw &#8211; Occasional use when there is a camp fire, although in some countries I carry a machete for this purpose and to clear a campsite for my tent.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>File &#8211; It doesn't get much use as a nail file, but occasionally sees actions as a metal file when things go wrong with the bike or other gear.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Various screwdrivers &#8211; I carry a mutli-tool for the bike, but the Swiss Army Knife acts as a great back up.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All in all, when it comes to value for money, and overall usage, it doesn't get much better than this. Never travel without a Swiss Army Knife!</div>
