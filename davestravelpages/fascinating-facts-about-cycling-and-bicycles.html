<p>Dave has cycled around most of the world, including long distance bike tours such as <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-from-alaska-to-argentina-the-pan-american-highway">riding from Alaska to Argentina</a>, and <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-england-to-south-africa.html/">cycling from England to South Africa</a>. Now living in Greece and working as a <a href="http://amazon.com/author/davebriggs">travel writer</a> Dave has a somewhat ambitious goal of visiting every Greek island (there's over 200!) and writing about them all.</p>
