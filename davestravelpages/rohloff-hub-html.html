<h1>Rohloff Hub &#8211; Touring Bikes with Rohloff Speedhub Explained</h1>
<p><strong>I've been asked quite a few times why I decided to choose a Rohloff hub for bicycle touring. After all, they are pretty expensive and not easily repaired if something goes wrong. Here's why I made up my mind to buy one, and why I think it's worth the investment.</strong></p>
<h2>Rohloff Hub for Touring Bikes</h2>
<p>Why did you buy a Rohloff-equipped touring bike, aren't they expensive?</p>
<p>I get this quite often. Sometimes, it is from other cyclists who are considering buying one themselves. Other times, it's from non-cyclists who can't quite believe that I spent that much on it!</p>
<div class="mv-video-target mv-video-id-ng8rxiae40y58dkmaklx" data-video-id="ng8rxiae40y58dkmaklx" data-volume="70"></div>Believe me, it was not a snap decision. I spent a long while weighing up the pros and cons of choosing a Rohloff hub for my expedition bicycle before parting with my hard earned cash.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4360 size-large" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Rohloff-Hub-1024x576.jpg" alt="Rohloff Hub" width="1024" height="576"></p>
<h2>Using a Rohloff Hub</h2>
<p>Before we go any further, I need to mention that I've not always used a Rohloff hub. My previous journeys such as <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-england-to-south-africa.html/">cycling from England to South Africa</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-from-alaska-to-argentina-the-pan-american-highway">cycling from Alaska to Argentina</a> were undertaken on bicycles with traditional rear derailleur systems.</p>
<p>They did the job, but I started to appreciate the benefits that a Rohloff hub might offer. Of course, benefits are one thing. Being in a position to buy one is another matter entirely!</p>

<h2>Deciding to buy a Rohloff Speedhub</h2>
<p>Returning to England from Argentina in 2011, I began to plan my next trip differently.</p>
<p>Usually, I would work and save &nbsp;from between eight months and a year, and then travel for a year or so until the money ran out. &nbsp;This time though, I wanted my next adventure to be a complete <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/travel-the-world.html/">cycling trip around the world</a>.</p>
<p>As it might take anywhere between four and six years to complete, I would have to work and save a lot longer than usual beforehand.</p>
<p>During this time, I would also re-equip myself with all the gear I would need. This included a new expedition bike, and I decided that I would opt for one with a Rohloff hub.</p>

<h2>Why Choose a Rohloff Hub for Bicycle Touring</h2>
<p><strong>What is a Rohloff Hub?</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohloff_Speedhub">Rohloff</a> internally geared hub has been on the market since 1998, and features 14 gears. Unlike derailleur gears, there is no overlapping. Each one is spaced out equally, is unique and usable, and is changed by a single grip twist shifter. The chain does not need to move in order to alter gears, which means that gear changing can be done whilst stationary.</p>
<p>There are also no exposed components which might be damaged on rough tracks. This means that the Rohloff hub is popular with mountain bikers as well as bicycle tourists, who appreciate its deceptive simplicity and build quality.</p>
<p>Rohloff are proud of the fact that they have not known the internals of a hub fail. Other general problems are few and far between. There is probably no better example of German engineering excellence for bicycles than the Rohloff hub!</p>

<h2>Reasons to Choose a Rohloff Hub for Bicycle Touring</h2>
<p><strong>No vulnerable outer parts</strong> &#8211; As all the moving components are in the sealed unit, the speedhub is more robust than a derailleur system. This makes it far more suitable for bikepacking and touring, where the bicycle may be ridden over challenging terrain.</p>
<p><strong>Low Maintenance</strong> &#8211; Apart from changing the oil every 5000 kms (or every year if the distance isn't met), no other maintenance is required.</p>
<p><strong>Easy to change gear</strong> &#8211; One of the things that I find most appealing with the Rohloff hub, is being able to change gear whilst stationary. On a derailleur equipped bike, there is nothing &nbsp;more annoying than being brought to an abrupt halt in traffic or on steep hills, and finding yourself in totally the wrong gear. To put it in the right one, involves either physical strain, or getting off the bike and pushing for a bit as the gears change. With the Rohloff, you just use the gripshift to literally fly through the gears.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Running Costs</strong> &#8211; All of the above means that the overall running costs using a speedhub will be lower when averaged out over several years. This is something that is very appealing to anyone setting out on a multi year RTW cycle ride.</p>
<h2>Cons to using a Rohloff Speedhub</h2>
<p>Very few things are perfect in this world, and of course deciding to buy a Rohloff bike does have its drawbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Initial upfront cost</strong> &#8211; Whilst the overall running costs may be lower, buying either the Rohloff bike or Rohloff rear hub does involve a rather large initial upfront cost. When I bought the Thorn Nomad speedhub bike in 2014, the cost of the hub was around 700 pounds. Updating this in 2020, you'll be lucky to get one for under 1000 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Heavier rear wheel</strong> &#8211; The addition of the hub makes the wheel a lot heavier than normal. Overall, when taking into account the drivetrain and hubs, using a Rohloff adds about an extra half kilo in weight.</p>
<p><strong>Not repairable yourself</strong> &#8211; It is a sealed unit, meaning that if you have a problem with the internal hub gears, you'd have to send it back to Rohloff for repairs. A bit inconvenient if you are in the middle of a bike tour!</p>
<p><strong>Shifter</strong> &#8211; The handlebar gear shifter is a bit divisive among certain people. Personally I love it, but to others it may limit their choice of handlebars or feel too flimsy.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts on the Rohloff Hub</h2>
<p>Having used the Rohloff speedhub on my bike now for over five years, I can honestly say that I am very happy with it. It's one of those bits of gear that has a higher upfront cost, but repays itself over the long run.</p>
<p>More importantly, it gives piece of mind. When you are on the bike for 8 hours a day, day in and day out, having confidence that the bike you are riding will not let you down leaves you to enjoy the simple things, which is really what bike touring is all about.</p>

<h2>Rohloff Hubs FAQ</h2>

<h3>Are internal gear hubs any good?</h3>
<p>An internal gear hub, such as the Rohloff, allows you to shift gears even when stationary. This is a big bonus when bike touring on inclines with heavy loads. while you're not pedaling. The Rohloff internal hub is very low maintenance, only requiring an oil change at set intervals.</p>
<h3>How much does a Rohloff hub weigh?</h3>
<p>When weighing the Rohloff Speedhub 500/14, you should take into account reduced rate of rings and chain length needed with derailleurs. The fitted Rohloff system with changers and cables weighs in at around 1800 g. This is approximately 300 g more than a comparable derailleur system.</p>
