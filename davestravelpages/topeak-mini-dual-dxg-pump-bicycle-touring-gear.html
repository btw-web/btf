<h2>Choosing a bicycle pump for Bike Touring</h2>
<p>Choosing a good pump for bicycle touring like the Topeak Mini Dual DXG Pump, is perhaps one of the smartest things you will do when preparing for a <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/bicycle-touring-tips">long distance cycling trip</a>.</p>
<p>Even the <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/best-bike-touring-tires/">best bike touring tires</a> end up losing pressure after a few days ride, and keeping them inflated to a good pressure should be a daily task.</p>
<p>A suitable pump needs to be well made, durable, up to the job, lightweight, and not too bulky. Ideally, it should also have a pressure gauge, so that tyres can be inflated to the correct pressures.</p>
<p>Enter the <strong>Topeak Mini Dual DXG pump</strong> then. A compact and affordable bicycle pump that has been around for a few years, showing that if something is well designed from the outset,there is no need to keep altering it every 12 months.</p>

<h2>Topeak Mini Dual DXG Pump Review</h2>
<p>At first glance, the <em>Topeak Mini Dual DXG Pump</em> is a deceptively simple piece of gear. After all, a bicycle pump really only has to do one thing, and that's put air into an inner tube!</p>
<p>However, on closer inspection, it has three design aspects which make this pump perfect for bicycle touring.</p>
<p>Firstly, it weighs only 170g which is practically nothing in the grander scheme of things.</p>
<p>Secondly, it has an &#8216;all valve solution', which means it can inflate inner tubes with both <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/presta-valves-and-schrader-valves.html">Schrader and Presta valves</a> without the need to change any adapters.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it inflates inner tubes both on the pull and the push actions, and finally, it has a pressure gauge.</p>
<h2>Bike Pump With Pressure Gauge</h2>
<p>In fact, the pressure gauge is one of the main reasons that I bought this pump in the first place.</p>
<p>For far too long (make that 25,000 kms of bicycle touring), I have never used a pump with pressure gauge. My theory when it came to inflating tyres, was that when the tyre was solid enough, I would stop pumping.</p>
<p>The pressure gauge on the Topeak Mini Dual DXG pump takes all the guess work out of it now. On my current bike, I am running Schwalbe Marathon tyres, which say that the minimum inflation level should be 3 bar, and the maximum 5 bar.</p>
<p>It's pretty apparent after using the pump a few times, that I have been under-inflating my tyres for years! Whoops! As a side note, inflating the tyres to 4 bar gives me the best results at the moment.</p>
<p>There's not a lot more to say about the Topeak Mini Dual DXG pump really. At just over £16.00 when I bought it, it offers good value for money, and does what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>If it's like any of the other Topeak pumps that I have owned, it will keep on going strong for years. It also has a spare O-ring supplied should one need to be replaced.</p>
<p>It's definitely a nine, if not a ten out of ten in my book, and if you would like to buy one yourself from Amazon, then please follow this link &#8211; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004BUBGZ8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B004BUBGZ8&linkCode=as2&tag=davestravelpa-21&linkId=WQPECSKLPKSA5BZC">Topeak Dual DXG Mini Pump with Smart Head and In-Line Gauge &#8211; Black/Silver</a><img loading="lazy" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=davestravelpa-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B004BUBGZ8" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"></p>
