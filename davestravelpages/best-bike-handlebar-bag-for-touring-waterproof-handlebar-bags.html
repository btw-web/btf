<h2>Buying a new bicycle handlebar bag</h2>
<p>After completing my most recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHNcH8-RIsnV2_2wpbGWJCuWnV_a9uEeK">bike tour in central Greece</a>, I decided it was time to invest in a new handlebar bag.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-9059 size-full" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/stanforth-kibo-.jpg" alt="The Stanforth Kibo+ Expedition Bicycle - Handbuilt in the UK" width="1032" height="580" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/stanforth-kibo-.jpg 1032w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/stanforth-kibo--320x180.jpg 320w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/stanforth-kibo--480x270.jpg 480w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/stanforth-kibo--720x405.jpg 720w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/stanforth-kibo--735x413.jpg 735w" sizes="(max-width: 1032px) 100vw, 1032px" /></p>
<p>For a few years now, I've been rocking the Ortlieb Ultimate 5 compact handlebar bag, and even though I used it successfully when <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-across-europe.html">cycling from Greece to England</a>, I knew this mini handlebar bag had its limitations.</p>
<div class="mv-video-target mv-video-id-qph5zq5folpyy0aq9hab" data-video-id="qph5zq5folpyy0aq9hab" data-volume="70"></div>Although it's completely waterproof, and has given me zero issues, its limitations lay in the size. It's just not big enough (story of my life really haha).</p>
<p>I wanted to be able to fit just a little more inside the small handlebar bag , such as perhaps a camera, cell phone, more day snacks, maps and powerbanks.</p>

<h2>Choosing the best handlebar bag for touring</h2>
<p>I'd been eyeing up the Ortlieb Ultimate 6 classic handlebar bag for sometime, but rather than rush in and buy one, decided to compare 10 handlebar bags suitable for bike touring.</p>
<p>It became apparent that a few things had changed in the bike touring world since I last looked at handlebar bags, so I decided to write this guide to choosing a handle bar bag to help others in the same position.</p>
<p>I'll explain the different sort of handlebar bags available, what I am personally looking for in a handlebar bag, and go through the pros and cons of each of the 10 best handlebar bags for touring I've found.</p>
<p>First though, let's see what has changed in the bike touring world&#8230;</p>
<h2>Bikepacking</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15593" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bikepacking-setup.jpg" alt="A bikepacking setup with front handlebar roll bag" width="1000" height="750" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bikepacking-setup.jpg 1000w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bikepacking-setup-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bikepacking-setup-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>10 years ago, people were experimenting with making their own frame bags. A few small manufacturers were releasing items, but the concept was very much niche.</p>
<p>Roll forward to 2018, and the bikepacking industry has exploded.</p>
<p>Bikepacking is really a complete subject of its own that I want to write about in the future. For now though, I'll just limit my thoughts as to how bikepacking has directly affected the type of handlebar bags on offer for bike touring.</p>
<h2>Bikepacking Bike Front Bag</h2>
<p>Most bikepacking setups do not use a handlebar bag. Instead, they use a waterproof roll bag which most commonly contains a sleeping bag, tent, or tarp.</p>
<p><em>I'm definitely not looking for something like this, so I've discounted these from my 10 best handlebar bags for touring.</em></p>
<p>I have noticed though, that bikepacking has affected the way that some manufacturers have approached designing their handlebar bags. Cylindrical handlebar bags are starting to break onto the scene, and roll-top multi-purpose handle bar bags are also emerging.</p>
<p>Personally, neither of these two developments in bike handlebar bag design do anything for me. I'm far more interested in the day to day practical aspect of using the handle bar bag and how long it will last than the latest trend.</p>
<h2>What I'm looking for in a bike handlebar bag</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/mexican-around-the-world-by-bicycle"><em>A typical bike touring set up by Mexican on a Bike</em></a></p>
<p>So, what is it I'm looking for in a handlebar bag then?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, it's got to be waterproof. That's a no-brainer.</li>
<li>I prefer simple yet sturdy designs.</li>
<li>It has to be easily detachable with a quick release so I can take it with me when parking the bike.</li>
<li>I want to keep my daily snacks and other items and accessories I use when actually cycling in it.</li>
<li>The handlebar bag should be long lasting.</li>
<li>It should have a proven track record.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll be upfront with you now &#8211; the answer really is Ortlieb! Still, it was fun looking at the other types of handlebar bag available online.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I've been hearing great things about Arkel bags. I couldn't find them on Amazon, hence they are not listed below.</p>
<h2>10 best handlebar bags for bike touring</h2>
<p>Here then are 10 of the best bike touring handlebar bags. I've listed them in an order from what I consider to be the best downward. As always I'd love to hear from you, so feel free to leave a comment at the bottom of the article!</p>

<h2>Ortlieb Ultimate6 M Classic Handlebar Bag</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ortlieb-Ultimate6-Classic-Handlebar-Bag/dp/B06X19R3RZ/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1538636615&sr=8-2&keywords=ortlieb+handlebar&linkCode=li3&tag=davstrapag-20&linkId=9c27997f6834c9bbd47bddb2fb57a913&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignleft" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B06X19R3RZ&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=davstrapag-20&language=en_US" border="0"></a><img loading="lazy" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=davstrapag-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B06X19R3RZ" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"><br />
For cyclists outside of the USA, Ortlieb is the number one choice for bike touring bags. This German company produces hard-wearing, incredibly waterproof products that last for years and years.</p>
<p>When it comes to handlebar bags, the Ortlieb Ultimate 6 is their number one offering. This bar bag does come in two sizes which are Medium and Large, but most people find that the medium bicycle front bag is more than adequate for their needs.</p>
<p>Unlike some bags, this is a waterproof handlebar bag due to the materials it is made of. So, no need for additional rain covers. There's also a detachable shoulder strap, so when you do take it from the bike, you can hang it over your shoulder. Useful for going into shops!</p>
<p>The Ultimate6 handlebar bag is compatible with several other systems from Ortlieb, meaning that you can attach map cases and mobile phone holders.</p>
<p>The large storage capacity, and the tried and tested design which has fundamentally changed little over the last 10 or even 20 years makes the Ortlieb one of the best bicycle handlebar bags on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ortlieb-Travel-Ultimate-Classic-Sacoche/dp/B009VKQH9I/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1538639636&sr=8-2&keywords=ortlieb+handlebar+ultimate&linkCode=li3&tag=davstrapag-20&linkId=f6832a8bb0b0a17f1c0f049c7165ccfd&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignright" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B009VKQH9I&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=davstrapag-20&language=en_US" border="0"></a><img loading="lazy" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=davstrapag-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B009VKQH9I" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0">I've personally used Ortlieb bike touring products for many years such as the <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/bicycle-panniers-ortlieb-back-roller-classic-html.html">Ortlieb Back Roller Classic Panniers</a>, and have no complaints. Balance out their slightly more expensive nature against how many years they will last, and you'll end up with a bike handlebar bag that offers great value for money.</p>

<h2>Vaude Road I bike handlebar bag</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vaude-Road-handlebar-green-black/dp/B00751HYTW/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1538641205&sr=8-4&keywords=bicycle+handlebar+bag+vaude&linkCode=li3&tag=davstrapag-20&linkId=4586de81d3e1caa887643b516127dd37&language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignleft" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00751HYTW&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=davstrapag-20&language=en_US" border="0"></a><img loading="lazy" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=davstrapag-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B00751HYTW" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0"><br />
Vaude are another European outdoor brand which have a range of bike touring products to choose from. Their Vaude Road 1 Bike Handlebar bag is worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>A classic look and lightweight, the Vaude handlebar bag is available in several different colours, and like the Ortlieb this bag features a carry strap so you can take it with you when locking the bike up.</p>
<p>In my opinion, despite the easy access the real let-down with the Vaude bar bag is that the materials it is made of are not waterproof. Instead, additional rain covers (provided) need to be put on.</p>
<p>Still, the Vaude is a well respected brand, hard-wearing, and normally comes in a little cheaper than the Ortlieb bags.</p>

<h2>Brooks Isle of Skye Handlebar Bag</h2>

Brooks of England are most famous for their bicycle saddles such as the <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/brooks-b17-saddle.html/">classic Brooks B17 saddle</a> and the <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/brooks-cambium-c17-review">Cambium C17 saddle</a>. They do make a range of other items suitable for bike touring though, one of those being the Isle of Skye Handlebar bag.</p>
<p>Now I'll be honest and say that this handlebar bag from Brooks has something of a hipster feel to it. Is this really the best bike handlebar bag for long distance bike touring?</p>
<p>The phrases &#8216;water resistant' are used instead of waterproof, and somewhat remarkably it weighs even more than the Ortlieb handlebar bag &#8211; Quite a feat!</p>
<p>Still, this bicycle handlebar bag might appeal to those looking for a more stylised look to their bike touring equipment.</p>

It seems you can't get away from this Ibera handlebar bag when looking on Amazon! Touted as a bicycle handlebar camera bag it seems to tick all the boxes for people looking for a bar bag for their camera gear.</p>
<p>Or does it? Again, the material is only water-resistant and the bag is supplied with a rain cover. Would you really want to risk your DSLR camera in a handlebar bag that may absorb water rather than repel it? Something to consider.</p>
<p>The price point is very attractive though, making it a nice entry-level handlebar bag for touring. If you are more of a fair-weather cyclist and are looking for a way to take your camera equipment with you on short bike tours, perhaps the Ibera bike handlebar camera bag appeals to you.</p>

<p>Designed to be a bag you can attach to your bike, and then easily remove and take with you when you reach your destination, it's probably aimed more for day riders, commuters, and weekend cyclists.</p>
<p>With that said, Thule are a respectable brand who do make quality products. In terms of bike touring though, I think the roll-top is a bit of a let down. Given the pricing points for the Thule handlebar bag and the Ortlieb are similar, I'd probably want to stick with Ortlieb.</p>

They have several offerings when it comes to bike handlebar bags, with the best being their Tourguide Handlebar bag.</p>
<p>Visually, I'm sure this will appeal to people who like to see lots of exterior pockets on things. Already, you can imagine which essential items you will be keeping in which compartments of the Tourguide handle bar bag.</p>
<p>On a practical level however, I've found that more pockets with zips is not necessarily a good thing. There's more zips to break, more places for crumbs and rubbish to accumulate, and inevitably some compartments will be impractical.</p>
<p>For me, the main issue is again the rain cover. Once cycle handlebar bags like this get wet (and it will despite the rain covers) they're never quite the same after. It might last a year or two, but lacks the longevity of the Ortlieb front handlebar bags.</p>

Perhaps they sell mainly through other stores or sites?</p>
<p>I've owned a number of Altura products through the years, and whilst I think they offer good value for money, my feeling is they are a notch below Ortlieb products.</p>
<p>Still, this waterproof bike handlebar bag does seem to tick all the boxes from what I can see, although the absence of reviews does puzzle me. There are also no product dimensions from what I can see.</p>

This is their offering for more traditional bags for the handlebar.</p>
<p>For the price, it seems to punch above its weight. They claim it is 100% waterproof, with high strength tear resistant 600D nylon + waterproof TPU film. Its roll down top does not allow for immediate and easy access, but it will keep things dry.</p>
<p>I think this is a rather basic design, and using it on a multi-day ultra-distance bike tour might show that it is more annoying than useful. Still, its fixing system does make it an option if you are considering touring on your road bike, and it is lightweight.</p>

It's two compartments mean that you could separate food and <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/electronic-gear-to-take-on-a-bicycle-tour/">electronic items</a>, and the price is very appealing.</p>
<p>The one drawback &#8211; and it's a major one &#8211; is that this cycling front bag is not waterproof. It's also unclear as to if it is supplied with rain covers.</p>
<p>So, it might be a suitable product for casual cyclists and fair-weather bike touring, but certainly not up to the rigours of the road during a long distance bicycle tour where a guaranteed dry bag is preferred.</p>

<p>In all fairness, this seems to be a very versatile bike. It can switch from being a bike front bag to a top tube bag to a shoulder bag very easily. With this in mind, it might appeal more to the bikepacking enthusiast out there.</p>
<p>For me, the real downside is that it doesn't appear to be easy to access your day to day items. I'm not entirely convinced by the fixing system either. Still, the manufacturers do claim that it is a waterproof front bag for a bike.</p>

<h2>Bike Handlebar bags FAQ</h2>
<p>Thinking of getting new bike bags for your handlebars? Here's some questions that other cyclists often ask:</p>
<h3>What is the best bicycle bag?</h3>
<p>Ortlieb offer a great range of waterproof bags and panniers for bike touring, including bike handlebar bags.</p>
<h3>What is a handlebar bag?</h3>
<p>Bar bags attach to the handlebars and act as a convenient location for storing items such as a map, snacks, or your phone while cycling. This is a really useful feature, whether you're going on a long bike trip or just heading into town to shop.</p>
<h3>What do you keep in your handlebar bag?</h3>
<p>Bike handlebar bags are a very useful place to keep items you may use on a regular basis during long rides on a bicycle tour. Bike tools, snacks, phones, and even spare clothing can be carried in a bikepacking handlebar bag.</p>
<h3>Do handlebar bags affect handling?</h3>
<p>The bicycle's handling is not affected by a handlebar bag. The bag itself would weigh only 1.5kg, and it is unlikely to be filled with anything that weighed more than 2kgs.</p>
<h3>Should a good handlebar bag be waterproof?</h3>
<p>Just like any other bags you use for bicycle touring, the best handlebar bag should be waterproof. Most handlebar bags of a high quality will be made out of a waterproof material. A cheap handlebar bag may come with sperate rain covers.</p>
