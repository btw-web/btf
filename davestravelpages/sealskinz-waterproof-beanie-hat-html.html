<h1>Sealskinz Waterproof Beanie Review: A look at the Sealskinz Waterproof Beanie Hat</h1>
<p><strong>Let's take a look at the Sealskinz waterproof beanie hat. I've owned a couple, using them on several cycling trips now all over the world. Here's my review after using them for a few years.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3789 size-large" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sealskinz-hat-1024x576.jpg" alt="Sealskinz Hat Review - These waterproof beanie hats are excellent for cycling in the rain and during the winter months" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sealskinz-hat-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sealskinz-hat-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>The Sealskinz Waterproof Beanie Hat</h2>
<p>The <strong>Sealskinz beanie hat</strong> has to be one of the best purchases I have made in a long while, and it's been a great addition to my cycling gear.</p>
<p>I've owned a couple over the years. The first one was this orange waterproof knit hat you see in this photo. Now, I own a black <strong>Sealskinz waterproof beanie</strong>. So yes, they do come in different colours!</p>
<h2>Using the Sealskinz Beanie</h2>
<p>I've used the <em>waterproof cycling beanie</em>&nbsp; commuting to work, cycling at the weekends, and on several long distance bicycle tours. I used it several times when <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-from-greece-to-england">cycling from Greece to England</a>, and was glad I had it with me!</p>

<h2>Sealskinz Hat Review</h2>

(A face made for radio)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, you might ask <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/being-bald-is-awesome-when-you-travel">why a man that has no hair needs a waterproof hat</a>, and indeed, that was my own view for many years.</p>
<p>After having worn the <em>Sealskinz beanie</em> throughout winters and when it's raining, it's difficult to see how I got by without one before.</p>
<p>Even without hair, having a warm, dry head on a wet and windy day out on the bike makes all the difference between an enjoyable ride and a miserable one.</p>
<p>If only I had taken the <em>Sealskinz Waterproof Beanie Hat</em> with me to <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-in-canada">Canada</a> when I cycled through there on the way from <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-from-alaska-to-argentina-the-pan-american-highway">Alaska to Argentina</a>!</p>
<h2>Sealskinz Waterproof Beanie Hat Review</h2>
<p>I originally chose the hi-vis orange from the Sealskinz Waterproof Beanie Hat range, as I wanted to make myself as visible as possible to the tin can drivers on the way to and from work.</p>
<p>Believe me when I say, it certainly was hi-viz! (For some reason, probably because I suck at taking photographs, the top picture doesn't show the colour very well.</p>
<p>Look at the photo at the top for a more accurate impression!). Because of the colour, dirt did show up on it a bit though.</p>
<p>There are a range of other colours to choose from, and after I lost the orange one, I replaced it with a <strong>black waterproof cycling beanie</strong>.</p>
<h2>Looking at the Sealskinz Hat</h2>
<p>On picking the hat up, it makes a sort of rustling sound if you move it around your hand. In a way, it sounds like there is lining paper or something similar in the hat.</p>
<p>To a certain extent this is true, as I guess it's the lining making the noise. I thought that this was going to be incredibly irritating if it made this noise when wearing it, but thankfully, it doesn't when its on my head!</p>
<h2>Warm Waterproof Knit Hat</h2>
<p>The inner of the hat has a micro fleece lining, and its this that keeps the head warm. I've used it in reasonably cold weather, and it does make a massive difference.</p>
<p>The Sealskinz Waterproof Beanie Hat is also breathable, which means that moisture doesn't build up inside it to the extent that it might in a regular hat.</p>
<p>Now, I would be lying if I said it was totally breathable &#8211; Nothing ever is. However, because of the fleece lining, the head stays warm regardless, although at the end of a long days ride, the beanie might be a bit wet on the inside.</p>
<h2>How waterproof is the Sealskinz Hat</h2>
<p>The waterproof qualities of the <em>Sealskinz hat</em> are also excellent. I cycled in some pretty torrential rain in England and elsewhere over the years, and they always stand up to the test admirably.</p>
<p>The beanies are also surprisingly windproof, and pull down far enough to cover the ears which is a bonus. Cold ears in a driving wind feels horrible when cycling!</p>
<p>Some people have commented that the hats are perhaps sized a little small. To a certain extent they are, but its because it works best with a snug fit.</p>
<p>It's probably worth keeping in mind if you are thinking of getting one. This snug fit would also allow it to be worn underneath a <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/helmet-for-bicycle-touring.html/">cycling helmet</a>, which again is worth considering.</p>
<h2>Concluding thoughts about the Sealskinz Beanie Hat</h2>
<p>Overall, the&nbsp;<strong>Sealskinz Waterproof Beanie Hat</strong>&nbsp;provides outstanding value for money, and should be a part of every cyclist's kit for those times when the weather turns for the worst.</p>
<p>It's ideal for cycling in wet conditions and helps you stay warm at the same time. It's a great product, and due to it being made from quality premium materials is likely to last for years.</p>
<p>It always accompanies me now on my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/bike-tours-around-the-world-dave-briggs-bicycle-touring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bike tours</a>, and will do for the foreseeable future! Having this hat even for just cold weather conditions without rain is a blessing &#8211; especially if you have no hair like me!</p>
<p>I also have a pair of waterproof socks by the same company that provide the same warmth and comfort in wet weather as the hat. I might do a review of them in the future!</p>
