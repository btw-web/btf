<h1>Reasons to use a Top Tube Phone Bag for Bike Touring</h1>
<p><strong>A top tube phone bag is a neat way to easily use your phone as a navigation device when bike touring. Is it better than a bike phone mount? Let's find out in this guide on reasons to use Top Tube Phone Bags for cycle touring!</strong></p>

<h2>Top Tube Bike Phone Bags</h2>
<p>Bicycle touring is a great way to enjoy the outdoors and see beautiful scenery as you <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/travel-the-world.html/">pedal around the world</a>.</p>
<p>One of the challenges that many bicycle tourers face though, is how to view their phone while biking if they're using it as a GPS.</p>
<p>The solution? A top tube phone bag!</p>
<p>But why would you choose a top tube bag with a phone holder?</p>
<h2>Advantages of a Bike Top Tube Bag for Phones</h2>
<p>The top tube bag provides a stable place to store your phone, and is better than a handlebar or stem phone mount because it is more securely attached.</p>
<p>The bag also gives you a place to store some essentials like snacks and sunscreen under your top tube, so they're accessible while biking without requiring any additional gear!</p>
<p>In my opinion, top tube bags are safer places to keep your phone than a handlebar mount.</p>
<p>With smartphones costing up to 1000 dollars (or more!), the last thing you want is a stone being flipped up by passing traffic and hitting your phone. A bag on the top tube will keep your phone more protected.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33429" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bike-top-tube-bag.jpg" alt="Bike Top Tube Bag with a compartment for a smartphone" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bike-top-tube-bag.jpg 1280w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bike-top-tube-bag-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bike-top-tube-bag-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bike-top-tube-bag-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>I guess you've probably got some questions about using a phone tube bag though such as these ones:</p>
<h2>Are top tube bags heavy?</h2>
<p>Weight is always a concern when bike touring, so a natural thought might be is using a top tube phone bag just going to add more weight.</p>
<p>A top tube bag with phone holder might be slightly heavier than a traditional handlebar or stem mount, but the difference is going to be just a few hundred grams maximum.</p>
<p>In many cases, the top tube bag may weigh just the same as a traditional looking phone mount for a bicycle.</p>
<h2>How does a top tube bag attach to the bicycle?</h2>
<p>A top tube bag is normally attached to the bicycle by three velcro straps. Two of these go around the top tube itself, and one goes around the stem.</p>
<p>This makes it quite stable, and there is little chance of the bag moving or rotating.</p>
<h2>Can you see the phone clearly in a top tube bag?</h2>
<p>Typically, top tube bags with a compartment for a phone have a see-through, touch sensitive plastic shield through which you can see the phone.</p>
<p>This allows you to use the phone as a sat-nav without having it in direct contact with the elements such as direct sun or rain.</p>
<p>The advantage of this is that there are no worries about getting any water, dust or mud on the phone, unlike with some traditional bike mounts for phones positioned on the handlebars.</p>
<h2>Are top tube phone bags waterproof?</h2>
<p>Top tube bags are not entirely waterproof, but they do provide protection from the rain so can be said to be water-resistant.</p>
<p>Some designs of top tube bag come with a waterproof cover, which in all honesty does kind of defeat the purpose of using it as a means to see your phone when cycling.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it makes sure your expensive smartphone stays dry!</p>
<h2>Will my knees hit the bag when cycling?</h2>
<p>This depends on the type of bike you're riding, and your saddle height. Assuming your saddle is set at the correct height, you'll find that most touring bikes have longer top tubes, so your knees shouldn't hit the bag when riding.</p>
<h2>Do Ortlieb make a top tube bag for smartphones?</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, it appears that Ortlieb do not currently make a stem bag for phones. My guess is, that they have not found a way to make it completely waterproof whilst assuring quality that lasts.</p>
<p>They do make a variety of other top tube bags, just none with a phone compartment designed so you can use the phone when cycling.</p>
<p>Note: I always love to be corrected. If you have seen an Ortlieb bag that fits on the top tube and is designed so you can use the phone when riding the bicycle, leave a comment below!</p>
