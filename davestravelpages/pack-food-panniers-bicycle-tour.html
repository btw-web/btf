<h1>How to Pack Food in your Panniers on a Bicycle Tour</h1>
<p><strong>What is the best way to pack food in your panniers for bike touring? Here's a few ideas on how to carry food on your next bike tour.</strong></p>
<h2>Bike Touring Food</h2>
<p>Over the years, I have come up with a few <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/bicycle-touring-tips">bicycle touring tips</a> on how to <strong>pack food in your panniers on a bicycle tour</strong>, and here are a couple which I hope you might find useful on a cycling adventure of your own.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, I use one of my front panniers for keeping my pan, <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/component/content/article/125-bicycle-touring-tips/925-how-to-choose-a-camp-stove-for-bicycle-touring.html">stove</a> and food in, as I like to have it all in one place.</p>
<div class="mv-video-target mv-video-id-r5uweqhb4kvmyov8smop" data-video-id="r5uweqhb4kvmyov8smop" data-volume="70"></div>As I usually have a camp stove such as the MSR, the fuel canister is kept outside the pannier in one of my bottle cages on the frame of the bike to prevent contamination.</p>
<h2>How to Pack Food in your Panniers on a Bicycle Tour</h2>
<p><strong>Storing dry food</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_3529" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3529" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3529 size-full" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/food-storage-for-bicycle-touring.jpg" alt="How to pack food in your panniers " width="400" height="225" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/food-storage-for-bicycle-touring.jpg 400w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/food-storage-for-bicycle-touring-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3529" class="wp-caption-text">How to pack food in your panniers on a bicycle tour &#8211; Storing dry foods.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/best-foods-for-bicycle-touring.html/">Cyclists on any sort of self-supported long distance tour will soon have several regular staples of dry food they rely on, such as pasta, rice, and oats</a>.</p>
<p>These foods are perfect for the touring cyclist, as they provide a great nutrition to weight ratio, and are also pretty economical.</p>
<p>Most of these products start life in a sealed bag which is bought from the shop, and after they are opened, are then placed in further bags to stop food falling into the panniers.</p>
<h2>Using Waterbottles for dry food</h2>
<p>There are a couple of reasons cyclists do this &#8211; We are lazy, cheap, and like to cut down on weight! It's all a bit of a false economy though, so instead, I got into the habit of using spare drinks bottles to store my dry food in.</p>
<p>They are already waterproof, don't weigh too much, and in the event that they are dropped, don't open up and spill the contents everywhere.</p>
<p>Rice and oats are the best things to store in drinks bottles, followed by spaghetti and pasta. Give it a try &#8211; You will wonder why you hadn't done it before!</p>
<h2><strong>How to carry eggs on a bike tour</strong></h2>
<p>This might seem blindingly obvious, but as soon as you buy fresh eggs, boil them! I normally buy eggs only when I can take them back to my camp or hostel and boil them straight away, and they last several days like this.</p>
<p>In some, but not all countries, you can buy half a dozen eggs in a cardboard container, which is the ideal way to keep the hard-boiled eggs safe when cycling. Failing that, wrap them up in some newspaper, and keep them in your camp stove.</p>
<h2><strong>Ziploc Bags for storing camping food</strong></h2>
<p>These are a great thing to have when thinking how to pack food in your panniers on a bicycle tour. I keep coffee, sugar, and powdered milk in separate ziploc bags, along with various other items from time to time such as red lentils.</p>
<p>I will say though, that you do have to be careful when using them, as it only take a small tear in the side, and you suddenly have coffee all over the inside of the pannier!</p>
<p>Standard practice would see me wrap up my ziploc bags in another carrier bag, or put them inside another form of lightweight container such as a powdered milk tub with lid.</p>
<p>Whilst you may not be able to buy them in every country in the world, stocking up on ziploc bags before departing on a long distance bicycle tour is a sensible idea, as they weigh virtually nothing and can be kept at the bottom of a pannier until needed.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of tips on how to pack food in your <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/best-panniers-for-touring/">panniers on a bicycle tour</a> out there, but these are the main ones which have served me well. If you have any more, then please leave a comment below!</p>
