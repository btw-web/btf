<h1>Altura Night Vision Waterproof Winter Cycling Gloves Review</h1>
<p><strong>I have been using the Altura Night Vision Waterproof Winter cycling gloves for five months now, and so I thought it was about time to write a little review of them.</strong></p>
<h2>Winter Cycling Gloves</h2>
<p>Hopefully someone will find it useful, and although winter is now drawing to an end, they might be available on sale during the Spring months, and I am fairly certain they will be released once more (perhaps updated slightly) for the Winter of 2014.</p>

<h2 id="product-display-name">Altura Night Vision Waterproof Winter Cycling Gloves</h2>
<p>Firstly, I should start by saying that I bought these gloves primarily to commute to and from work. In addition to this, I have also used them on several longer winter cycle rides of 60kms or more in wet and cold conditions, and even once or twice unloading lorries outside on a forklift in the rain!</p>
<p>Therefore, although they might not have been used on an extended <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/bike-tours-around-the-world-dave-briggs-bicycle-touring/">bicycle tour</a>, I feel that I have tested them out pretty thoroughly.</p>
<div class="mv-video-target mv-video-id-tt1dzpvufit7wcmyrlgy" data-video-id="tt1dzpvufit7wcmyrlgy" data-volume="70" data-sticky="1" data-autoplay="1" data-disable-optimize="1"></div>
<h2>Winter Cycling Gloves Review</h2>
<p>Ok, so first off, I bought these gloves in black. You might be thinking that this seems at odds with the name Night Vision, but they do have a reflective trim, which means that they get picked up in headlights when cycling along the roads at night. A handy feature.</p>
<p>I was initially concerned that this trim would start to peel off, or even rub away, but five months, it is still there, and the gloves look practically like new.</p>
<p>My next concern, was that I would wear away the palms of the Altura Night Vision cycling gloves, like I seem to do with every pair of cycling gloves I own, but again, there is no sign of this at all. Top marks for quality here.</p>
<h2>Better than Neoprene cycling gloves?</h2>
<p>I have previously owned neoprene type gloves, but whilst they kind of keep your hands warm, they never feel particularly great.</p>
<p>The Altura Night Vision Waterproof cycling gloves have a thinsulate interior, which makes them feel like real gloves. Very comfy and warm.</p>
<p>The only downside to this, is that after extended cycling days (and I mean 50 kms plus), the tips of the fingers start to feel damp from sweat that hasn't wicked away enough.</p>
<p>Combine this with a cold wind, and your fingers do start to get a bit cold. Nothing in comparison to not wearing the gloves at all, but certainly noticeable.</p>

<h2>Are they waterproof cycling gloves?</h2>
<p>That leaves us with how waterproof they are. Here, they score top marks, and my hands were nice and dry after a torrential downpour one cycle ride home from work. (This was torrential, as in roads were starting to surface flood due to how much water was coming down!).</p>
<p>So in conclusion, I have found the <span style="font-size: small;">Altura Night Vision Waterproof Winter Cycling Gloves</span> to be excellent value for money, and they are in more than good enough condition to see me through the next winter.</p>
<p>With luck, I will even take the same pair with me on my next cycling tour around the world to use on the Scandinavian sections of the trip.</p>
<p>Overall, I give them an 8.5 out of 10, and would recommend these gloves for almost any cyclist, ranging from the commuter to the bicycle tourer.</p>
