<p><strong>Are you thinking of using a travel water filter for bike touring? If not, you should! Here's 3 reasons why it's a great idea to use a water filter on your next bike tour.</strong></p>

<h2>Travel Water Filters</h2>
<p>Travel filters have changed a lot over the years.</p>
<p>When I first started bike touring, they were reasonably large and bulky objects.</p>
<p>Today, &#8216;filter straws', steripens, <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/water-bottle-with-filter-for-travel-drinksafe-travel-tap-review/">water bottles with filter</a> and pumps are available in any outdoor shop.</p>
<div class="mv-video-target mv-video-id-yfsysuv0vd23e8rudm1n" data-video-id="yfsysuv0vd23e8rudm1n" data-volume="70"></div>Which water purifier for travel you use is going to be based on your own needs, budget, and even style of bike touring.</p>
<p>This article isn't about how to choose a water filter. Instead, it's about trying to get you to use a water purifying filter for touring in the first place!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16099" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/drinksafe-travel-tap-water-filter.jpg" alt="A look at the Drinksafe travel tap water filter for bike touring" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/drinksafe-travel-tap-water-filter.jpg 1920w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/drinksafe-travel-tap-water-filter-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/drinksafe-travel-tap-water-filter-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/drinksafe-travel-tap-water-filter-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<h2>Reasons to use a water filter for bike touring</h2>
<p>I think that every cyclist planning a bike tour should take a water filter with them, even if the tour is only for a few days.</p>
<p>If you've not already decided to get yourself a portable water filter for bike touring, let me give you some reasons why!<br />

<h2>#1 Filter drinkable water from anywhere</h2>
<p>Ever dreamed of being able to filter water from streams and rivers as you <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/component/content/article/125-bicycle-touring-tips/922-how-to-wild-camp-when-bicycle-touring-around-the-word.html">wild camp</a>? A portable water filter will allow you to do just that!</p>
<p>With the right sort of filter, you can safely drink water from rivers, and some models even allow for water to be pumped out of puddles!</p>
<p>Another big use for a travel water filter, and one that doesn't get mentioned much, is that you can also filter tap water.</p>
<p>In some countries, the water that comes out of a tap isn't drinkable. If it is, perhaps the taste isn't that great. A portable water filter will also take care of that nicely for you.<br />

<h2>#2 Save Money</h2>
<p>We're all looking to <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cut-costs-on-a-bicycle-tour.html/">save money on a bike tour</a> right? Having a water filter can do just that.</p>
<p>All you need to do is work out how much you spend on bottled water during a tour, and you'll soon realise you'll get a good return on investment after buying a water filter for travel.</p>
<p>In most cases, use the water filter 30 times or so, and you've broken even. Any more than that, and you're in profit!</p>
<p>All it requires is that little investment up front, and the rewards can be enjoyed for longer. For this reason, I always tend to look at buying <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycle-touring-kit-list/">bike touring kit</a> as an investment rather than an expense!</p>
<p><script type="text/javascript" src="//forms.aweber.com/form/24/split_1669812324.htm"></script></p>
<h2>#3 Save the environment</h2>
<p>You don't need to be a tree-hugger to realise that there's far too much plastic being used and thrown away carelessly in today's world.</p>
<p>As a cyclist, you are probably more visually aware than most of the empty plastic bottles that roll around on the side of the road and in grass verges.</p>

<p>A travel water filter is going to cut down hugely on the amount of plastic you use during your bike tour. Do the world a favour, and get yourself one!</p>

<h2>Bikepacking Water Filter FAQ</h2>
<p>Cyclists looking at ways to purify water during their bike tours, often have questions to ask such as:</p>
<h3>Which survival water filter is best?</h3>
<p>The Sawyer squeeze systems are a popular lightweight choice of water filtration system. The Sawyer filters are affordable, reliable, and a useful addition for a bug out pack or to take on an extended bikepacking trip.</p>
<h3>How do you filter water while bikepacking?</h3>
<p>Boiling water is one of the best ways to ensure you have water good enough to drink. A purification system is easier though, and makes sure that water contaminants are removed and the water filtered before being good enough to drink.</p>
<h3>Which water filter removes the most contaminants?</h3>
<p>The heavy duty Katadyn Pocket water filter is made of robust materials, making it ideal for long-lasting continuous use on bicycle touring adventures. These pump filters are super reliable at filtering water, and are used by armed forces around the world.</p>
<h3>Does Katadyn remove viruses?</h3>
<p>The Katadyn Pocket Water filter does not remove viruses, but does filter out bacteria and protozoa including Giardia and Cryptosporidium.</p>
