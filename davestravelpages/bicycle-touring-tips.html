<h2>Bicycle Touring Tips</h2>
<p>The bicycle touring tips listed below, are the result of quite a few years spent cycling around the world.</p>
<p>During this time, I've had my fair share of joys and disasters, tricky situations and sublime experiences.</p>
<p>It's been an incredible learning journey, and one that continues almost every time I get on the bike.</p>
<p>By sharing some of the things that I have picked up along the way, I hope to make life a little easier for other cyclists planning their own long distance cycling adventures.</p>

<p>Keep in mind though, no one knows it all, especially me! So, please look on these bicycle touring tips as friendly advice rather than a rule book to follow.</p>
<p>After all, sometimes, half the fun is learning from mistakes made along the way.</p>

<h2>Bike Touring Tips &#8211; Before You Go</h2>
<p>Are you doing everything you can to prepare for your bicycle tour? I remember during the run up for my first tours, everything I did was geared towards making it succeed.</p>
<p>Here's some things to keep in mind.</p>
<h2><strong>Prepare for your bike trip</strong></h2>
<p>Remember your 6 P's (Proper Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance). Being prepared for the road ahead, whether you intend cycling a coast to coast over a weekend, or one end of Europe to the other, can take many forms.</p>
<p>Perhaps you need to build your fitness up, buy certain maps, work out where accommodation is, buy specific bits of gear etc etc. Just winging it works for some people, but being prepared before hand makes common sense. There is no point in making life harder than necessary!</p>

<h2><strong>Educate &#8211; Bike Touring&nbsp;</strong>Maintenance</h2>
<p>Knowing how to look after your bike is going to save you a lot of hassle in the long run. If you are looking at touring for short periods of time, you should at least know how to fix a flat tyre and look after the chain correctly.</p>
<p>If you are going on a long distance cycling tour, it would be beneficial to know how to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_chain">replace a chain</a>, fix spokes, remove the rear cassette, change cables etc.</p>
<p>Some people choose to attend a bicycle maintenance class to acquire this knowledge. Others, including myself, pick it up as they go along over time.</p>
<p><strong>You can take all the tools in the world, but if you don't know how to use them, they are dead weight. Knowledge, on the other hand, weighs nothing.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Test your long distance cycle touring setup</strong></h2>
<p>The time to test all your shiny, new gear is not on day one of your epic cycling trip around the world! Give your kit a run out before leaving, whether it is setting the tent up in the back garden, using a <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/water-bottle-with-filter-for-travel-drinksafe-travel-tap-review/">water filter</a>, or cooking off a camp stove.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, do a couple of rides with your fully loaded bike before you leave. A bicycle weighed down with stuffed panniers feels and handles a lot differently than a lightweight road bike.</p>
<p>It might change your mind as to how much stuff to take as well!</p>

<h2><strong>Eat what you like when cycling</strong></h2>
<p>This does not get included in many people's cycle touring tips, but I really believe it's very important. The chances are, that you have decided what sorts of food you are going to eat whilst cycling. Maybe its lots of rice, pasta, fish, peanut butter, oats, bread etc.</p>
<p>Now ask yourself this. Have you ever eaten these same foods day in day out for a week or more? How many breakfasts does it take before you can't face the sight of oats in the morning again?</p>
<p>If you are going on a long distance&nbsp;cycling tour, and have worked out what sort of foods you are going to eat, try the diet first. Trust me.</p>

<h2>Cycle Touring Tips &#8211; On the Road</h2>
<ul>
<li>Swap your front and rear tyres over every couple of thousand kms. They will last longer.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Getting up early, and doing most of the cycling in the morning is a good idea. It is generally cooler and less windy.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Avoid rush hour traffic wherever possible. This might seem common sense to most people reading this list of bicycle touring tips, but it's important nonetheless.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Take time to smell the roses. Sometimes literally. You are bicycle touring to enjoy yourself and the countryside, not break new land-speed and distance records. (Unless that's your aim of course).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Make the most out of every opportunity. A source of water? &#8211; Fill up all your bottles. A small store in the middle of nowhere? &#8211; Buy food, as it may be the last store for a while. Electric wall socket? &#8211; Recharge all your tech gear.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Don't be afraid to take breaks. Nobody is watching you to see how &#8220;lazy&#8221; you are being, and an hour or more taken out for lunch will restore your energy levels beyond the calorific replacement.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>When braking on long, downhill sections, alternate squeezing between the front and back brakes. On super long stretches of downhill, don't let the rims overheat by constant braking. Pull over and take five minutes out.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Balance your load out. If the panniers are heavier on one side than another, it will put unneeded strain on the hubs and wheels. Pack heavier items towards the bottom of the panniers. &nbsp;Try also to get 60% of the load at the back of the bike, and 40% at the front.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Bicycle Touring Tips &#8211; When It's All Over</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you get back home, unpack your stuff as soon as possible. You don't want to be leaving a wet tent rolled up in a bag for months on end, or it will rot and smell. Air your <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/how-to-choose-the-best-sleeping-bag">sleeping bag</a> etc. It's surprising how &#8220;I will leave it a day&#8221; turns into leaving it for a week!</li>
<li>Label up all your photos. They might be fresh in the memory for a few days, but as time goes by, you may start forgetting where they were taken.</li>
<li>Start planning your next trip!</li>

<h2>Long Distance Bicycle Touring FAQ</h2>
<p>Readers planning their first bike tour &#8211; or even their 30th long distance tour &#8211; for that matter, like to have their bases covered when it comes to touring bikes, making sure they have enough money, and gear.</p>
<p>Some of the most frequently asked questions they have include:</p>
<h3>Which bike is best for long distance touring?</h3>
<p>Specifically designed long distance touring bikes are the best choices when it comes to a long tour. The Surly Long Haul Trucker is perhaps the most well known, but other bikes from companies such as Stanforth, Thorn, Dawes, Koga, and Santos are also excellent choices.</p>
<h3>How do I prepare for a long distance bike tour?</h3>
<p>Once you have all the gear you think you'll need for your bicycle tours, the biggest preparation left is to make sure you're in shape. There's a huge difference between riding your bike on road as a leisure activity, and riding a full loaded bicycle on all types of terrain.</p>
<h3>What is the difference between Bikepacking and touring?</h3>
<p>The edges between bike touring and bikepacking become more and more blurred Generally speaking though, bikepacking takes place on predominantly unpaved roads and tracks, and frame bags are used to pack all the gear needed. Bike touring usually involves carrying gear in panniers or on a trailer, and while not strictly limited to paved roads, it's not normally practical to tackle singletrack like this.<br />
<h3">What is credit card touring?</h3>
<p>his minimal form of cycle touring is ideal for short trips. You can leave the camping gear and cooking kit behind, and instead travel by bicycle with as few things as possible apart from your credit card or cash. You'll simply buy what you need on the way, and stay in hotels at night.</p>
