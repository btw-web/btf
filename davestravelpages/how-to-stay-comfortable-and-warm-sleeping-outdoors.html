<h2>Camping in lower temperatures</h2>
<p>Sleeping outside when its cold can be difficult, but with the right gear and knowledge it's possible to have a comfortable night no matter what the temperature. All you need to stay comfortable and warm while sleeping outdoors is the right gear, clothing, and attitude.</p>
<p>In this guide, we'll show you the right gear and clothing to use for sleeping in various temperatures , as well as some other important things to consider when thinking about how to sleep outdoors.</p>
<p>You can use these tips whether your planning on camping in the snow, or are just concerned that you might get cold at night even if camping in the summer.</p>
<p>Related: <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wild-camping-essentials/">Wild camping essentials</a></p>
<h2>Pack the right camping gear</h2>
<p>Packing the right camping gear is a fundamental aspect of having a good time outdoors during cold weather. You'll want a sleeping pad (either a self inflating one or foam), a sleeping bag rated for the season you are camping in, and a good tent that is waterproof.</p>
<p>Although the tent itself provides shelter, it also traps heat making the inside warmer than outside temperatures. Picking the right combination of these three things is the highest value action you can have when selecting your camping gear.</p>
<h2>Sleeping Bags and Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
<p>If there's one thing to get right, it's a warm sleeping bag. A sleeping bag that's designed to keep you warm in winter is a must for for sleeping outdoors on a chilly night.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-8682 aligncenter" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/a-guide-to-sleeping-bag-seasons.jpg" alt="A Guide to Sleeping Bag Seasons - When choosing a sleeping bag, it is important to choose one with an appropriate temperature rating" width="735" height="1102" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/a-guide-to-sleeping-bag-seasons.jpg 735w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/a-guide-to-sleeping-bag-seasons-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/a-guide-to-sleeping-bag-seasons-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/a-guide-to-sleeping-bag-seasons-300x450.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /></p>
<p>A normal sleeping bag is designed for average temperatures so it will be too thin for very cold conditions and have its temperature rating compromised – a good winter specific sleeping bag should have a temperature rating that will cope with what you expect on a cold camping trip.</p>
<p>You can use a sleeping bag liner for more warmth on a cold night.</p>
<h2>Choose a good camping pillow</h2>
<p>I've literally spent years living in tents and using rolled up clothes as a pillow. When I finally made the swap over to using a camping pillow, the improvement was massive!</p>
<p>It wasn't expensive either &#8211; I think my Karrimor pillow cost me around 3 pounds and has lasted me years of travel adventures!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-28096 aligncenter" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/karrimor-camping-pillow.jpg" alt="Karrimor Camping Pillow for Backpacking" width="1204" height="903" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/karrimor-camping-pillow.jpg 1204w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/karrimor-camping-pillow-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/karrimor-camping-pillow-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/karrimor-camping-pillow-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1204px) 100vw, 1204px" /></p>
<p>It's well worth carrying the extra weight of a camping pillow with you , especially if it is a self inflating one, because you'll be thankful for the extra support when your head hits the pillow on those cold nights. Your neck will also thank you for it.</p>

<h2>Pick the right camping spot</h2>
<p>Location is key to enjoying a good nights sleep in a tent. You'll want somewhere that's sheltered, but will catch the sun as sun as it rises (unless camping in a hot country, when you probably don't want to do that at all!).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-33357 aligncenter" src="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/choosing-a-tent-for-camping.jpg" alt="Choosing a tent for camping" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/choosing-a-tent-for-camping.jpg 1280w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/choosing-a-tent-for-camping-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/choosing-a-tent-for-camping-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.davestravelpages.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/choosing-a-tent-for-camping-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Some key points for selecting where to camp include: Look for dry ground, below the top of a hill is preferred (prevents getting snow up your back), out of direct wind, close to water and trees for firewood. If camping in snow, make sure you're safe from potential avalanches!</p>

<h2>Stay dry</h2>
<p>Even if you've been unlucky enough to be out in the rain all day (which happened to me frequently when <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/cycling-in-canada">cycling in Canada</a>!), you want to dry off and put on dry clothes when inside your tent.</p>
<p>It will help raise your body temperature back up, and on cold nights, you might even want to wear a layer or two of clothing inside the sleeping bag.</p>
<p>Travel tip: I always keep a set of &#8216;dry clothes' separated from the rest of my gear, specifically for use after the day spent outdoors. It's non-negotiable that these clothes always stay dry no matter what!</p>
<h2>How to stay warm in a sleeping bag</h2>
<p>Even if you have the right rated sleeping bag and other gear, it can seem cold on some nights. Therefore, you might want to use a few ideas like these to make sure you keep warm and snug inside:</p>
<p><strong>Use your sleeping bag liner</strong> &#8211; Your sleeping bag will work better if you have a good insulating layer between yourself and the outer material of your bag. A <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/sleeping-bag-liners-essential-travel-and-adventure-gear/">sleeping bag liner</a> will also keep your main sleeping bag cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>Eat some calories before bed</strong> &#8211; Your metabolism slows down while you are asleep, and if you are not eating enough at night then your body begins to turn inward on itself for energy (because there isn't any coming in).</p>
<p><strong>Put a pile of clothes under your feet</strong> &#8211; Your feet tend to feel colder because they are further away from your heart. Use some extra clothes underneath your feet to act as insulation from the cold ground.</p>
<p><strong>Wear a hat</strong> &#8211; If your head is getting cold during the night, wear a hat. I normally wear my <a href="https://www.davestravelpages.com/sealskinz-waterproof-beanie-hat.html">Sealskinz waterproof hat</a> on cold nights.</p>
