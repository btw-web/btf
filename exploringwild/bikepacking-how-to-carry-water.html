<h1>9 Ways to Carry Water While Bikepacking</h1>

<p>Forget about lightweight carbon bottle cages and those little 20oz squeeze bottles. You&#8217;re not going to get very far trying to camp in the desert with THAT setup! All those are good for while bikepacking, in my opinion, is fending off snarling dogs with a squirt to the face.</p>



<p>So the question for today is, <strong>how do I carry enough water on my bike while bikepacking</strong>, especially when it&#8217;s hot and/or dry? </p>



<p>How much water are we talking about? On a normal day of bikepacking in moderate weather you might drink 3-4 liters of water. On hot days it&#8217;s not hard to go through 6 liters! Often there are places along the way to top up, but not always. </p>



<p>If dry camping (no water source nearby) you&#8217;ll need at least another liter for overnight, plus enough to get you to a water source the next day&#8230; </p>



<p>This means a hot stretch of riding in a dry area can require carrying 6-8 liters of water on your bike! This is fairly rare, but it does happen, especially if exploring dry desert areas in the late summer or fall. </p>



<p>With a rack and panniers it&#8217;s pretty easy to throw in some extra bottles or strap them to the rack. People carry a dozen liters or even more with this kind of setup. </p>



<p>But what about bikepacking bags? A soft-bag bikepacking setup is great for streamlining your load and lightening your bike, but how does it fare when loaded down with water like the apocalypse is coming tomorrow? </p>



<p>It can take a little creativity, but it usually <em>is </em>possible to carry quite a bit of water on your bike, even with a bikepacking setup. Some of these ideas will be helpful to pannier tourers too. Let&#8217;s discuss our bikepacking water storage options.</p>

<h2>Tips for Carrying Water on a Bike</h2>



<p>First, a few general principles to keep in mind.</p>



<p><strong>Water, at 2.2 lbs per liter, is heavy</strong>. Heavy things are best carried low to the ground to avoid altering your bike&#8217;s handling, and closer to the center of the frame when possible.</p>



<p><strong>It&#8217;s good to have multiple containers</strong> in case one breaks or leaks.</p>



<p>You want one container you can <strong>drink from while riding</strong>, usually either a squirt bottle or hydration bladder with hose. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s handy to have <strong>at least one bottle</strong> (as opposed to hydration hose) for use off the bike: at camp, for cooking, washing, taking into the tent at night, etc.</p>



<p>In areas with <strong>aggressive dogs</strong>, it&#8217;s nice to have a small squirt bottle you can reach while riding. A squirt to the face usually gives them pause. </p>



<p>Your water containers should be <strong>compatible with your <a aria-label="water filtration / purification system (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://exploringwild.com/water-treatment-bikepacking-bicycle-touring/" target="_blank" class="ek-link">water filter / purifier system</a></strong>. More on this below.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not sure how much water you&#8217;ll need, start with this advice on <a href="https://exploringwild.com/how-much-water-for-bikepacking/" target="_blank" aria-label="estimating water needs (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">estimating water needs</a>.</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s go through all the various ways to carry more water on a bike.</p>



<h2>Bottles in Frame Triangle (2-3 liters)</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m going to start with this one just to get it out of the way, but unless you&#8217;re out for a day ride I don&#8217;t really recommend it. However, it is where most of us start when putting water on a bicycle, so I don&#8217;t want to leave it out.</p>



<p>Your bike likely has one or two places to mount bottle cages inside the frame triangle. This works fine for short rides and even touring setups with panniers, because you&#8217;re not pressed for space. If you&#8217;re feeling creative, you can even mount an extra large bottle cage and carry a couple oversized bottles.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="768" src="https://exploringwild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/monkey-bicycle-Laos-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9913" srcset="https://exploringwild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/monkey-bicycle-Laos-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://exploringwild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/monkey-bicycle-Laos-300x225.jpg 300w, https://exploringwild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/monkey-bicycle-Laos-768x576.jpg 768w, https://exploringwild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/monkey-bicycle-Laos-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://exploringwild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/monkey-bicycle-Laos-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://exploringwild.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/monkey-bicycle-Laos-scaled.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>There is so much wasted space in this frame triangle, you could literally fit a monkey in it. (Forgive me, it was my early days of touring).</figcaption></figure>



<p>But the minute you transition to a multi-day bikepacking setup, sans rack and panniers, I guarantee you&#8217;ll be looking at your frame triangle first. And when you see all that unused space, you&#8217;ll want to switch to&#8230;</p>



<h2>Hydration Bladder in Frame Bag (2-3 liters)</h2>



<p>This is my favorite way to carry water while bikepacking, and if I don&#8217;t need more than 3 liters this is the only method I use. The hose wraps nicely around my handlebars for mid-ride sipping. In the remaining space of my frame bag I carry other dense heavy items, like tools or electronics.</p>

<p>The frame triangle, being relatively low and centered on the bike, is an excellent place to carry heavy things like water without impacting the bike&#8217;s handling. A frame bag is a far more efficient way of using this space than traditional bottle cages, which hold less water and also don&#8217;t provide any extra space for other things.</p>



<p>Riders on full-suspension mountain bikes, or with otherwise limited frame bag space, will have more limited capacity. Don&#8217;t worry though, you have plenty of other options. Read on! </p>

<p>Cons of bladder in frame bag:</p>



<ul><li>Some bikes don&#8217;t have enough space here.</li><li>Hose can be a little fiddly to position correctly.</li></ul>
</div></div>


<h2>Bottle Cage Under Down Tube (1 &#8211; 1.5 liters)</h2>



<p>If your bike frame has room for it, you can mount a standard or even oversize bottle cage beneath your down tube. If your bike doesn&#8217;t have bolts in the right place, electrical tape can work wonders.</p>



<p>If you do carry a water bottle here, know that it will get covered in dirt and mud. I recommend some kind of covered nozzle, or a cap, not the usual exposed quirt nozzle. <a aria-label="This bottle (opens in a new tab)"  rel="nofollow noopener external"  href="https://amzn.to/3BT1BxE" target="_blank" class="ek-link">This bottle</a> works for me, though it&#8217;s a tight fit in some standard bottle cages. Depending on your bottle cage, you also might want a <a aria-label="Voile strap (opens in a new tab)"  rel="nofollow noopener external"  href="https://amzn.to/2yf2RzZ" target="_blank">Voile strap</a> or similar to hold it in place.</p>

<h2>Bottles in Stem Bag (1-2 liters)</h2>



<p>Stem bags are little bags that go on your stem and look suspiciously like the chalk bags rock climbers use, except the <a  rel="nofollow noopener external"  aria-label="bikepacking versions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bikepacking.com/gear/bikepacking-stem-bags/" target="_blank">bikepacking versions</a> are usually more expensive. I use <a  rel="nofollow noopener external"  aria-label="these from Amazon (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/31Iw14d" target="_blank">these from Amazon</a>, one on each side of my stem. They cost $11 each, have a large capacity, and multiple attachment options. Highly recommended! </p>



<p>I like to use my stem bags for snacks, camera, sunglasses, and other small things I access often. But some riders like to use them for water bottles. This is a great way to have a bottle close at hand for drinking and squirting at the occasional snarling dog.</p>



<p>Usually stem bags work best with a standard 24ish ounce bottle. But I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if you could fit up to a 1 liter bottle in some bags, including the inexpensive ones I recommended above.</p>

<h2>Bottles on Front Fork (3-4 liters)</h2>



<p>After my frame bag, this is my next go-to way to carry water while bikepacking. When I need a few liters of extra capacity for a <a href="https://exploringwild.com/bicycle-touring-sudan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="long dry stretch (opens in a new tab)">long dry stretch</a> or super-hot days, I use bottles on my front fork. To make the most of this space, you should use oversize bottles and oversize bottle cages; jump down to the end for some ideas and recommendations.</p>



<p>What is the maximum amount of water you can carry on your front fork? I&#8217;ve only ever used one cage on each side, but I believe you could mount two oversize cargo cages to each side (my Salsa Fargo actually has all the bolts for this), and put at least a 1.5 liter bottle in each cage. </p>



<p>So that&#8217;s 4 x 1.5 = 6 liters! Obviously this only works well for non-technical riding, as it would make the front of the bike very heavy. I&#8217;ve only ever loaded up to 3 liters on my front fork, and that&#8217;s been mostly gravel riding.</p>



<p>Use care when mounting anything to your front fork, to make sure there&#8217;s no way it could slip and jam your front wheel.</p>

<h2>Bottles on Seat Stays (1-3 liters)</h2>



<p>If all those options above aren&#8217;t enough for you, the last frontier of bike-mounted water storage is to make use of your rear seat stays. This will demand some mechanical creativity for the mounting, and extra care to make sure the mounts are solid and can&#8217;t be knocked into your rear wheel.</p>



<p>For many riders, myself included, mounting cages parallel to the seat stays causes heal clearance problems while pedaling. If this is you, then find a way to mount them vertically.</p>



<p>This is the only method on this post that I haven&#8217;t personally used on a trip, so I&#8217;ll send you to <a aria-label="this post by Joe Cruz (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://joecruz.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/attaching-extra-bottle-cages-to-pugsley/" target="_blank">this post by Joe Cruz</a> and <a aria-label="this thread on MTBR (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forums.mtbr.com/bikepacking-bike-expedition/ideas-seat-stay-bracket-water-bottle-cages-1102286.html" target="_blank">this thread on MTBR</a> for the details.</p>



<h2>Cranktank4 (4 liters)</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>It&#8217;s a bold move, but if water capacity is a persistent issue for you (maybe you ride a lot in the desert) then the <a aria-label="Cranktank4 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://alnk.to/4fKWN88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Cranktank4</a> might be just what you&#8217;ve always dreamed of.  It&#8217;s a hard-sided container designed to fit in the bottom of your frame triangle, making even more efficient use of space than a bladder in a frame bag. </p>



<p>I haven&#8217;t tried it personally, but I would think it works best for routes where you&#8217;ll want to carry a lot of water most of the time. Otherwise I like to have my extra water capacity fold down (like a hydration bladder) so I have more space for other things (mainly food). Also, since the container is rigid, check the fit carefully for your specific frame.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:33.33%">
<a href="https://alnk.to/4fKWN88" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img  src="http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0451/0436/5718/products/image_e37f5872-913f-47d2-9b87-e52ba2fab780_1200x1200.jpg?v=1627058926"/></a><a target="_blank" href="https://alnk.to/4fKWN88" rel="noopener"></a>

<h2>Backpack or Hip Pack (3+ liters)</h2>



<p>Between the frame bag, front fork, stem bags, and optional cage mounts (if your bike geometry permits them), that&#8217;s over 10 liters of water capacity! In most climates that would be enough for at least two days of riding, with a night of dry camping in between.</p>


<div class="wp-container-622b506c85fc4 wp-block-group has-ek-typography" style=""><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p>However, there are plenty of cases where you would want to add a hydration-style backpack to the mix, especially for riders tackling more technical trails:</p>



<ul><li>Your frame triangle doesn&#8217;t have enough room for a bladder (especially full suspension trail bikes).</li><li>Your front fork is busy holding other cargo, or is difficult to mount bottle cages to.</li><li>You use your stem bags for other things.</li><li>You&#8217;re riding very technical trail and want to keep your bike&#8217;s handling nimble, and/or keep the weight very light for hike-a-biking and carrying.</li><li>You just need a ton of water, perhaps for 3+ days in hot climates where resupply is unknown.</li></ul>
</div></div>


<p>In all these cases, you want a close-fitting pack that&#8217;s no bigger than it needs to be, and that is comfortable (or close to it) on long days. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ve used my running hydration pack for <a aria-label="Smoke 'n Fire (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://exploringwild.com/smoke-n-fire-2021-third-times-the-charm/" target="_blank" class="ek-link">Smoke &#8216;n Fire</a> and <a aria-label="The Big Lonely (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://exploringwild.com/the-big-lonely-2021/" target="_blank" class="ek-link">The Big Lonely</a>, but the folks at bikepacking.com have <a aria-label="tested a bunch of options (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bikepacking.com/gear/backpacks-for-bikepacking/" target="_blank">tested a bunch of options</a> intended specifically for biking.</p>



<p>In theory you can carry as much water as will fit in your pack. In practice though, anything over 4 liters will probably not be comfortable. Most hydration packs and bladders are made to carry 2-3 liters with relative comfort and stability, but more than that is a gamble.</p>

<h2>Expandable Capacity</h2>



<p>On a long ride like the <a aria-label="Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (opens in a new tab)" href="https://exploringwild.com/great-divide-mountain-bike-route-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">Great Divide Mountain Bike Route</a>, you may have a few water carries that are much longer than the rest. When I rode the GDMBR in 2021 I carried 2-3 liters for 99% of the route, but in just a couple places I needed 6-8 liters.</p>



<p>How to handle this kind of variability? You certainly don&#8217;t want to lug around unused containers for 99% of the route. Of course you can buy an extra bottle or two at a gas station before heading into a dry stretch, but where will you carry it? And what if you don&#8217;t realize it&#8217;s going to be dry until you&#8217;re already away from civilization?</p>



<div class="wp-container-622b506c86d4e wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p>Here are three strategies I use for times like this:</p>



<ul><li>Pack a <a aria-label="stuffable backpack (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/3mSNt3g" target="_blank"  rel="nofollow noopener external"  class="ek-link">stuffable backpack</a> &#8211; very handy in general on a long bike trip.</li><li>Pack a couple <a aria-label="Platypus 1 L SoftBottles (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/2YmmMuk" target="_blank"  rel="nofollow noopener external"  class="ek-link">Platypus 1 L SoftBottles</a> &#8211; they fold down to nothing when empty.</li><li>If you have a squeeze or gravity <a href="https://exploringwild.com/water-treatment-bikepacking-bicycle-touring/" target="_blank" aria-label="water filter setup (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="ek-link">water filter setup</a>, don&#8217;t forget that your &#8220;dirty bag&#8221; can be used as extra water capacity.</li></ul>
</div></div>



<p>Then, when it&#8217;s time to add an extra several liters of water to your bike, you have options. You can strap SoftBottles to, well, anywhere they&#8217;ll fit. You can fill your filter dirty bag and carry it in your stuffable backpack. Even better, move something lighter from your front fork dry bag into your stuffable backpack, and put the water bladder or bottles inside the dry bag on your fork.  I haven&#8217;t tried this but I believe the <a aria-label="sturdy dry (opens in a new tab)" href="https://amzn.to/3bPNkHf" target="_blank"  rel="nofollow noopener external"  class="ek-link">sturdy dry bags</a> I used on my front fork could work as water bladders, in a pinch!</p>



<p>All these solutions allow you to add several liters of capacity when needed, but take up barely any extra space the rest of the time.</p>

<h2>Rack or Trailer</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;ve exhausted all these options and still need more water capacity, a true bikepacking setup might not be for you. With all that weight on the bike, it&#8217;s not exactly going to shred technical singletrack anyway. </p>



<p>If you swap out the saddlebag for a rear rack and panniers, water capacity is far less constrained. Extra bladders and bottles can go in the panniers or be strapped on top. You&#8217;ll want a very sturdy steel rack, and some <a href="https://amzn.to/30KvLR8" target="_blank"  rel="nofollow noopener external"  aria-label="Blue Loctite (opens in a new tab)">Blue Loctite</a> on your bolts. Of course, you do still need to find room for gear&#8230;</p>



<p>And if that&#8217;s still not enough&#8230;. Well, you&#8217;re going to need a <a href="https://surlybikes.com/parts/ted_trailer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="sturdy trailer (opens in a new tab)">sturdy trailer</a>. And a lot of other things too. Good luck.</p>

<div class="wp-block-columns">

<p>If you have oversize cages that can carry these bottles (see next section), it also means you can carry those 1.5 liter disposable water bottles universally available in shops around the world. Though I always try to avoid using disposable bottles when I travel, it&#8217;s nice to have the option as a backup.</p>

<h2>Filtering and Purifying Water</h2>



<p>Whatever containers you choose, it&#8217;s important that they work well with your water filtration or purification method. </p>



<p>Consider factors like whether your gravity setup can easily flow into at least one of your containers, whether your treatment method works well with any volume of water (unlike UV treatment for example), and whether you have multiple containers if you&#8217;re using chlorine dioxide (so one can treat while the other is ready to drink).</p>
