<h1>What should women wear for a bicycle tour in Southeast Asia?</h1>
<p>Just how scandalous are my shoulders and knees?&nbsp; What if it&#8217;s hot out?&nbsp; Is there an exception for people riding bicycles?</p>
<p>Before leaving for my bicycle tour in Southeast Asia I Googled &#8220;What should women wear while cycling in Southeast Asia&#8221; and didn&#8217;t find much.&nbsp; Now that I&#8217;m back from my three months of solo touring in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, I want to answer this question so you can skip my trial, error, sunburn, and purchase of an overpriced new shirt in Vang Vieng.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Standard Advice</h2>
<p>If you ask Google what women should wear while traveling in Southeast Asia, you&#8217;ll find two opposing views.&nbsp; The first says it&#8217;s a conservative region and women should cover their knees and shoulders (and obviously everything in between).&nbsp; The second says it really doesn&#8217;t matter because in the tourist towns people are used to backpackers shuffling around in crop tops and booty shorts.&nbsp; Both are true.</p>
<p>You rarely see local women showing their shoulders and knees, especially outside of cities.&nbsp; Locals even swim fully clothed.&nbsp; Partly this is because they go to great lengths to shield their skin from the sun.&nbsp; Partly it is from cultural norms of modesty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you spend time in towns where tourists hang out you will see young backpackers dressed like they are going to a summer music festival.&nbsp; I saw it all.&nbsp; Some of the clothes they wore would be considered culturally inappropriate on the streets of almost any town in the world, let alone a relatively conservative region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that when I visit someone else&#8217;s culture, I should make an effort to respect their norms.&nbsp; This doesn&#8217;t mean I change everything about the way I dress, but I make an attempt to not be offensive.&nbsp; This is for their sake as well as mine.&nbsp; Life as a solo female traveler, or any traveler really, is much smoother when the people&nbsp;I meet feel goodwill toward me.&nbsp; Why give them a reason to have negative feelings about me before we even interact?</p>
<p>Just to be clear: It&#8217;s unfair that much of the world sexually objectifies women which leads to social restrictions on how we are supposed to dress.&nbsp; It&#8217;s horrible when men use a woman&#8217;s clothing choices as an excuse for harassing or harming her.&nbsp; These things suck and I hate them as much as the next woman.&nbsp; We should be able to wear what we want.&nbsp; But when I travel, I travel in the world that exists, not the one I wish existed.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Are Cyclists Different?</h2>
<p>I knew the above recommendations before leaving for my trip, but there&#8217;s an extenuating circumstance that made me second guess my choices: it&#8217;s frickin&#8217; HOT in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; Hot and humid.&nbsp; Exactly the kind of weather that leaves me craving the breeziness of a sleeveless shirt.</p>
<p>Knowing that the cultural norms around modesty are relatively relaxed in Asia (compared to, say, many Muslim countries) and knowing that the area is a popular tourist destinations so the locals are used to western dress, I wondered if there could be an exception to the dress code for those of us actively engaged in sports (i.e. riding a bicycle, all darn day long).</p>
<p>I experimented with riding in a tasteful sleeveless shirt for a few days in Vietnam and Laos.&nbsp; By tasteful I mean it was not strappy and not plunging in front nor in back.&nbsp; Just a normal, sleeveless, shirt.&nbsp; My cycling shorts came to my knees when standing and just above when biking, and I never changed these as they were all I had and seemed to fit in just fine.</p>
<h2>Sleeveless Shirt Experiment</h2>
<p>So what happened?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing.&nbsp; People treated me no differently.&nbsp; Women still talked to me.&nbsp; Men did not turn into lecherous creeps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One old women was concerned about my sun exposure.&nbsp; She was right!&nbsp; After a couple days of nonstop sun my bare shoulders started feeling crispy.&nbsp; This was one reason I decided to switch back to a shirt with sleeves.</p>
<p>The other reason was that I simply felt uncomfortable riding all day in places where I never saw another bare shoulder.&nbsp; Yes, in tourist towns it&#8217;s common, but as a cyclist we spend a lot of time between tourist towns, in places where locals don&#8217;t see many foreigners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a personal thing, but one of my biggest challenges when bike touring in developing countries is always being so darn conspicuous.&nbsp; I get tired of the constant stares and of being treated like a wealthy alien who just dropped in from another planet.&nbsp; The last thing I need is a nagging feeling that the way I&#8217;m dressed might be raising internal eyebrows even if people are too polite to show it.</p>
<p>So I switched back to short sleeve shirts for the rest of my trip, except for a day or two of lazy pedaling around tourist towns.&nbsp; And I felt more comfortable.&nbsp; Your mileage may vary, but that&#8217;s my story.</p>

<h2>My Clothing Recommendations</h2>



<p>If I could repack for the three months I spent cycling in Southeast Asia, here&#8217;s what I would bring:</p>



<h3><strong>Tops</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Two synthetic stink-proof short sleeve shirts.&nbsp; I&#8217;m normally a huge fan of lightweight merino wool for situations where showers and laundry are unpredictable (merino wool doesn&#8217;t get smelly!), but in the humid climate of Southeast Asia they soaked up too much sweat and didn&#8217;t dry fast enough.&nbsp; I ended up buying a normal synthetic athletic shirt locally.&nbsp; The challenge was keeping it from smelling &#8211; lots of vigorous rinsing in guesthouse sinks.&nbsp; Now that I&#8217;m home, I&#8217;m looking into brands like Athleta and Columbia that make UPF-rated (sun protecting) clothing with anti-odor treatments.</li><li>One lightweight tasteful sleeveless shirt for wearing around tourist towns, if you feel like a change or want to work on that farmer&#8217;s tan.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Sun sleeves.&nbsp; My forearms got a surprising amount of sun while riding and I often wished I had a cool (in temperature, not in looks) way to cover them.&nbsp; Some cyclists wear long sleeves but I value the flexibility of a short sleeve shirt with the option to add sun sleeves when I&#8217;m feeling a little too crispy. </li><li>One long sleeve merino wool shirt, good if you need a little bit of warmth on a cool night or to cover up from sun or mosquitoes.  I love the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IHA8Q6Y/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Icebreaker Sphere Longsleeve Lightweight Hoodie</a> for this purpose.  It&#8217;s easy to slip on as a top layer and always feels comfy and light.   </li></ul>



<h3><strong>Bottoms</strong></h3>



<ul><li>One pair knee length baggy (mountain bike) cycling shorts with lots of zip pockets.&nbsp; I absolutely love these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zoic-Navaeh-Short-Womens-Grey/dp/B07C27JF3C/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545335182&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=zoic+navaeh+bike+shorts+women">Zoic Navaeh Women&#8217;s Shorts</a> for their comfy fit, adjustable waist and plentiful zip pockets.  I used the gray color in Southeast Asia, but my next pair will be black so the dirt and sweat don&#8217;t show.</li><li>Two pair padded cycling shorts, whatever type works for you.&nbsp; Watch out for seams and other places that rub &#8211; details matter when you&#8217;re cycling every day!&nbsp; I liked having two different brands with different levels of padding, so when one inevitably started to chafe a little too much somewhere, I could switch to the other which chafed somewhere different.&nbsp;</li><li>One pair capri-length hiking pants, as backup cycling shorts or two wear around town off the bike.  My favorite are these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Columbia-Womens-Saturday-Trail-Pants/dp/B01N3AVD52/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545335304&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=columbia%2Bwomen%2Bhiking%2Bcapri&amp;th=1">Columbia Women&#8217;s Saturday Trail Knee Pants</a>, in black to avoid dirt and awkward sweat stains. </li><li>(Optional) One pair long lightweight pants for cool nights in the mountains (rare).&nbsp; If I hadn&#8217;t gone to north Vietnam I could have skipped these.</li><li>Idea: sun sleeves for legs?&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t tried these yet but I recently ordered a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pearl-iZUMi-Knees-Black-Medium/dp/B074JPTL7R/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545335451&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=pearl+izumi+sun+knees">Pearl Izumi Sun Knees</a> and I&#8217;m considering them for my next trip.&nbsp; They are lightweight and cover your knees and upper calves, which seems useful as this is where I got the most sun (and the weirdest tan lines).&nbsp; They are tight fitting so easier to ride in than long pants, and probably wouldn&#8217;t irritate the skin on my knees like the capri-length hiking pants did when I rode in them.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Underwear</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Three pair merino wool panties.  I mix it up between these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Merino-Womens-Sprite-Medium/dp/B071XMCB4P/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545335771&amp;sr=8-2">Icebreaker Sprite Shorts</a> and these super lightweight <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0776KNH3X/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Woolly Merino Wool Hipster Briefs</a>.</li><li>Two merino wool sports bras.  I tried a lot of different ones and ended up with two of these: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Icebreaker-Merino-Womens-Sorbet-Medium/dp/B072NGVCK6/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545335601&amp;sr=8-5">Icebreaker Merino Meld Zone Sports Bra</a>.  I like that they come in different colors for wearing under different-colored lightweight shirts without showing through.  I also love that they are padded for modesty, much appreciated when wandering around foreign countries alone, and that they don&#8217;t get stinky when I can&#8217;t wash them properly.  They&#8217;re not cheap, but they work for me and when I wear them every day for months it&#8217;s totally worth it.</li><li>Two pair <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SmartWool-Womens-Ultra-Light-Medium/dp/B0721MJR9G/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545335530&amp;sr=8-12">lightweight merino wool socks.</a></li></ul>



<p>&nbsp;Yes, I love merino wool for underwear. Did I mention it doesn&#8217;t get smelly?</p>



<h3><strong>Outerwear</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Rain jacket or poncho for those monsoon downpours.  You don&#8217;t need expensive alpine-grade Gore-Tex here, just something lightweight and basic.  I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/d/Womens-Active-Pants/White-Sierra-Womens-Trabagon-Pants/B002QGOWKA/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545336053&amp;sr=8-4">Marmot Precip Jacket</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marmot-Mens-PreCip-Jacket-Gargoyle/dp/B075LDZN34/ref=sr_1_3?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545336162&amp;sr=1-3">men&#8217;s version here</a>) for this type of weather, and love that it has pit zips for ventilation in the humidity. </li><li>(Optional) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/d/Womens-Active-Pants/White-Sierra-Womens-Trabagon-Pants/B002QGOWKA/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545336053&amp;sr=8-4">rain pants</a>. I only used these once or twice in chilly, wet northern Vietnam.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Other</strong></h3>



<ul><li>Something comfy to sleep in, I liked a lightweight merino wool t-shirt and running shorts.</li><li>Swimsuit: I didn&#8217;t use mine, as I only swam at locals beaches and went fully clothed like they did.&nbsp; But many tourists do swim in swimsuits in rivers and the ocean.</li><li>One nice and clean shirt for around town, when you&#8217;re surrounded by tourists in Instagram-worthy outfits and get tired of feeling so grubby.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unisex-Original-Multifunctional-Headwear-Cashmere/dp/B07BJ3XWK2/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545336310&amp;sr=8-3">Buff headwear</a>: I LOVE these things!  Perfect under my helmet for keeping sweat out of my eyes on those long hot climbs.&nbsp; Also good as a mouth and nose cover for dusty roads.  Or just for looking a little less shabby when walking around town with hair that didn&#8217;t get fully washed in last night&#8217;s cold bucket &#8220;shower.&#8221;</li><li>Cycling gloves to help prevent nerve issues, sun damage and blisters. I use these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LXUFA1A/?coliid=I1F1QCZ5UOAT93&amp;colid=1SP6Q8HOMZ4N2&amp;psc=0&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it">Pearl Izumi Ride Women&#8217;s Elite Gel Gloves</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pearl-Izumi-Elite-Gloves-Medium/dp/B00LXUIW3S/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545336557&amp;sr=1-1">men&#8217;s version here</a>) but there are lots of good options out there.</li></ul>



<h2>General Notes on Local Dress</h2>



<p>This is what worked for me and made me feel comfortable.&nbsp; Of course it&#8217;s a personal decision.&nbsp; Here are a few more observations on local womens&#8217; dress to help you make up your mind.</p>



<ul><li>Less conservative dress is more common in cities and towns than in the countryside.</li><li>In the countryside you often see women showering in sarongs with bare shoulders, or men working shirtless.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s completely scandalous.&nbsp; It seems to be more of a time and place kind of thing.&nbsp; I got the impression this may be ok for working or for your own front yard, but not ok for running errands or social situations.&nbsp; Where does that leave bicycle tourists?&nbsp; I have no idea.</li><li>Laos and Cambodia were more conservative than Vietnam and especially Thailand.</li><li>In cities I saw local women wearing shorts more often than I saw them wearing sleeveless shirts.</li><li>Locals will probably not confront you about your clothing choice no matter how offensive it is to them.</li><li>Locals usually swim in shorts and t-shirts.</li></ul>



<h2>Dressing for Temples and Religious Sites</h2>



<p>An article about what to wear in Southeast Asia would be incomplete without mentioning temples and religious sites.&nbsp; In general when entering a temple both men and women should have their shoulders and knees covered.&nbsp; In some places this was not enforced at all, though I would still suggest doing it out of respect.&nbsp; </p>



<p>In some places it was strictly enforced, for example Angkor Wat in Cambodia.&nbsp; In Thailand I was turned away from the Royal Palace even in my long shorts, and was surprised to find out they require full-length pants and closed shoes (no flip flops).&nbsp; So, it&#8217;s helpful to have some options available if you want to see all the famous sites.&nbsp;</p>
