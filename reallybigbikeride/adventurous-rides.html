<h1>How To Say Yes To Adventurous Rides Around The World</h1>
<h2>A maverick guide to adventurous rides</h2>
<p>Over the years I’ve been invited on adventurous rides all over the world. I’m lucky to have friends that do interesting things with bicycles.</p>
<p>This is by no means a definitive guide to quitting your job and going on multi-month long-distance bike trips.</p>
<p>It is, however, a short story about how I quit my job (often) and said yes to adventurous rides around the world.</p>

<h3>A dangerous habit of saying yes</h3>
<p>I have a dangerous habit of saying yes. Always have had. My first foray into adventurous rides was with my mates Mark and Gus.</p>
<p>One day, out on our bikes, killing time during the summer holidays, Mark suggested we cycle to his mums&#8217; shop, 12 miles away, in the next town.</p>
<blockquote><p>Certain that we&#8217;d be welcomed as heroes, Gus and I excitedly said yes.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Tea and cake</h4>
<p>We arrived at Marks’ mums&#8217; shop beaming with our achievement, waiting eagerly for a few biscuits or a piece of cake. Alarmingly, Mark was promptly scolded, bundled into the back of his mums’ car, and instructed never to pull a stunt like that again.</p>
<p>Gus and I were on our own. No map, no food, no nothing. We made it home after dark, stealthily crept into our houses, hoping to pretend we&#8217;d never left the village. We didn&#8217;t see much of Mark after that.</p>

<h3>How to quit your well-paid job at the beginning of a financial crash</h3>
<p>Way back in 2008, as the financial crisis hit the news, on the day the Lehman Brothers bank collapsed, I handed in my notice at the local newspaper where I was selling advertising space.</p>
<p>I gave up my company car and fuel card, monthly salary and penthouse apartment to join my old friend Tom at his web design agency. I&#8217;d done it again.</p>
<h4>Challenging times</h4>
<p>Saying yes had got me into a new and interesting situation. We weathered the storm for three tough years.</p>
<p>Happily, even during these challenging times, we learned a lot of stuff, did many fun things, and created some fantastic websites.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sadly, though, we rarely earned enough to pay ourselves. It was time for a change.</p></blockquote>

<h3>How to say yes to adventurous rides around Europe</h3>
<p>My old mate Ade had just about had his fill of budget cuts at the Environment Agency and suggested we go on a long holiday.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d been doing a bit of cycle touring around the UK and we quite enjoyed it. The feeling of freedom out on the open road, wild camping in unusual places, a cheeky pint in country pubs.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was magical and we were hooked.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I wrapped up my business commitments with Tom, Ade and I planned our first big bike trip &#8211; an adventurous ride around Europe. A long-distance cycling challenge to raise funds for bikes to Africa charity, <a href="https://www.re-cycle.org/">Re~Cycle</a>.</p>
<h4>20 countries in 100 days</h4>
<p>We completed our <a href="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/20-countries-in-100-days/">20 Countries In 100 Days</a> challenge successfully, created this blog and raised a couple of grand for Re~Cycle into the bargain.</p>
<p>Saying yes was beginning to feel good. I returned to the UK broke but happy. The rejuvenating effects of a great adventure had restored my confidence and washed away the disappointment of business failure.</p>

<h3>The London Life</h3>
<p>In the spring of 2011, I met a woman, moved to London and fell into another sales role. Saying yes was easy for me. I spent the next three years persuading others to say yes to marketing software. I was rather good at it.</p>
<p>Materially, I had it all; a great relationship, a successful career, a red sports car, but something wasn&#8217;t quite right.</p>
<h4>A bigger fix</h4>
<p>The ten-day trips that Ade and I were making weren&#8217;t enough, I wanted a bigger fix. I longed to be free of stuff and things. I craved a simple life. Rosie wanted a house and a baby. I offered a tent and a bike. It was time to leave. I would make this next adventure alone.</p>
<h3>An adventurous ride around the world</h3>
<p>In May 2015, I attended the <a href="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/cycle-touring-festival/">Cycle Touring Festival</a>, to pick up last-minute information for my first solo adventure. The energy and enthusiasm of the people there were overwhelming. These were yes people.</p>
<p>As ballots were counted in the general election, I sailed the Channel to Rotterdam. I was headed East in search of people, places and a different perspective.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2490" src="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adrian-and-a-kyrgyz-family.jpg" alt="cycling in kyrgyzstan" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adrian-and-a-kyrgyz-family.jpg 800w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adrian-and-a-kyrgyz-family-188x141.jpg 188w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adrian-and-a-kyrgyz-family-494x371.jpg 494w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adrian-and-a-kyrgyz-family-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adrian-and-a-kyrgyz-family-624x468.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h4>People, places and a different perspective</h4>
<p>I set off for Istanbul on my overloaded bike, arriving 70 days later. On a whim, over a Skype call where I said yes to my friend in Vietnam and so flew to Hanoi to join her on an overland odyssey.</p>
<blockquote><p>A new plan to travel overland back to the UK was born.</p></blockquote>
<p>Far away, at the opposite end of the Eurasian continent, I traversed the best of South East Asia and experienced the big Buddhist culture shock.</p>
<h4>A spiritual awakening by bike</h4>
<p>As my journey progressed, I travelled back in time to Myanmar. I crossed Burma into the wilds of North East of India.  Slowly, I zigzagged India up to Nepal, culminating in a spiritual awakening by bicycle.</p>
<p>Finally, with Ade along for the ride, I explored the big nature and wilderness of Central Asia and the High Pamirs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this adventurous ride ended rather neatly in Tbilisi. I enjoyed a few weeks in Georgia before a final shimmy across Eastern Europe. The yes man had done it. A sequence of lifelong yeses had taken me around the world by bicycle.</p>

<h3>An experiment in adventurous living</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m now a full-time <a href="https://www.mindfulblogger.com/outsourced-marketing/">freelance</a> and digital nomad living between India and the UK. The experiment in alternative living and adventurous rides continues&#8230;</p>
