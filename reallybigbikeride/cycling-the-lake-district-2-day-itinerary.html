<h1>Cycling The Lake District 2 Day Itinerary</h1>
<h2>Two days of the best road cycling in the Lake District</h2>
<p>In this article, I outline our 2-day Lake District cycling route. This epic 2-day itinerary includes some of the toughest road cycling in the UK over four of the most challenging passes.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3>Cycling the Lake District</h3>
<p>For this classic four day itinerary, members of Mashup &amp; District Cycling Club arrived in the Lake District from London by train. Our 2-day itinerary for the ride was all about the passes: Honister, Whinlatter, Kirkstone, Wrynose and Hardnott.</p>
<p>We arrived by train into Cockermouth and over the two days made a loop back to the station. We stayed at YHA Borrowdale and YHA Hawkshead. Cycling the Lake District as a loop meant we could do a lot on a short weekend trip.</p>

<h3>Hardknott Pass Cycle Route</h3>
<p>This was one of the toughest bike routes in the UK that I&#8217;ve ever done. Unofficially, the Hardknott and Wrynose Pass are called the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2014/jul/15/in-praise-of-britains-two-most-outrageous-roads-wrynose-and-hardknott-passes">most outrageous roads in Britain</a>. It&#8217;s easy to see why. They&#8217;re steep, narrow and wildly beautiful.</p>
<p>The Hardknott pass profile is immense. 393m of elevation over 2.2km with a gradient of 33%. It&#8217;s a bit of an animal.</p>
<p>On the day I attempted Hardknott Pass I was riding an old-school vintage steel-framed Raleigh racing bike. It has a huge chain ring 42 / 52 &#8211; set up for time trial and triathlon. Nothing like a modern bikes gear ratio and certainly not an easy beast to ride.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s the only climb I&#8217;ve ever dismounted for &#8211; I had to push most of the way up.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Cycling Up Hardknott Pass</h4>
<p>Frustratingly, I failed to get even a few hundred metres up the climb. I bonked shortly before the beginning of the climb and as the road kicked up into Hardknott Pass I slowed to a precarious wobble before crashing down to the ground. I simply couldn&#8217;t turn the pedals quick enough.</p>
<p>Adrian made it all the way up without a hitch, his Genesis sports tourer making light work of the steepest climb in the Lakes. I plan to return on a more suitable machine for a rematch.</p>

<h3>Cycling the Lake District Passes</h3>
<p>Cycling the Lake District passes was a classic ride indeed, taking in some of the toughest climbs in the country. Our Lake District 2-day itinerary included Honiter Pass, Whinlatter Pass, Wrynose Pass and Hardnott Pass. This Lake District road cycling route is not for the faint-hearted.</p>
<p>We planned this Cumbrian bike ride using the <a href="https://www.100climbs.co.uk/">100 Greatest cycling Climbs</a> as inspiration. Adrian had gifted me a copy and we were keen to get out on the bikes to test our mettle.</p>
<p>Mashup &amp; District Cycling Club rides are often deliberately challenging and ideally somewhere that we haven&#8217;t cycled before. Our intention is to stretch the legs, get out in nature and drink in the fresh air of the high passes.</p>
<p>This Cumbrian route fit the bill perfectly. A group ride in the Lakes was just the ticket since there were so many awesome bike routes in the Lake District.</p>

<h4>Cumberland Classic</h4>
<p>I&#8217;d recommend this challenging Lake District road cycling route for more advanced riders. It&#8217;s a lot of elevation gain in unforgiving terrain. I found it all a bit much. I was out of shape mentally and physically. The second half of the day was punishing.</p>
<p>That said, I was happy to have had a weekend away with the lads riding our bikes. The scenery more than made up for the gruelling schedule and a pint at the end of the day always puts things right.</p>
<p>Our two day Lake District road cycling route was not dissimilar to the route of the <a href="https://www.fredwhittonchallenge.co.uk/route/">Fred Whitton Challenge</a> &#8211; arguably the UK&#8217;s toughest sportive event. There are easy bike routes to be had in the Lakes. This is not one of them.</p>
