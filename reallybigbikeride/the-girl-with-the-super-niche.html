<h1>The Girl With The Super Niche</h1>
<p>Regular readers of this blog may recall that when I flew from <a href="http://www.reallybigbikeride.com/london-to-istanbul-stage-one/">Istanbul to Hanoi,</a> it was my intention to meet up with my old friend, Donna, and our plan was for us to travel together for a few months around South East Asia, Myanmar up to  India. <!--more--></p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to do two things; update you on our adventures and tell you why we&#8217;re not traveling together anymore.</p>
<p>Donna and I traveled north Vietnam by bike (bicycle and moto) for three weeks back in late August and early September. We had a blast; we visited hard to find tribes, enjoyed the finest scenery in the northern provinces and <a href="http://www.reallybigbikeride.com/toilet-humour/">one of us shat on a tile. </a></p>
<p>Sadly though, this short, intense trip would be our first and last on this journey. Donna has a career to launch; a career as a travel writer / TV presenter / all round creative whirlwind, and that means deadlines, flights and working incredibly hard. I&#8217;m simply riding a bike to England. We tried it, we thought it could work somehow; traveling overland together to the UK, one by bicycle, one by any other means barring flights, but that&#8217;s not going to happen now. We&#8217;ve talked about it. It&#8217;s cool. We&#8217;re on different journeys.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, Donna&#8217;s adventure promises to be both an interesting and inspiring personal journey &#8211; a very talented woman is she. If you haven&#8217;t already seen her blog about cultural costume, I urge you to check it out. Fashion, textiles, people, places, <a href="http://hauteculturefashion.com">hauteculture.com</a> is evolving daily. I expect big things to happen for my friend. Watch this space!</p>
<p>What of Jim, and the slow, steady sojourn home? I&#8217;m sat in Chiang Mai about to take a motorcycle to Pai for the day. My friend John has flown out to join me for the next few months and we&#8217;re having a lovely time. Next up is Myanmar in a week then India for the New Year. We&#8217;re pretty excited about this next bit. It&#8217;s going to be ace.</p>
