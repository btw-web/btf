<h1>Visit The Cycle Touring Festival For Bikes, Rides And Routes</h1>
<h2>The Cycle Touring Festival at Waddow Hall in Clitheroe is a freewheeling fun weekend of bikes, rides and routes.</h2>
<p>The Cycle Touring Festival is something of a homecoming. In 2015 I set off on my most recent journey. My first big solo trip: UK – Vietnam – UK.</p>
<p>There’s a beautiful symmetry to this year’s event since I’ll be there to give a talk about my experiences from the last two years on the road.</p>
<p>In fact I’ll be giving two talks; one about cycle touring in Burma, India and Nepal and the second talk titled The Consciousness Cycle, is about the life affirming effect of long distance bike travel.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h3>Visit the Cycle Touring Festival to learn more about adventurous journeys by bike at home and abroad.</h3>
<p>The Cycle Touring Festival is held at Waddow Hall in Clitheroe, Lancashire. It is a beautiful old building on the banks of the River Ribble, mainly used for Girl Guiding Groups.</p>
<p>Camping on-site is included in your ticket. If you would prefer not to rough it, you have the option to upgrade your ticket to comfortable B&amp;B accommodation.</p>
<h3>Beer, bicycles and banter</h3>
<p>There is a reasonably-priced bar onsite and we are a short walk or cycle into Clitheroe, where there are plenty of cafes, pubs and supermarkets if you forget anything.</p>
<p>There are just a handful of tickets remaining, so, if you’re interested in cycle touring or bike travel of any description, this is the weekend for you. <a href="http://cycletouringfestival.co.uk/tickets/">You can buy tickets here.</a></p>
<p>If you’re on the fence and wondering what it’s all about, read my thoughts on the weekend as a newbie at the event in 2015 below.</p>
<p>For further reading for those that have a trip in mind, there’s a bunch of useful links to speakers specialising in various regions of the world.</p>
<p>I would love to see you there!</p>
<p>Safe roads.</p>
<h3><strong>The Cycle Touring Festival 2015.</strong></h3>
<p>The first ever Cycle Touring Festival took place at Waddow Hall in Clitheroe, Lancashire on May 1 – 3.<br />
Organised by <a href="https://twitter.com/lauralikeswater">Laura Moss</a>, with a bit of help from husband <a href="http://thenextchallenge.org/">Tim</a>, the event was designed to celebrate all things cycle touring.</p>
<p>During the weekend there were talks by recently returned cyclists such as the lovely <a href="http://pikesonbikes.com/">Pikes on Bikes</a> who specialise in Peru and the Puna in South America.</p>
<p>There were various workshops with Q&amp;A sessions including my particular fave Yoga for Cyclists. All this was interspersed with plenty of tea and cake, set in a beautiful part of Lancashire.</p>
<h4>Sold out!</h4>
<p>Tickets sold out which meant that there were just over 200 cycle tourists in attendance – a lot of lovely people come together to share their stories, offer advice and even go out for a ride…</p>
<p>Since I would be leaving from the event for my first solo tour it was a hugely helpful. The opportunity to ask questions about the places I intend to visit was reassuring.</p>
<p>A last chance to soak up all the latest information from the road from those with fresh perspective.</p>
<p><a href="http://tomsbiketrip.com/">Tom Allen</a> hosted a useful talk about the Middle East.</p>
<p>Neil and Harriet Pike co-hosted a panel on South America with <a href="http://www.contoursofacountry.com/">William Fulford-Jones and Ruth Jarvis</a> which was a very interesting and detailed summary of the possibilities for that continent.</p>
<p>The extreme conditions session was valuable insofar as I can now confirm that I’ll be avoiding places of extreme cold. Props to <a href="http://helenstakeon.com/">Helen Lloyd</a> for her amazing expeditions.</p>
<h4>Lord of the Rides</h4>
<p>I was fortunate enough to meet Stephen Lord over lunch. Stephen wrote the original <a href="http://adventurecycle-touringhandbook.com/">Adventure Cycle Touring Handbook</a> and has a wealth of experience.</p>
<p>A great guy and I feel like we’re on a similar wave length.</p>
<p>We spent most of that conversation helping to shape the ideas of a young guy called Tim to decide when / how / what his first tour should be.</p>
<p>The lad was positively bursting with energy and enthusiasm for the road. I understood his urgency. I look forward to hearing what he decides to do.</p>
<p>Of the evening talks I particularly enjoyed <a href="http://thatemilychappell.com/">that Emily Chappell</a> and her wonderful selection of photographs featuring her vast array of bikes in exotic locations.</p>
<p>Then came the open mike section, a chance for guests to tell a story in a 3 minute timed slot. I jumped at the chance and chose a condensed version of <a href="http://www.reallybigbikeride.com/part-7-turn-left-at-jesus/">this glorious anecdote</a>.</p>
<h4>Fully loaded</h4>
<p>Finally on Sunday after a thoroughly enjoyable weekend it was time to leave. Laura thanked everyone, her parents, the speakers and of course Tim for being awesome.</p>
<p>Cake was given to those leaving the festival for a trip. I was loaded up with the best muffins in Lancashire as a gift for the road. Thank you Laura – they got me <a href="http://www.reallybigbikeride.com/in-the-beginning/">all the way to Hull</a>!</p>
<p>A few stranglers ventured into the town for a few beers and a curry. It was a marvellous way to end a super weekend.</p>
<p>Thanks Ben, Barry, Lucy, Catherine and Kyle for sharing that final meal, it was a joy.
