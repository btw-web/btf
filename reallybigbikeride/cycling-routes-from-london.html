<h1>Easy Cycling Routes From London For A Two-Wheeled Adventure</h1>
<h2>Escape the city with these easy cycling routes from London</h2>
<p>Since the early 2000&#8217;s I&#8217;ve explored the best cycling routes from London. I often found the city a little overwhelming. I just wanted to ride my bike through the clean air of green spaces.</p>
<p>There are a couple of simple rules that we follow when planning a cycle route from London for a fun and enjoyable bike ride.</p>
<p>Stick to B-roads, take the scenic route even if it&#8217;s longer, embrace the climbs, trust local intel, shoot for 60 mile /100 km per day on average, look for a natural feature such as a river or head for the coast.</p>
<p>These loose principles have seen us right over the years. They&#8217;ll help you to plan your own awesome cycling routes from London, around the UK and beyond.</p>

<h3>Easy cycling routes from London that will improve your route planning skills and inspire your next bicycle adventure</h3>
<p>Our bike routes are often planned by Adrian. He&#8217;s a whizz with a map since he spent the early years of his career working at the Environment Agency modelling flood risk in rural places.</p>
<p>Adrian has a penchant for ending the day with a rapid descent. This often means that the morning promises a steep climb.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s the perfect way to warm up the legs and lift the heart rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>This selection of cycling routes from London represents a near-decade worth of bike routes that we&#8217;ve ridden in a group as Mash-Up &amp; District, as a pair or occasionally, just me as a solo rider.</p>
<h3>The Dunwich Dynamo &#8211; the ultimate night ride out of London</h3>
<p>Beginning at London Fields in Hackney, the Dun Run is a turn-up and ride, 196km sojourn into the night towards the lost city of Dunwich on the Suffolk coast.</p>
<p>Participants usually arrive at The Pub on the Park at around 8 pm. There&#8217;s plenty of time for a pre-ride pint and a fistful of peanuts before setting off.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve ridden this iconic night ride three times; 2011 with Adrian as preparation for our charity ride to <a href="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/category/20-countries-in-100-days/">20 countries in 100 days</a>, 2013 solo and 2014 with my mate Fabian and our girlfriends.</p>
<h4>Stick together</h4>
<p>There&#8217;s often up to 1,000 riders taking part so it&#8217;s recommended to stay close to your group if you have one. Make a plan to leave together and keep a steady pace.</p>
<p>This is one of the few cycling routes out of London that needs almost zero route planning since it&#8217;s signposted and mini-maps with a list of directions are offered for a small donation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2270 size-full" src="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mash-Up-and-District-Cycle-Touring-Club-at-London-Fields.jpg" alt="Meeting up at London Fields on the cycling route to Dunwich" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mash-Up-and-District-Cycle-Touring-Club-at-London-Fields.jpg 800w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mash-Up-and-District-Cycle-Touring-Club-at-London-Fields-188x141.jpg 188w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mash-Up-and-District-Cycle-Touring-Club-at-London-Fields-494x371.jpg 494w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mash-Up-and-District-Cycle-Touring-Club-at-London-Fields-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mash-Up-and-District-Cycle-Touring-Club-at-London-Fields-624x468.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Lights are essential, obviously. A reliable front and rear, a <a href="https://amzn.to/3iSlcnW">head torch*</a> is useful and spare batteries should be among your spares.</p>
<p>Pack a light tool kit and a spare tube as a bare minimum. There&#8217;s a great spirit of camaraderie but all riders should be self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Along the way, there are a couple of organised pit stops. The first is at the White Hart at around 10 pm. It&#8217;s a great chance to catch up with other riders and share a pint and some snacks.</p>
<p>Around halfway there&#8217;s a village hall serving hot food. Pasta, hot soups and sandwiches are available. This is first come first served.</p>
<h4>Tasty treats</h4>
<p>I always take a flask of hot sweet Earl Grey tea, a bag of jelly sweets and a Tupperware of mixed nuts, dried fruits and seeds as snacks.</p>
<p>For a ride of this duration it&#8217;s recommended to pack some calorie-dense treats; Soreen, bananas, peanut butter and jam sandwiches and a few Snickers fill my panniers.</p>
<p>Roadside stalls sometimes offer chocolate bars and hot drinks along with the opportunity to refill water bottles.</p>
<p>During the early hours of the morning, it gets cold. Long trousers, <a href="https://amzn.to/3nFkfTN">base layers*</a> and a light jacket are advised. Comfort is king on the long road to the coast.</p>
<p>Once at the beach, it&#8217;s a quick dip in the North Sea, a can of real ale and a Full English at the cafe.</p>

<h4>London to Dunwich to London by bike &#8211; a classic cycling route from London</h4>
<p>Some hardcore couriers and club riders will ride the route back home. For everyone else, there&#8217;s coaches or the train. You can prebook the coach at London Fields before the start.</p>
<p>On a sunny day, it&#8217;s tempting to laze on the pebbles for a few hours before enjoying a roast at a local pub.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve mentioned, this is one of the few cycling routes from London that require zero additional route planning but it does follow our golden rules; B roads all the way straight to the coast!</p>
<p>A great template for a rural bike ride directly out of East London.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/dunwich-dynamo/">Dunwich Dynamo</a> is the ultimate night ride.</p>

<h3>London to Chichester &#8211; an impromptu microadventure by bike</h3>
<p>For our next cycling route from London, Fabian &amp; I decided to head out to the South Downs for a night of wild camping and a brisk cycle to the Roman town of Chichester.</p>
<p>Our initial plan was to cycle to Winchester and camp out in the National Forest but let’s just say that Google Maps’ beta cycling route planner is still a work in progress.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150124_102319769.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-976 size-large" src="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150124_102319769-494x370.jpg" alt="Fabian outside Blacks cycling from London to Chichester" width="494" height="370" srcset="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150124_102319769-494x370.jpg 494w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150124_102319769-188x141.jpg 188w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" /></a></p>
<p>Having set the map to standard car functionality we set a course for Godalming.</p>
<p>Making brisk progress in the crisp winter sunshine we got into a comfortable rhythm gliding through the chilly miles.</p>
<h4>Chiddingfold</h4>
<p>The aim for the day was to find a suitable wild camping spot within easy reach of a decent pub. That box was ticked by the beautifully sleepy village of Chiddingfold.</p>
<p>Just a few miles shy of the South Downs National Park, Chiddingfold boasts a choice of three pubs, and our recommendation for the evening was The Crown, an 800 year old inn.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150124_185345075.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-987" src="http://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150124_185345075-370x494.jpg" alt="The Crown at Chiddingfold" width="370" height="494" srcset="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150124_185345075-370x494.jpg 370w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150124_185345075-141x188.jpg 141w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150124_185345075.jpg 1944w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></a></p>
<p>Our camp for the evening was a rather damp field a couple of miles outside the village.</p>
<p>We pitched up next to a majestic tree towards the top of the hill where the ground was slightly firmer underfoot.</p>
<p>We made a roaring fire and prepared our camp. Fabians <a href="https://amzn.to/3nOQWyj">MSR stove*</a> making light work of cooking supper.</p>
<p>While lounging on oddments of logs and cardboard, earlier procured from the friendly Aussie barman at the pub, we quaffed a smashing bottle of Malbec.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You fellas heading out in to the bush?”</p></blockquote>

<p>At first light, we broke camp and ate a simple breakfast. A bowl of giant couscous, topped with a hearty slab of butter kept from the previous days fry up, a strong coffee and a wedge of Soreen.</p>
<p>By 10 am we were on our way to Chichester. Stopping after 20km at the town of Midford we enjoyed an early lunch and a natter with locals in the café.</p>
<p>One chap had been visiting Chichester for over 25 years so much did he love the natural beauty of the area. We quite agreed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150125_132349778_HDR.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-979 size-large" src="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150125_132349778_HDR-370x494.jpg" alt="pubs are well sign posted on the cycling route from london " width="370" height="494" srcset="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150125_132349778_HDR-370x494.jpg 370w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150125_132349778_HDR-141x188.jpg 141w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150125_132349778_HDR.jpg 1944w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></a></p>
<p>After a time and many photographs, we arrived in the Cathedral town of Chichester. As we arrived in the town we again bumped into the couple from the café in Midford.</p>
<p>A happy coincidence indeed and a chance to get a tip for the best place to visit for a pint and a pub lunch. The Dell Key appeared to be the place to go.</p>

<h4>Cycling routes from London to Chichester</h4>
<p>We had hoped to get down to the coast for a pint and a breath of sea air.</p>
<p>Alas, the light was fading, and with many miles to do once back in London we decided to hop on a train back to the capital.</p>
<p>This cycle route from London had been a good one. We were pleased with the outcome. A total break from the usual weekend routine.</p>
<p>A reinvigorating cycle adventure taking in beautiful countryside, encountering friendly strangers, and just a few miles out of the city.</p>
<p>All planned last minute on a Thursday evening, a brilliant weekend.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150125_140820196_HDR1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-981 size-large" src="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150125_140820196_HDR1-370x494.jpg" alt="Awesome graffiti on a wall of Chichester College " width="370" height="494" srcset="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150125_140820196_HDR1-370x494.jpg 370w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150125_140820196_HDR1-141x188.jpg 141w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20150125_140820196_HDR1.jpg 1944w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></a></p>
<h3>Walthamstow to Southend on Sea &#8211; an easy cycling route from London</h3>
<p>For a leisurely day ride out of London there&#8217;s nothing quite like this bike route to Southend on Sea. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">An easterly journey of just over 70km, through Essex suburbs along country roads to the coast.</span></p>
<p>Getting an early start was always going to be a relative concept given Ade’s proximity to the brewery (Ade is the Ops guy at <a title="crate brewery" href="http://cratebrewery.com/">Crate Brewery</a> in Hackney Wick).</p>
<p>At length, I arrived at the Peanut Factory (Ade’s house) at a leisurely 10 am.</p>
<p>The few miles cruise down from Highams Park were some of the best of the day.</p>
<p>Joggers jogged, teams assembled on the playing fields poised for imminent battle and cyclists in great numbers headed out in the opposite direction bound for Epping Forest.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1021" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1021" style="width: 361px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Narrow-boat.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1021 size-large" src="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Narrow-boat-371x494.jpg" alt="the canal is a great cycle route from london" width="371" height="494" srcset="https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Narrow-boat-371x494.jpg 371w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Narrow-boat-141x188.jpg 141w, https://www.reallybigbikeride.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Narrow-boat.jpg 1944w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1021" class="wp-caption-text">Narrow boat on the Lee Navigation, Hackney Wick</figcaption></figure>
<p>In these few peaceful miles, the bare naked trees lining the sleepy streets of Walthamstow Village cast deep shadows across the brightly sunlit buildings and parked cars.</p>
<p>The mottling effect is a natural camouflage for the day to come.</p>
<h4>Soporific</h4>
<p>Along the towpath of the Lee Navigation lines of nameless narrow boats, two abreast rested calmly upon the glassy waters.</p>
<p>“Ellesmere”, “Soporific” and “Wind Shadow” puffed smoke from their tiny chimneys in an effort to warm their occupants.</p>
<p>Opposite this tranquil scene lay a vast construction site, the legacy of the Olympics being built into its new environment.</p>
<p>Communications buildings were repurposed as centres of learning, trees planted in neat rows and bridges sprung up from the earth across the water connecting the old to the new.</p>

<p>The road out of London proper is an A road we’d rather not cycle again.</p>
<p>The motorists of Romford, Ilford and Basildon are not particularly tolerant and seemed to be out to get us.</p>
<blockquote><p>We were involved in too many near misses for our liking.</p></blockquote>
<p>The behaviour of a vocal minority is frankly embarrassing. Telling a cyclist to use the pavement is clearly foolish.</p>
<p>Calling a cyclist an expletive because they’re in the road where cars are parked in the cycle lane is just a joke isn’t it?</p>

<h4>An easy cycle route from London to Southend on Sea</h4>
<p>Things improved as we left behind the squat local authority blocks and entered the semi-detached suburban sprawl of Upminster.</p>
<p>The roads, if not quieter, then the drivers were certainly more considerate. The highlight of a very short hill was a wonderful windmill at one end of a long village green.</p>
<p>We used this as a marker to see how far we’d come in the hour and a bit we’d begun cycling.</p>
<p>As we pushed on through fen like flatlands we focused our intentions on a summit known as One Tree Hill. At 10% gradient, this is a punchy little ascent that had us up out of the saddle and breathless for the first time on the ride.</p>
<p>We loved it. The view from the top was a pretty good one. Not bad for 90 minutes out of East London. With no sign of a cup of tea occurring any time soon (Pitsea is short on cafes, big on fast food) we cracked on towards the coast.</p>

<h4>B-sides and seasides</h4>
<p>The promise of fish and chips with a giant cup of tea providing the motivation to keep moving.</p>
<p>We cycled out of the rural roads and back into a built-up area following the old A13.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t a bad road, but the drivers were erratic again. There was nothing we could do but keep our wheels turning and heads down, with a course set for sea.</p>
<blockquote><p>The final run into Southend was tidy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wide-open roads banked steeply down to the promenade. The safety of the green two-way cycle path that hugs the coastline made for a speedy descent.</p>
<p>We picked up the <a href="https://www.cyclesouthend.co.uk/get-riding/bike-maps/">cycle path</a> at Chalkwell and followed it through to central Southend and a long-awaited brew.</p>
<p>We arrived at the beach in plenty of time for fish and chips and a lazy Sunday sunset.</p>
<p>A highly recommended day ride to the coast on an easy-to-follow cycling route from London.</p>
