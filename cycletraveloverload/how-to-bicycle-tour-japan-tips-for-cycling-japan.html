<p>It never really imagine of bicycle touring Japan before, but when my cycling buddy Eric Spears over at the The College Picker. Invited me to met him over there I did not hesitate to accept the offer. I have always had this fascination with Japan, when I think about it, it all started when watching &#8220;Tokyo Drift&#8221; from the Fast and furious sequels. It just looked like a an amazing location to travel by bike. </p>



<p>If you have always wanted to travel japan by bike and wonder what it is like we spent over a month cycling around and filmed every single day of our adventure on YouTube watch the playlist here</p>

<h3>Camping is abundant </h3>



<p>One of the things that was great about bicycle touring Japan was the large opportunity to free camp and wild camp pretty much anywhere. We camped in a variety of different locations. Sleeping in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW9HLZV_8ik">octopus</a>, many local parks, on the ground in front of a library, in a MacDonalds, out the front of some Government building, in a soccer goal and an array of other cool locations. </p>



<p>Japan is without a doubt a expensive country and one way to off set the costs is having a go at camping. If one is able to express frugality and resourcefulness it can be a huge money saver. And also give you many memories and stories to tell from your adventures. </p>



<p>There are many offical campsites in Japan. This is a great resource to find some great camp spots. </p>



<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1ZBVjXbJKXFgt7AFBFQlSn5Zx3to" width="640" height="480"></iframe>



<p>We free camped most nights and had absolutely zero hassles from police or locals. If you wish to save money while travelling Japan by bike, free camping is a option. As long as you are respectful and be friendly you shouldn&#8217;t have a problem. Most of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJeDz9-QX_w&amp;list=PLPygN5fVyd_p40eHqNcVArnRDqR2_cGD5">vlogs</a> outline each and every camp spot we stayed at. </p>



<p>It is not like you need to be super stealth when urban camping for free. From our experience as a foreigner travelling through Japan if you do get discovered, you will most likely be given an easy ride. They will greet you with an inquisitive smile and have patience. There was two instances when we camped on a &#8220;Ground Golf&#8221; field and a local seating area in a park where senior citizens would gather in the morning. </p>



<p>At the Ground Golf filed we just laid on the ground under the stars for the night and CP had already waken and woke me. I looked around and this elderly gentlemen was setting up the equipment all around us. He was so polite and din&#8217;t even tell us to move or get mad at us for being in his way. We just kept saying &#8220;sumimasen, sumimasen, sumimasen&#8221; haha. </p>



<p>The other occasion was when setting up for the night under a pergola in a park. This was the exact place a number of Japanese people would gather every morning to socialise. And here are these obnoxious westerners with all their gear spread out. And again these people super polite just stood there for what seemed 20 minutes just waiting for me to pack up my gear, so they could sit down. I have never been under pressure so much to pack up my gear so quickly, haha. </p>



<h3>ONSEN in Japan (hot springs)</h3>



<p>While in Japan a full Onsen experience is a must, nothing beats seeing elderly Japanese men in the nude. In all seriousness those these places are a gem for a bicycle tour. One of things I noticed while in Japan was their attention to cleanliness it goes for there roads and cars. Very minimal litter and the cars are immaculate. But also they seem to like to clean themselves extremely thoroughly.</p>



<p>We went to about two or three onsens in out time over there. Here is a video of the day we spent mostly off the bikes and in the Onsen resting.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgbwRtesR8o&amp;list=PLPygN5fVyd_p40eHqNcVArnRDqR2_cGD5&amp;index=25">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgbwRtesR8o&amp;list=PLPygN5fVyd_p40eHqNcVArnRDqR2_cGD5&amp;index=25</a></p>



<p>This was the <strong>Roadside station Tsuwano-onsen Nagomi-no-sato. </strong>It cost 600 yen per person which is around $7.</p>



<p>All Japanese Onsen seem to have some rules that must be followed to insure the utmost respect. We could get into the detail of how the onsen operates. But the number one rule is to make sure you have a pre-wash or rinse down in the shower at the beginning. This is essentially a thorough scrub down to get rid of any dirt and sweat. </p>



<p>There is no way around this but you got to get in the nude. Yes completely naked! You are not allowed to bring any towels or other clothing into a onsen as they are considered dirty. Which means you have to get in the nude. There is no big deal with this. I guess I have had practice showering with the boys at footy and it is something you just get use to. Plus look on the bright side at least there will be no towel slapping. </p>



<p>Don&#8217;t get too crazy, staying modest in these environments is recommended. It is appreciated that you cover your nether regions with a small towel as you move from shower to onsen and back again.   </p>



<p>Unfortunately if you have ink you are not allowed in. Tattoos are considered unacceptable for entry in a onsen as most people associate tattoos with the Japanese mafia. If you have small tattoos you can cover them with a waterproof bandage. But if you are dripping with ink. You might have to miss out. I have heard that some places who are geared toward mostly foreign customers are more lenient. </p>



<p>Stay for a while and relax after you have finished in the onsen. Most places have a relaxation area. Which is perfect for a big day of riding. I was out like a light and nearly got locked in there when they were closing up. OOPS. </p>



<h3>Huge Discounts on Food</h3>



<p>Japanese food seems very healthy by nature. There are many places to buy food in Japan. During out bicycle tour in Japan we seem to shop at 7 elevens, Lawsons and Family Mart. Also eating out a couple of times at chain restaurants. But we found the savings a value for money at the grocery stores near the end of the day. </p>



<p>Get heavily discounted ready to eat food at the end of the day. We went in the evening after 8pm or so. At participating grocery stores. This was an amazing discovery. Since the food must be eaten by this time at the end of the night most of the food is 50% or even up to 85% off. This reduces food waste and is a a bit thrifty. </p>

<p>Here are a list of some of out favourite meals and snacks</p>



<p>Sashimi Fish Bowl</p>



<p>Pretty much all the snacks you can by from convenience stores; <em>Onigiri stuffed rice triangles and mini </em>red bean buns were some of my favourite snacks. </p>



<p>They also had a variety of interesting snack like this &#8216;every burger&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="333" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20110407-every-burger-hand.jpg?resize=500%2C333" alt="" class="wp-image-511" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20110407-every-burger-hand.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/20110407-every-burger-hand.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>I would also recommend to organise staying at a local families house through <a href="https://www.warmshowers.org/">Warm Showers</a>. This was an amazing experience, to try real home cooked Japanese food and even eating it sitting on the ground. </p>



<h3>The Toilets!</h3>



<p>Japan seem to be ahead of the game in so many things, and for toilets they must have the most advanced toilets in the world. Coming from Australia where we just use any normal western style toilet or even the outback dunny. It was a mind blowing experience to have so much comfort while doing you business. Heated toilet seat, automatic lid (which opens and closes without need to touch it), and a &#8216;butt washer&#8217;, well that is what I call it. A steam of water that shoots up from inside the toilet.. While relaxing to <em>Frühlingslied</em> by Felix Mendelssohn, its enough reason to just stay there all day long. </p>



<p>However in some remote parts of the country you will have public toilets which have only squatters. It is almost like doing yoga as you go to the the toilet at the same time. </p>



<h3>Japan is full of rules</h3>



<p>There are many rules that Japanese people seem to live by and it is a good idea to learn them. Use common sense and be considerate. This is something I knew nothing about before going, and I am sure I probably offended a few people while not knowing it. </p>



<p>Specifically for bicycles you are not allowed to travel on trains. But you can take a bike on any train at any time for free of charge if you store it in a bike bag. Japan has a thing for cleanliness and having a packed bike on a train prevents marking peoples clothing and dirtying the area. </p>



<p>Some other etiquette in Japan considerations</p>



<p>Bowing is a very important one it is a way of communicating or greeting one another other then shaking hands. </p>



<p>Passing money from one to another is different. There is no hand contact in Japan most the stores I visited provide a tray where the money is placed and your change will be provided to. It was a bit awkward finding this out the hard way, haha. A quick story, I was paying for some food in a 7 Eleven and I was handing the cash over the the cashier and they just stood there and didn&#8217;t except the money and I was like what is going on. I must mention I don&#8217;t know much Japanese at all. I firstly thought, Ohh maybe I don&#8217;t have the right amount of yen. Then I noticed them pointing to a space on the bench and I was glaring over thinking what am I suppose to do. And there it was a tray. Ha, it seemed like a pointless way to transition money. But I go there in the end. </p>



<p>Removing your shoes before entering indoors areas on <em>tatami</em> matting is a must. Having shoes which are easy to remove if recommended as you may be doing this multiple times per day. </p>



<p>Have you been to Japan? Or are you wanting to go? Let me know! </p>
