<p>Lately I have been in the market for a smaller handlebar bag for my gravel bike. I normally have bikepacking gear for long across country adventures and this means bigger handlebar bags. But as I am in lockdown and can only really go on shorter day rides. I felt a small handlebar bag was more appropriate. </p>



<p>So in an attempt to find the best handlebar bag that is small for just day riding I searched all over the web to see what I could find. And I thought I might put together this blog article to help any of you looking for a small handlebar bag too. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00257-1.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6327" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00257-1.jpg?w=7952&amp;ssl=1 7952w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00257-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00257-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00257-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00257-1.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00257-1.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00257-1.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>I was looking for a handlebar bag, nice compacted in size. Enough room to maybe store my phone, keys, wallet and or some extra snacks. I also have a top tube bag and snack bag or feed back on the stem. (Photo above). So in combination with a small handlebar bag it makes the perfect minimalist bag setup for long day rides when refueling is needed, and you need to be self-sufficient. As you can see a small handlebar bag would make a great addition for my setup.</p>



<p>These handlebar bags would also make for a good addition to a super minimalist bikepacking setup. Also I am finding that having less weight near the top of the bike at the handlebars is ideal for better control. Instead if you are bikepacking storing the weight more towards the ground for a better centre of gravity is ideal. </p>



<p>Before I was using the Restrap magnet attached pouch bag on a dry bag mount, but it moved around too much when I had no dry bag on the bike. So here are some bikepacking day ride handlebar bags perfect for a little gravel grinding or commuting into town. </p>

<h2>Rapha Bar Bag</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="430" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BBA01XX_KLP_Product_H119_03-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C430&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6329" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BBA01XX_KLP_Product_H119_03-1.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BBA01XX_KLP_Product_H119_03-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BBA01XX_KLP_Product_H119_03-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C459&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BBA01XX_KLP_Product_H119_03-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C612&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BBA01XX_KLP_Product_H119_03-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BBA01XX_KLP_Product_H119_03-1.jpeg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Rapha Bar Bag is a rainproof handlebar bag with a stowable cross-body strap. That means it doubles as a handlebar bag and a wearable bag! Can it get any better?</p>



<p>Available in four different adventure tones; dark yellow, dark olive, black and stone. As it is a handlebar bag and cross body bag it can also be used as a small frame bag. I like the little flare of character with the text on the inside of the bag, &#8220;Pack light, travel far&#8221;. </p>



<p>Made from waterproof material it keeps your gear dry while also offering a firm fit to the bike thanks to the durable straps. The quick release buckles means you can take it off your bike quickly. The outside features attachment points for lights and a reflective webbing which improves visibility at night. </p>



<p>The inside is a bright pink making it easier to see. While having a quick access pocket for smaller necessities and the larger compartment has two internal mesh pockets to keep things neatly organised. For a total of 2L capacity and dimensions are width&nbsp;23.5cm, height 11cm and depth 8cm. </p>



<p>Some reviews have said, &#8220;the quality is what you would expect from Rapha (excellent) and it is just the right size for long day rides. Absolutely love it.&#8221; and &#8220;the quality and finish are of very good quality and it seems very well made a sturdy&#8221;. The bag offers some great value compared to others on the market. Most just focus on storage. While this bag has other features, like, the reflectability, attachment for lights, and the fact that it can be used off the bike with the shoulder strap is a huge bonus. </p>



<p>The only problem that some came across was with the mounting straps with their plastic clamps, as they might scratch your handlebar/frame. Also it is not easy to open whilst moving, it is more of a bag to use when stopped. Priced at €44.00</p>



<h2 id="title">SpeedSleev Diego Handlebar Bag</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="489" height="383" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/413IHrgSQLL._AC_.jpg?resize=489%2C383&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6330" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/413IHrgSQLL._AC_.jpg?w=489&amp;ssl=1 489w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/413IHrgSQLL._AC_.jpg?resize=300%2C235&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/413IHrgSQLL._AC_.jpg?resize=50%2C39&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Honestly nothing really compares to the Rapha bag if you want it all. I would be purchasing that one if it was not out of stock. So here are some other options to choose from. This Diego handlebar bag has very little features that stacks up to Rapha. </p>



<p>However, It is essentially a small handlebar bag that attaches to your bike via Straps securely to handlebars with simple Velcro straps with the bag that is designed with a rugged ballistic nylon shell. </p>



<p>Some reviews says this is a nice quality bag. It might be a good choice if you are looking for a simple designed handlebar bar. However in my opinion it could be improved to be better for use on the bike. <a href="https://amzn.to/2QiLMuO">Priced from $45.00 &#8211; $60.50 on Amazon.</a> </p>



<h2>Banjo Brothers Handlebar Bag Small</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="478" height="477" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-25-at-2.31.55-pm.png?resize=478%2C477&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6331" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-25-at-2.31.55-pm.png?w=478&amp;ssl=1 478w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-25-at-2.31.55-pm.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-25-at-2.31.55-pm.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-25-at-2.31.55-pm.png?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you want something that is a great price and super simple. The Banjo Brothers Small Handlebar Bag might be the answer for you. They say it is made for childrens bikes but it also works on adults bikes. The 120 cubic inches or 2 L gives you just enough room to store some snacks. The weight is&nbsp;7 oz and dimensions are 8″ L x 4.5″ W x 4.5″ H. It also has a rigid liner to prevent any sagging and the reflective strip over a two-way zipper. priced at only $16.99</p>



<p>For this price though it has some drawbacks. Like the straps could be a little bit longer to adapt to varying handlebar configurations. But it is nice to know that it is easy to access gear without it being cumbersome. </p>



<h2>Ornot Bar Bag</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="720" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KN5A5153_2000x.jpg?resize=720%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6332" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KN5A5153_2000x.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KN5A5153_2000x.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KN5A5153_2000x.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KN5A5153_2000x.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KN5A5153_2000x.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/KN5A5153_2000x.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>A bit more expensive bag but you know you are getting quality here with this one. They say that the handlebar bag has enough room for extra food, extra layers, a bag of coffee, multiple glazed donuts, three used-to-be cold beers or a point and shoot camera. The bag features two accessory pockets on the sides designed for quick, one-handed access to your phone. Other users have been able to store a insulated jacket and some tools in their bag. The side pockets are also great for storing snacks. </p>



<p>It is made from heavy-duty, custom printed cordura canvas lined with a water-resistant nylon&nbsp;fabric and structurally shaped with a lightweight plastic insert. Allowing room for 3.5L or storage or you can opt for the Mini which is 1L. Priced at $90.00 (But they are sold out at the moment.)</p>

<h2>Road Runner Burrito Bag</h2>

<p>A great, simple small handlebar bag that has designer looks with industrial strength. And priced decently at $45.00. It is helpful that the bag has the ability to move the mounting strap locations making this bag fit almost any bicycle handlebar. </p>



<p>And it comes in a rainbow of color options to suit almost any style. And they are handmade in USA, so support local companies is also great!</p>



<p>However it is a very small volume bag, weighing in at 2oz and the dimensions are 8&#8243; wide x 3&#8243; diameter which is 0.4L. If you want so more space you might want to opt for their Burrito Supreme Bag which is 2.58L and is priced at $75.00. </p>
