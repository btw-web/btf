<p>Understanding bike geometry can be the difference between injury and no injury. No one needs to be an expert in those crazy geometry charts but having an understanding about what is right for you is important. In this article we will unpick those pesky charts and what the jargon really means. </p>



<p>The thing to remember is that there isn’t one answer to the geometry of a bike, and different bike models will fit you differently. Helpfully bike brands have confused matters further and often change up their sizing and measurements so they can be left virtually meaningless. You need to think about what you want from your bike. In road cycling you’ve got two main options. If you’re riding for hours on end you’ll want a more comfortable endurance fit, if you’re an elite speed demon then you need to be aerodynamic in a more aggressive race fit and comfort can come second.</p>



<p><strong>Endurance geometry </strong></p>



<p>Generally wider wheelbase and needs more stability and comfort. Favours a more upright posture with less reach.</p>



<p><strong>Race geometry </strong></p>



<p>Shorter wheelbase favouring speed, agility and aerodynamics. Lends itself to being fully bent over with a longer reach.</p>



<p>With this in mind, it’s not as simple as that. If you compare two adult males of similar height and weight they won’t have the same bike fit as each other. For example, if one of them sits at a desk all day and they’re tight in their hips, they will sit and ride differently to someone who spends their day standing up or is more active. This translates to the fit of your bike. The right fit can not only create comfort but it can prevent injury and even improve performance. This is why professional bike fitters are so important, they can iron out the small but crucial imperfections.</p>



<p><strong>Size:</strong> this is virtually meaningless between brands, it is not regulated or standardised so a small in one brand will be a completely different fit than another. That is why we are looking into the specifics.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s talk jargon</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="550" height="298" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wpid-Photo-4-Oct-2013-116-am.jpg?resize=550%2C298&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6016" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wpid-Photo-4-Oct-2013-116-am.jpg?w=550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wpid-Photo-4-Oct-2013-116-am.jpg?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wpid-Photo-4-Oct-2013-116-am.jpg?resize=50%2C27&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Now we understand why it’s so important let’s move on from the general overview and dig a bit deeper. Gone are the days of just worrying how long your top tube and head tube are, there’s too many angles and variations in other aspects of the bike now for them to be reliable. Think of this section like your glossary. We will run over some key terms and how they relate to you. </p>



<p><strong>Stack and Reach</strong></p>



<p>You’ve probably heard this phrase used before. This is the most common and simplest way of determining position on a bike. </p>



<p><strong>Stack: </strong>the vertical distance from the middle of the bottom bracket to the midpoint at the head tube.</p>



<p><strong>Reach: </strong>the horizontal distance from the centre of the bottom bracket to the middle of the head tube</p>



<p>So if you have a longer reach and shorter stack you will end up in a more aggressive racing position and if you have a shorter reach and longer stack then you’ll be in the endurance position. These measurements are the best place to start in finding which bike is best for you and your needs.</p>



<p><strong>What about the rest of the bike?</strong></p>



<p>Let’s move to the front of the bike and look at how it is going to handle. If you are looking for a racing bike you need one that will be reactive at speed, if you’re looking for an endurance bike then you will want more stability. This is where fork rate, head angle and trail come in.</p>



<p><strong>Fork rate/fork offset: </strong>the offset from the centre of the hub to the steering axis</p>



<p><strong>Head angle: </strong>top to floor through the steering angle from the centre of the head tube </p>



<p><strong>Trail</strong> the distance between where the tyre makes contact with the floor and where the head angle line hits the floor. Simply, it is how far the contact point ‘trails’ behind the steering axis.</p>



<p>They all influence each other, the trail is probably the easiest measurement to use when thinking about the bikes reactivity. The smaller this number the quicker reactions the bike will have.</p>



<p><strong>Let&#8217;s talk stability</strong></p>



<p>Something else that will make a difference in handling is the wheelbase and bottom bracket drop. A longer wheelbase and lower bottom bracket will give you more stability.</p>



<p><strong>Wheelbase:</strong> the distance between the rear hub and bottom bracket (rear centre) and the distance between the front hub and bottom bracket (front centre). Or the whole distance between each hub for a more basic measurement.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom bracket drop: </strong>how far down the bottom bracket sits in relation to the wheel hubs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lower bottom bracket lowers your centre of gravity and increases your stability.</p>



<p><strong>Chainstay: </strong>tube that runs from the bottom bracket to the rear hub. This length is directly linked to your rear centre wheelbase, so shorter chainstays mean for quicker handling and easier climbing ability. However, as they make your centre of gravity further over your back wheel you can find going too short here means your front wheel may lift on uphill climbs.</p>



<p><strong>What about general positioning?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Seat tube angle: </strong>the angle at which the seatpost sits. This affects your positioning on the saddle rather than handling. </p>



<p><strong>Head tube angle, slack/steep:</strong> this refers to the angle of the head tube to the ground. If it is ‘slack’ the steering will be better at slower speeds for more endurance or MTB riding. If it is ‘steep’ then it will be twitchier for a racing set up.</p>



<p><strong>Head tube length:</strong> the length of the top to the bottom of the actual head tube. This will determine how upright you are. </p>



<p><strong>Effective top tube: </strong>the horizontal distance from the head tube to the seat tube. This takes into account the slope of certain designs and is a good basic indicator or size.</p>



<p><strong>Stem length:</strong> the length or the stem from head tube to handlebars. Increasing this is a way of increasing your reach.</p>



<p><strong>That’s probably enough for now</strong></p>



<p>Now we have introduced you to the geometry of bicycles you will be able to use this when choosing your new bike and understand more of what the specialist is talking about. Obviously, there is a lot more to it but this should get you riding in the right direction.</p>
