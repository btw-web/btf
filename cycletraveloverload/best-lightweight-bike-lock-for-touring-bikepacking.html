<p>When looking for bike lock for bikepacking or touring, you ideally want something that is theft proof and is lightweight. But unfortunately if someone want to steal your bike they will make all the efforts possible to make that happen. No matter how &#8216;good&#8217; your lock may seem, there are some strong tools that if in the wrong hands are no match with some of the best bike locks out there. </p>



<p>But having that said this blog post is dedicated to those who are looking for a bike lock that its main purpose is to keep the beginner thief from stealing your bike. </p>



<p>It seems the lighter weight a bike lock is the less it is able to perform as a strong lock compared to some bulky and heavier options out there. Depending if you have to have something lightweight them you may need to keep an eye on your bike or be quick when you take off to leave your bike locked. As these lightweight locks are great for deterring the casual thief, but someone who carries around specialised tools will be able to cut through just about anything. And this pretty much goes for bulkier locks to. So at the end of the day it is worth it to get a lightweight lock option that is still fairly good quality and holds up to those people who are just trying to pinch your bike.   </p>



<p>Below I have compiled a list of some great lightweight bike lock options for bikepacking and bike touring. All that have been suggested by people who have used them on bike tourers themselves. There are quiet a few different option when it comes to lightweight bike locks that are great for use when bikepacking or touring. </p>



<h2>Kryptonite Evolution Mini-5</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="484" height="319" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-35.jpeg?resize=484%2C319&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4081" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-35.jpeg?w=484&amp;ssl=1 484w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-35.jpeg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-35.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This lock has a anti-theft rating of 7 out of 10. I am not sure if it is possible to get a rating for all the locks on this list but I will try my best. That seems like a fairly good result for such a lock that weighs in at 2.65 lbs (1.20 kgs). Which is not the lightest of options out there but it provides some security from bolt cutters and leverage attacks with the 13mm hardened&nbsp;MAX-PERFORMANCE STEEL SHACKLE. </p>

<p>This lock is lighter then some options and obviously not bulky to carry. Some users reported that the on bike mount rattles a little. But this is user error. If you are going to install the mount it is suggested to watch the &#8220;How to Install Kryptonite&#8217;s Transit FlexFrame-U Bracket&#8221; by KryptoniteLocks. The detail and up close views are perfect for figuring out that pesky little rubber piece. </p>



<p>The lock is as expected by Kryptonite as it is compact, well-protected by its rubbery coat, and smooth to operate. it fits in the back jean pocket easily.&nbsp;Again the only real downside is the instructions for installing the mount on the bike, it is a little confusing to get your head around it, but once you do this lock is a great option at <strong>$108.56</strong> (on Amazon) for bike touring or bikepacking adventures. </p>



<h2>OttoLock</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="706" height="435" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-1-3.jpeg?resize=706%2C435&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4087" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-1-3.jpeg?w=706&amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-1-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-1-3.jpeg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Ideal for opportunity thief and quick stops, not the best solution for a lock that needs to secure your bike when you are a long time away from your rig. Again there are much better locks in terms of strength out there. But you will struggle to find anything that can match a weight of only 145g &#8211; 260g and is easily stowed away, coiling to a compact 3 inch diameter.</p>



<p>It is a great portable option, it is recommended that this lock is not a replacement for a U-Lock. For maximum security, use a redundant locking method with both a U-Lock and a secondary lock.</p>



<p>A combination lock that is priced from <strong>$50.00</strong> depending on what size you get. Keep in mind that this lock is not the best for securing like a U-Lock but it is targeted to cyclists who want a lightweight, less bulky solution. </p>



<h2>Abus 6000</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/51798_6000_90_black_a1_3.jpg?resize=176%2C571&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4088" width="176" height="571" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/51798_6000_90_black_a1_3.jpg?w=308&amp;ssl=1 308w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/51798_6000_90_black_a1_3.jpg?resize=15%2C50&amp;ssl=1 15w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This Abus lock is probably a better option out of the previously mentioned locks in my opinion. It has better ratings and it offers a lock the is much less bulky them traditional bike locks and works rather well at securing your bike. It is described a lock that has the stability of a U-lock combined with the flexibility of a cable lock. </p>



<p>The design of the lock, includes six 5mm steel bars connected with special rivets, which fold together like a yardstick. This lock is up there with the U-Lock and arguably a better lock. It is compact when folded and versatile, as it is able to angle around stuff. It is preferred compared to the U-Lock as it can be readily fit around more things and things with odd shapes.</p>



<p>Another great thing about this lock is how it folds nicely into a bag or the mount that comes with it. Some users have mentioned that it does rattle but it packs fairly small that you could just stow it away in a bike bag. There are thicker and more secure locks out there, but this one strikes a nice balance. And is probably one of the best bike locks for bikepacking and touring. Costing <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/35F2iL9">$59.43</a></strong><a href="https://amzn.to/35F2iL9"> on Amazon</a> (at the time of writing this article, prices may change, it is 54% off!)</p>



<h2>TiGr Lock</h2>

<p>Protect your bike without compromising your ride. That is the TiGr Locks motto. A very lightweight lock option that is built from Titanium weighing from 0.9 pounds to 1.7 pounds depending on what type you opt for. They come in three different designs, TiGr Mini, TiGr Mini + and the TiGr Bow-Lock (this lock is able to secure both wheels and frame to a rack.) </p>

<p>You may be wondering where does this lock longer lock store on the bike? Well it is quiet interesting it comes with mounts that allow for it to store on the bikes frame. Along the top tube. So it is out of the way when not in use. It does come with mounting straps. It does come in a couple different sizes. However it is long enough to secure both wheels and frame to a rack without having to remove a wheel on most road bikes. Long enough (at <em>24 in &#8211; 61cm</em>) to secure multiple bikes. Price starts at <strong>$115.00</strong> for the mini version of the lock. </p>
