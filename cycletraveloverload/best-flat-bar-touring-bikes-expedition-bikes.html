<p>Are you looking for bike suggests for a flat bar touring bike? In this article I have included some of the best touring bike options that come stock with flat bars. Flat handlebars can be great for touring. Providing you are more up right riding position. And better handling and control when riding off-road sections. </p>



<p>But flat bars are not always the best. especially when we are talking about long and strenuous bike tours. Lasting for days and days, weeks to years long. If you are riding flat bars you are really limited to the amount of hand positions, reducing the hand locations where you can more around to stretch and just change where your hands mount on the bars. This can have long term issues for your hands. Which is why I think Trekking bars/Butterfly bars are a great alternative and other Alt bar options. All these bikes are suited to fitting such bars but do come stock with flats. </p>



<p>But it does come down to how you plan on using the bike and everyone is different. Maybe you are looking for a flat bar touring bike to use as a utility commuter, giving you heaps of option for carting stuff around town but you still want that commuter bike ride position and feel. Or flat bars are just your thing and what you prefer then these bikes are great option for your next bike tour or around the world expedition. </p>



<p>Just quick here is the list, in no particular order. </p>

<h2>Salsa Marrakesh Flat Bar</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1440" height="810" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Marrakesh_Deore_Flat_Blue_Carousel-1.jpg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4250" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Marrakesh_Deore_Flat_Blue_Carousel-1.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Marrakesh_Deore_Flat_Blue_Carousel-1.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Marrakesh_Deore_Flat_Blue_Carousel-1.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Marrakesh_Deore_Flat_Blue_Carousel-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Marrakesh_Deore_Flat_Blue_Carousel-1.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Salsa Marrakesh is a great all round touring bike and to make it even better you can get the option for a flat bar. Designed for fully loaded, rugged exploration. The Marrakesh is stable and predictable when heavily loaded, and durable enough to stand up to the abuse of a bike tour. Built from the Cobra Kai CroMoly Tubeset, with a steel fork that comes with a very useful three-pack bosses mounting option. Perfect for adding <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-bikepacking-cargo-cages-dry-bags-bikepacking-fork-cages/">cargo cages</a>. The bike comes with a Marrakesh Alternator 135 Low-Deck Rear Rack which is designed for Marrakesh creating more ride stability, keeping the weight lower. The bike comes stock with 700c/29c wheels but is compatible for up to 700c X 40mm with mudguards. Also Salsa have thought about designing the different bike sizes of each flat bar Marrakesh to be flat bar specific and create a nice fit. Priced from <strong>$1,599</strong></p>



<h2>Salsa Journeyman Flat Bar Claris 700</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1320" height="732" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Journeyman_flat-bar-claris-700-Copper-1920x1080-1.jpg?fit=640%2C355&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4251" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Journeyman_flat-bar-claris-700-Copper-1920x1080-1.jpg?w=1320&amp;ssl=1 1320w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Journeyman_flat-bar-claris-700-Copper-1920x1080-1.jpg?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Journeyman_flat-bar-claris-700-Copper-1920x1080-1.jpg?resize=768%2C426&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Journeyman_flat-bar-claris-700-Copper-1920x1080-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C568&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Journeyman_flat-bar-claris-700-Copper-1920x1080-1.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>Again another Salsa option at more of a budget price is the Journeyman Flat Bar. The flat bar design and geometry of this bike allows for a more upright riding position, which is great for extended bike tours. While the 700c wheels, aluminum frame and fork, and Shimano Claris drivetrain provide speed and efficiency. You can get this bike in a drop bar options as well. And you also get the choice between 700c x 37/38mm or 650b x 2.1&#8243; tires. If speed is one of your main priorities then your best bet is to look at getting the 700c tires. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, but more specifically to these handlebars on this bike. You do get better leverage and control, especially when riding on bumpy and loose surfaces. Salsa have taken the geometry between the Vaya and the Warbird and essentially combined the two to give you this Journeyman. You get low rider rack mounting and all the other mounting for racks and fenders that you could ever wish for. Priced at <strong>$949</strong></p>



<h2>Giant ToughRoad SLR 1 </h2>

<p>The new 2020 Giant ToughRoad SLR 1 is a lightweight aluminium all-rounder the encourages riding on some of the most challenging terrain. The ALUXX SLR aluminium frame and smooth-handling composite fork work well together to combat the rough feel on bumpy and hard surfaces. The innovative D-Fuse seatpost also helps to reduce vibrations and shock. While it has flat bars making it easier to handle on such rough terrain. it comes stock with rear and front racks ready for some panniers. Comes with some nice adventure ready, Giant Sycamore, FlatGuard Deflect 2, 700x50c tires. Another cool feature I like about this bike is the X-Defender down tube protector. It is powered by a 20 speed Shimano Deore groupset. Priced at <strong>$1799</strong></p>
