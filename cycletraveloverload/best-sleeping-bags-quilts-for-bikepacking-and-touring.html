<p>When looking for a sleeping bag or quilt for bikepacking it is highly desired that it is lightweight and packs fairly small. As I am transitioning into a more minimalist bikepacking setup from a bike touring pannier setup. I have been wondering what are the best sleeping bags for bikepacking. During my research through asking many bikepackers directly and searching all over the web. I came to discover that not only sleeping bags are what other bikepackers use and recommend but also quilts too. </p>



<p>So this article we are going to dive deep into all the best sleeping bags and quilts that were suggests by other bike travellers. </p>

<p>But before we get into the details. We should cover the things you should be looking for in a sleeping bag or quilt for your next bikepacking adventure?</p>



<p>Maybe you would want to consider a quilt instead of a sleeping bag they are generally lighter as they don&#8217;t include some parts that are on a sleeping bag. A great lightweight and small packing quilt with a sleeping pad can get down to the size of a coffee can. </p>



<h3>Sleeping Bag Vs Quilt</h3>



<p><strong>What&#8217;s the difference between a sleeping bag and a quilt?</strong></p>



<p>A sleeping bag or quilt? It is a very popular debate amongst bikepackers. So which one is better? They all have their own pros and cons, but hopefully we can come to a choice and figure out which one is best for you. </p>



<p>Quilts are generally a lighter option then their sleeping bag equivalent. If weight is a big thing for you, a quilt might be your best bet. They are around 20% to 30% lighter overall. Quilts have less parts then a sleeping bag which makes them lighter. </p>



<p>Due to having less parts like, zippers and a hood they are able to pack smaller then sleeping bags in general. The great thing about bikepacking bags is you can stuff them in and work them down, or mount them on your handlebars. But with less volume required that means more space for storing food and other gear. </p>



<p>One of the things with quilts that has me a little skeptical is the ability to keep you warm enough like a sleeping bag would in really cold environments. As I am a side sleeping, quilts sometimes result in the drafts and you will get a little chilly. But to reduce this, the better quality quilts now come with neck collars, width options and&nbsp;improved&nbsp;attachment systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another thing with quilts is you will need something to keep your head warm, during those colder months, as they don&#8217;t include any hood. A beanie or layering up and using your hood on your jacket is a simple solution to this. It is using the gear you have in conjunction with the quilt. </p>



<p>With a quilt you also are using your sleeping pad in conjunction too. A insulated pad helps keep your underside warm while using a quilt. </p>



<p>With quilts you have no zipper issues. As they have no zippers, there is nothing to snag or break. If you are a side sleeper quilts are typically more preferred. They allow more movement and are less restrictive. You could use a sleeping bag that is open however you don&#8217;t have a attachment system with a sleeping bag like you do with a quilt, therefore there maybe drafts that come in. </p>



<p>Sleeping bags are simple, especially the mummy bags, you just hop in a sleep away. With a quilt there are many attributes to making them work the best, and a sleeping bag is just simple. If you are camping in the middle of winter in below freezing temperatures, then you are probably better of with a mummy sleeping. Also sleeping bags are better for people who are not worrying too much about packed weight. A quilts price in theory is cheaper then a sleeping bag, but it is hit and miss.   </p>



<p>So are quilts better than sleeping bags?</p>



<p>Well it depends who you ask! And how you intend to use them. Again for a summer trip a quilt would be best to minimize weight if that really matters to you. And lets face it the less weight and space gear takes up in bikepacking bags the better. But if you are bike travelling out in winter conditions you need to have a well tuned quilt system or a simple mummy bag is your better option. There are still some really lightweight and small packing sleeping bags available, check out the list below, where I compare all the best options recommended by bikepackers. </p>



<h3>Best Sleeping Bags For Bikepacking</h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with the sleeping bags that were recommended by other bikepackers who highly suggest these options. Best for anyone heading off on a lightweight bikepacking adventure. Who are looking for either a summer or winter option. That are lightweight and pack fairly small.</p>



<h2>Western Mountaineering Ultralite Sleeping Bag</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="291" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultralite.png?fit=640%2C155" alt="" class="wp-image-3079" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultralite.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultralite.png?resize=300%2C73&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultralite.png?resize=768%2C186&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultralite.png?resize=1024%2C248&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultralite.png?resize=50%2C12&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Western Mountaineering sleeping bag is the first on out list. The bikepacker I was talking to mentioned that they have had this bag for over 13 years and it is still going strong. The zipper never gets stuck. Has a cosy baffle around neck. And very warm but also not to hot. </p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>Shape</td><td>Degree</td><td>Stuff Size</td><td>Claimed Weight </td><td>Material</td><td>Price</td></tr><tr><td>Mummy</td><td>20 F</td><td>7 x 13 in</td><td>1 lb 12 oz / 794 grams</td><td> ExtremeLite,  nylon taffeta &#8211; Insulation : 850+ fill down</td><td>From $510</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>The more I think about paying for more for bikepacking kit, it seems more of a better idea instead of buying cheaper stuff. If it lasts for 13 years plus it is well worth the investment. This particular bag starts at $510. All the customers who have purchased this bag are over the moon with it! Read the reviews here at Back Country. </p>



<h2>Kelty Cosmic 40 F Degree Down</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="588" height="215" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/d4a9becd-7d63-4cbd-8d40-76f061c4b83c.jpeg?resize=588%2C215" alt="" class="wp-image-3081" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/d4a9becd-7d63-4cbd-8d40-76f061c4b83c.jpeg?w=588&amp;ssl=1 588w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/d4a9becd-7d63-4cbd-8d40-76f061c4b83c.jpeg?resize=300%2C110&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/d4a9becd-7d63-4cbd-8d40-76f061c4b83c.jpeg?resize=50%2C18&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This is Kelty&#8217;s most popular 3 season sleeping bag, that comes in a incredible price from $129.95. It is a solid summer sleeping bag that stays warm even if it does get damp. It compresses to a small volume of 7 x 13 in / 18 x 33&nbsp;cm which is comparable to the above $500+ sleeping bag. And a very similar if not identical weight as well for a fraction of the price. However it is only good to 40 Degrees not down to 20. </p>



<ul><li>This Kelty bag will keep you warm in 40-degree temps</li><li>It&#8217;s very comfortable, soft against the skin.</li><li>It&#8217;s lightweight. </li><li>It&#8217;s easy to pack into the stuff sack</li></ul>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>Shape</td><td>Degree</td><td>Stuff Size</td><td>Claimed Weight </td><td>Material</td><td>Price</td></tr><tr><td>Mummy</td><td>37 degrees (F)<br>2 degrees (C)</td><td>7 x 12 in / 18 x 30.5 cm&nbsp;</td><td>1 lb. 9.7 oz. / 794 grams</td><td>50D Polyester Taffeta Liner, 20D Nylon Taffeta Shell With PFC-Free DWR, 600 fill power DriDown™</td><td><a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F147926%2Fkelty-cosmic-40-sleeping-bag-mens">From $129.95</a></td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>One thing to note is to take care when washing. Be careful that the down doesn&#8217;t move to the edges in wet clumps, use the dryer balls that are recommended and follow the instructions. Some users have had problems with this sleeping bag when washing, but they neglected to follow the instruction, and now they are cold! </p>

<h2>Aegismax UL Mummy Bag</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/91FS9OJ7tVL._SL1500_.jpg?fit=640%2C1004" alt="" class="wp-image-3083" width="351" height="550" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/91FS9OJ7tVL._SL1500_.jpg?w=765&amp;ssl=1 765w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/91FS9OJ7tVL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=191%2C300&amp;ssl=1 191w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/91FS9OJ7tVL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=653%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 653w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/91FS9OJ7tVL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=32%2C50&amp;ssl=1 32w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Aegismax was recommended by some bikepackers who picked this sleeping bag due to its $80 price tag, available on Amazon. It is the cheapest sleeping bag that I could find that was also suggested for bikepacking adventures. </p>



<p>It is a super minimal sleeping bag that could maybe be categorised as a quilt as it has no hood, but has a zipper. It is super light and is ideal for those spring and summer bikepacking trips. It is a very thin bag and it is claimed to go down to 30 to 35 F but would shine around 40 F or around 4 C. </p>



<p>It has a cinch pull cord and velcro strap at the top of the bag allowing you to tighten around your next to trap warmth in, since it has no hood. It comes with a great stuff sack that makes it a small unit for bikepacking. And it only weighs a grand total of 408 grams for the regular or 14 to 15 oz. </p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>Shape</td><td>Degree</td><td>Stuff Size</td><td>Claimed Weight </td><td>Material</td><td>Price</td></tr><tr><td>Mummy</td><td>30 to 35 F / -1 C to 2 C</td><td>4.7 x 8.3 in / 12cm x 21cm</td><td>from 408g or 14.4 oz</td><td>Outer&nbsp;shell&nbsp;fabric:iFlex 20D Nylon with DWR, high density down proof weave<br>&nbsp;Inner&nbsp;fabric: iFlex 20D Nylon with skin &amp; soft, high density down proof weave</td><td><a href="https://amzn.to/31oYR8U">$80.00</a></td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>The great thing again about this bag is that it is only $80 over at Amazon, It also has good reviews too. <a href="https://amzn.to/31oYR8U">Go check it our for yourself if you want more information.</a></p>

<p>This is a technical, ultralight fill down bag is designed to excel is all conditions.  For all the UL bags out there, this one seems the best for the warmth to weight ratio. It is a little steep at $569.95, the rating on this bag is 20 degrees (F) or  -5 degrees (C). They seemed to run true to the rating without any issues. </p>



<p>It is a greta bag that would dry in the sun in less than an hour after getting wet, after days of rain this bag kept me insulated. It is a durable enough bag that it never ripped when it was laided out to dry on logs, rocks hung in trees. It weighs in at around 1 lb. 15 oz / 879 grams, but it is worth every dime. </p>
