<p>Here at Cycle Travel Overload we are big fans of bikes that are able to go where others are not! But we also have a thing for gravel bikes, or drop bar and off-road capable bikes. However, the niche genre of drop bar mountain bikes seem even more cable then your standard gravel bike and they take it a step further. </p>



<p>It is debatable whether some of these bikes could be officially considered a &#8220;mountain bike&#8221;. But our main criteria for bikes making it into this list is on wheel and tire sizes. They need to big and wide enough to attack some of the most demanding terrains. Much like a true mountain bike. The minimum tire width for this list is no less then 2.1&#8243; tires. Some come with something like a 50 mm gravel tire but also they have the option to house larger and knobby tires for a complete drop bar mountain bike build. </p>



<p>Along with that these bike needed to be most easily available to the consumer weather that be in store or online. While obviously only having drop bars. One could say though that most of these bikes have a more touring/adventure or gravel bike geometry more so then a true mountain bike. But the main use for these such drop bar mountain bikes is for adventure and bikepacking. </p>



<p>These bike are designed around a drop bar. While you could change your MTB flats to drops on your current MTB it is not recommended as the geometry for a mountain bike generally has a much longer reach and it would not work well with drop bars. </p>



<p>Please keep in mind that these top 8 are out personal favourites here at Cycle Travel Overload. There are many other mountain bike options out there with drop bars. But here are some of our favs!</p>

<p>The Sutra is a bike that I personally own and that is why it is up here at the start. I have had experience riding this bike and it rolls like a dream on so really rough terrains. Such a supple bike, I really cannot get over how nice it rides! The vision Sutra had for this bike was for them to design a drop bar bike that felt like a mountain bike and rode like a mountain bike but had the speed of a road bike. And that is what they have accomplished! It is a great bike that merges between a mountain bike and a touring bike! <a href="https://www.konaworld.com/sutra_ltd.cfm">Priced from $2,199.00</a></p>



<p>It features SRAM Rival 1 hydraulic disc brakes, a 1x drivetrain and beefy yet fast-rolling 700x50c tires. And also does feature a SRAM Rival 1 groupset. The wider bar comes with a 16-degree flare. Fits up to 29×2.2″ without fenders and comes with the 73mm race face bottom bracket.
