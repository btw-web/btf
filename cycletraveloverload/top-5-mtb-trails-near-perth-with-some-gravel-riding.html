<p>This series of articles I’m bringing bikepacking closer to home. I’m looking at bikepacking, mountain biking and gravel biking in Australia. With border restrictions up in the air the staycation inspiration is what I need, I don&#8217;t know about you guys! </p>



<p>I love dreaming about overseas adventures but it’s killing me not being able to properly plan for one so I’m looking at what riding I can do in Australia to tingle my travel tastebuds. </p>



<p>For this one, I’m looking far away over the other side of Australia in Perth. They say people live in Perth because they like the outdoor lifestyle and the weather, so what a perfect combination for getting out on your bike!</p>



<p>Perth is the most remote city in the world, it’s closest capital city isn’t even in Australia! It’s a 3.5hour flight away from me in Victoria. </p>



<p>With that, comes lots of space and to me that means a lot of outdoor exploring! There are 60 huge National Parks in Western Australia (WA) and most of them have mountain biking options!</p>



<p>There are miles and miles of shared cycle paths up and down the coast for those roadies amongst us, but it’s less well known what there is for the more adventurous amongst us, so I’ve been having a little dig around.</p>



<p>I went to Perth last year and did a lot of hiking with friends (I didn’t take my bike) so I know there’s some decent shared hiking tracks around. But what about trails for gravel bikers and mountain bikers? I hear you ask. </p>



<p>Well let’s have a look. Perth is home to the origin of the famous Bibbulmun track hiking trail (which you can’t ride on) and the extensive Munda Biddi Mountain biking trail (which you definitely can and should ride on). Stay reading to the end to find out more about this mega option.</p>



<p>Top 5 mountain biking trails near Perth</p>

<p><a href="https://trailswa.com.au/trails/goat-farm"><strong>Goat Farm</strong></a></p>

<p>These trails are the closest MTB trail to Perth City. They lie 4km from Midland train station so are very easily accessible to those living in the city or western suburbs. </p>



<p>This park is for more specialised and skilled riders. It caters for XC, downhill and 4X riders. There is one main XC trail which is about 6km long that is linked up with technical uphill and a fast flowing cross sectional trail. </p>



<p>If you’re more of a fast and furious kind of rider than the 4 main downhill tracks might look interesting. They are fast, technical and full of berms and rocky sections. They have recently added a new skills park too which looks fun! </p>



<p>They’ve got berms, table tops, rock drop offs, see saws, logs platforms and loads more, you can spend a good few hours messing around just in the skills park here. Just be aware there is minimal shade coverage here so on hot summer days it can get pretty relentless.</p>

<p>Sitting just 40 minutes from Perth City is one of the most popular mountain biking parks in Western Australia. It&#8217;s got over 40km of signposted single track and caters for green beginners to black diamond experienced riders. </p>



<p>There’s pump tracks, flowy forest easy rides, climbs, berms, jumps, rocky outcrops, hairpins, tabletops, wall rides and log rides to name a few! There are local bike and equipment hire and repair shops, alongside post ride cafes and pubs. </p>



<p>You can spend all day here, or all weekend if you bring your camping gear. Definitely one of my favourites I’ve found.</p>

<p>Here is an extensive trail network about 200km south of Perth. There are easy rides for families, downhill cross country sections, rocky technical sections, flowy forest trails, log rides, and adaptive hand cycle paths which can all be accessed via the Munda Biddi or from the closest town of Collie. </p>



<p>This is a really fun looking day out for all abilities and for those with disabilities. Largely catering for easy to moderate difficulties and the forest is really beautiful around there.</p>

<p>If you’re after something short and punchy then the loop trail at Forsyth Mill up in the Perth hills might satisfy you. It&#8217;s a 6km cross country loop with minimal inclines but some more difficult obstacles towards the end. </p>



<p>Think fast corners, tight turns, log overs and finishing with some jumps and obstacles. It’s only a short (ish) loop but there’s nothing stopping you doing it a few times, and if you’re with a mixed group of mates you can always easily regroup in the carpark if someone falls behind. </p>



<p>It’s less than an hour drive from Perth City and has a beginner loop for a warm up or if you’re with inexperienced riders.</p>

<p>For me, this is the grand finale. The Munda Biddi trail is Western Australia’s off road jewel. It’s 1000km of purpose built off road bikepacking route. It starts in the Pert Hills in Mundaring and ends on the beautiful Southwest coast at Albany. </p>



<p>This is the longest track of it’s kind in the world! Munda Biddi Trail means ‘path through the forest’ in the local Noongar Aboriginal language. </p>



<p>This trail takes you to discover plants and wildlife you can’t find anywhere else on Earth. Under your wheels will be classic Australian red dirt one day, farm land the next day and sand the day after that. </p>



<p>You’ll travel through ancient forests, rocky outcrops, farmland and towering Eucalyptus trees. The trail is purpose built, this means access to camping, accommodation and facilities is relatively easy. </p>



<p>You can do it on a gravel bike or a basic mountain bike most of the trail is easily accessible by car so you can just do little sections if you don’t have the time to do the full length (and back).</p>



<p>So it’s safe to say I’ll be heading back to Perth and bringing my bike with me to try the Munda Biddi trail out when the borders open. I might leave the gnarly technical skills park at the Goat Farm to my more experienced and skilled friends though!</p>
