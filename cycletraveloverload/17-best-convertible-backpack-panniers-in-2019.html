<p>Ever since I found out about panniers that convert to backpacks, were a thing, I have been amazed. Such a useful product idea. These pannier backpacks are the best if you want to get of your bike and do some walking. You just take the pannier of and with the convertible back straps it becomes a backpack. It is always good when you buy a product that has multiple purposes. </p>



<p>Perfect for the daily commuter that does not want to carry their luggage on their back while cycling. But stills wants to cart their stuff around with them into work easily. </p>



<p>The bags included include innovative ways in which the clips to the rack are hidden away, or designed in other unique ways. Not obstructing the back and causing discomfort while in use as a backpack. </p>



<p>I myself have had the issue of carting around a heavy Ortlieb pannier in one hand while I go into libraries while on tour. I also share a nifty gadget that converts your current Ortlieb panniers into a backpack. There so good I am considering getting one!</p>



<p>So in a attempt to &#8216;shop around&#8217; I searched the web for all the bags I could find. And I compiled the best convertible pannier backpacks and included it in this article in hopes that you get some benefit out of it. </p>



<h3>Things to consider when looking at pannier backpacks</h3>



<ul><li>How does it hold up, in terms of durability?</li><li>Does it get dirty? and how easy is it to wash?</li><li>Has that specific pannier backpack had problems with hooks getting bent or loose?</li><li>Insure the size and dimensions, prices, weight and style all add up to your personal needs and requirements. Would your laptop fit and other gear you intend to use it for?</li><li>How easy is it to convert into a backpack or pannier? </li><li>Is it comfortable to wear as a backpack?</li><li>If you are only using one pannier on your bike rack when fully loaded, riding can change your bike control and balance</li><li>Is it a waterproof pannier backpack?</li><li>How does the pannier backpack fir onto your current bike rack setup?</li></ul>



<h3><em>Blackburn Wayside</em> <strong>Backpack Pannier</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="700" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048.jpeg?resize=700%2C700" alt="" class="wp-image-1583" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048.jpeg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048.jpeg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The Wayside is a very stylish waxed canvas backpack pannier. The laptop pocket on the inside of the bag ends a few inches above the base of the bag meaning that your laptop stays of the base of the bag. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="679" height="679" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BBN-Wayside-Backpack-Pannier-Specs.jpg?resize=679%2C679" alt="" class="wp-image-1584" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BBN-Wayside-Backpack-Pannier-Specs.jpg?w=679&amp;ssl=1 679w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BBN-Wayside-Backpack-Pannier-Specs.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BBN-Wayside-Backpack-Pannier-Specs.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BBN-Wayside-Backpack-Pannier-Specs.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The Wayside attaches to a bike rack with velcro straps. That does take a little bit longer then expected (around 1 to 2 minutes). Wrapping the velcro and stowing the straps is slower than standard pannier hanging hooks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="700" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048-1.jpeg?resize=700%2C700" alt="" class="wp-image-1585" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048-1.jpeg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048-1.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>Having that said the velcro straps seem to be thick enough to be functional and quality. If you are looking at converting quality from backpack to pannier you may want to look into the banjo brothers convertible instead (mentioned below). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="700" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048-2.jpeg?resize=700%2C700" alt="" class="wp-image-1586" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048-2.jpeg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048-2.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/12048-2.jpeg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The water bottle webbing on both sides of the Wayside are large enough to store a standard bike bottle easily or a medium sized reinforced Ulock.</p>



<p>This backpack pannier is a budget friendly option, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Q03d5U">pricing comes in at a reasonable <strong>$79.95</strong> on Amazon</a>. Other bags in comparison are more expensive or require proprietary rack systems. </p>

<h3><strong><em>Banjo Brothers</em> Convertible Backpack Panniers</strong></h3>

<p>The Banjo Brothers delivers the goods with a waterproof backpack/pannier. Quick to attach and take off to your bike rack. It is also comfortable to wear on the back. They have really thought about how this bag is intended to be used. </p>



<p>Larger sized backpack that gives you potential to store heaps of gear. Very quality, versatile and durable bag, seems to last a while and stand up to wear and tear over time. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="720" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/01130_banjobrothers_backpack_pannier_black_stripes_720x.jpg?resize=720%2C720" alt="" class="wp-image-1590" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/01130_banjobrothers_backpack_pannier_black_stripes_720x.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/01130_banjobrothers_backpack_pannier_black_stripes_720x.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/01130_banjobrothers_backpack_pannier_black_stripes_720x.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/01130_banjobrothers_backpack_pannier_black_stripes_720x.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The inside of the bag does not have a organised section, just one big area to chuck stuff in, which is still great. </p>



<p>Some users of this bag have mentioned that they have had waterproof issues. You need to make sure when using this bag to fold the top over twice. Also the tow outer pockets are not quite waterproof. </p>



<p><strong>Other things about this backpack pannier</strong></p>



<ul><li>The top flap does not cover the bag opening when in &#8220;pannier&#8221; mode. Instead, it covers the backpack straps. I&#8217;d be more confident of the waterproofness with an extra layer over that opening.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="720" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/01130_banjobrothers_waterproof_backpack_pannier_720x.jpg?resize=720%2C720" alt="" class="wp-image-1591" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/01130_banjobrothers_waterproof_backpack_pannier_720x.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/01130_banjobrothers_waterproof_backpack_pannier_720x.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/01130_banjobrothers_waterproof_backpack_pannier_720x.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/01130_banjobrothers_waterproof_backpack_pannier_720x.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<ul><li>In pannier mode, the backpack straps are folded on themselves and held up with horizontal loops located on the straps. I&#8217;m not fond of this arrangement and instead use the sternum strap clips to pull the straps up.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The bottom of the pannier is secured with a closed triangle hook. The bag comes with two small metal hooks to add an anchor point to racks that don&#8217;t have a peg or similar protrusion.</li></ul>

<p>This is another good budget bike bag option, just like the Blackburn Wayside. A review on Amazon summed it up nicely, &#8220;&#8230;..If you are on a budget and looking for a bike bag, save yourself the sunk costs of bags you don&#8217;t like, and just buy this one.&#8221; <a href="https://amzn.to/2N9m3Fk">The Banjo Brothers Pannier Backpack comes in at <strong>$89.99</strong> on Amazon.</a></p>



<h3><strong><em>Arkel Bug</em> Pannier Backpack</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/274.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="" class="wp-image-1592" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/274.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/274.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/274.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/274.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Bug Pannier/Backpack &#8211; myemail.constantcontact.com<br></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although a pricer bag compared to the first two mention in this article. The Arkel Bug is well thought out and sturdy. Working very well as a pannier, with a extra clip, making sure it stays well secure to the rack.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="BUG CONVERTIBLE PANNIER BACKPACK" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o2mKNFCVMxY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p> It is a mediocre backpack. The stiff backing is somewhat comfortable. While the hook sometimes ends up poking into your back. It seems all the quality making it a average backpack makes up for it as a pannier.</p>

<p>It is easy to hook the bag on and off onto the bike rack in pannier mode. Also includes a good array of compartments and excellent storage capacity.</p>



<p>Price on <a href="https://www.arkel-od.com/">arkel-od.com</a> is <strong>$214.99 CAD</strong></p>

<p>The bag is waterproof keeping clothes dry while being ridden during the winter through rain and wind. </p>



<p>Sadly, it has to be mentioned that a customer did have a clip issue where it broke from the bag after about 6 months of use. Still a really good bag but just not sure about its strength with the clips. </p>
