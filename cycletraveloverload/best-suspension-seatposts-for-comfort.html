<p>Are you looking to add more comfort to your ride? If you ride a rigid gravel bike for example and want some more suppleness. You could reduce the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-tire-pressure/">tire pressure</a> and even change over to <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-gravel-cyclocross-fork-carbon-steel-suspension-gravel-forks/">suspension gravel forks</a>. But a cost effective way is to install a suspension seatpost. </p>



<p>Suspension seatpost are popular with endurance cyclists who are riding many hours per day and are looking for the extra comfort from the rough sections. You can go out and buy a new titanium or carbon gravel bike which will be super comfortable. But if you already have a modest bike but are looking for extra on bike comfort you don&#8217;t need to go out and buy a new bike. You can buy aftermarket suspension seatposts which work well to add extra comfort. </p>



<h2>What is a suspension seatpost?</h2>



<p>A suspension seatpost is just like any other bike seatpost but it features a special suspension system between the top part that connects the saddle. It is great for smoothing out rough and bumpy terrain, allowing you to ride in more comfort for longer. Making them perfect for bike touring or bikepacking that require longer and multiple days in the saddle. When you body weight is applied to the saddle the seatpost slightly moves and absorbs most of the force. Allowing you to feel less of the bumps. </p>



<p>Apart from tire pressure the next thing when it comes to bike comfort and this is proven is seatposts. Responsible for a lot of your bikes overall comfort while riding. When compared to a frame, seatposts flex much more which equals better comfort. So at the end of the day you are probably better off getting a flexible seatpost then a new bike if comfort is the issue. </p>



<p>Especially for those of use who love to explore off the beaten path. On bikepacking and touring bikes they are designed with handlebars to be in a more upright position, this results in more of our body weight to be distributed mostly on the saddle and seatpost. Making it even more important for use to consider the right seatpost for comfort all day over many weeks and months of bike exploring. </p>



<p>There are many different types of seatposts. Like carbon, titanium and aluminium. Along with suspension seatposts we are going to talk mostly about the best suspension seatpost but also these other material seatposts to as they can offer some amount of comfort to. Suspension seatposts can sometimes be to heavy for some who are counting grams. And therefor a carbon seatpost might be better. </p>



<p>But suspension seatposts come in either ST or LT versions. ST means short travel and this refers to the amount the seatpost moves around 1.5&#8243; travel for short travel. Then you have LT which is Long Travel and this means more amount of travel. </p>



<p>Many people I have talked to about using suspension seatpost say how well they preform and offer extreme comfort while cycling. People who have had serious back issue and the seat post is just so helpful! some have even said that it &#8220;quite literally saves my arse&#8221;. </p>



<p>Although a lot of the people I asked about their experiences with suspensions seatposts, the majority say that they are one of the best investments they made. However, it might be expected that in the first months you might get a bit too lazy and less alert using the body for natural suspension on&nbsp;real bumps. This could be a potential issue with using these over a period of time you might lose the habits of awareness and physical reaction to terrain. On the contrary being relaxed on the saddle is a huge plus!</p>



<p>Also it is worth noting that some suspension seatposts can have changes in the saddle to pedal distance, and that can be hard on come people knees, potentially causing issues.</p>



<h2>Are suspension seatposts any good?</h2>



<p>The short answer is you need to find a good quality one. Some users have reported that some of the cheaper alternative suspensions seatposts don&#8217;t work as well at offer comfort which they should. When sitting sometimes they are constantly bobbing and this can get annoying. You want one that is more firm but still has that nice comfort factor. </p>



<p>If you are riding mostly off road some argue that they become pointless as they don&#8217;t work as well at dampening vibrations on the real rough stuff. And you are most likely standing up when you send it down rough single tracks anyway. But you are still going to be sitting at times, especially to get traction on climbs in mud, over wet rocks and roots. And that extra little comfort can make all the difference. </p>



<p>Also the cost and maintenance may put some people off. They are rather expensive and require fixing over time. While a normal seatpost doesn&#8217;t. Some would say just another thing to go wrong.  </p>



<p>One of the biggest reasons to consider a suspension seatpost is the potential energy savings. If you are riding for multiple days or even months at a time. Saving energy wherever you can is so worth it. </p>



<h2>What is the best suspension seatpost?</h2>



<p>And now we have some of the best suspension seatposts that have been recommended by bikepacking and bicycle touring enthusiast who are people that spend many hours consistently on the saddle. These are the seatposts they recommend for ultimate on bike comfort. </p>
