<p>Like other bikepacking destinations the UK may not be home to the world&#8217;s tallest mountains or highest mountain passes but it certainly has something special to offer the eager and beginner bikepackers. </p>



<p>The rolling green hills, windy coastlines and picture perfect historic towns make this little island somewhere I really want to explore. Being from Australia we have strong historic links to the UK and many of our friends and family have roots there. </p>



<p>I’ve always been fascinated with it and love researching about it and got a bit too into this post, so apologies for it’s longer length. Because of its milder climate and less harsh landscapes it is somewhere amazing for beginners to find their feet, just be prepared to get caught in the rain or even snow!</p>



<p>Unlike other larger countries I’ve researched, where you can go for days without seeing another human you are never far away from a tiny village and traditional local pub, a quaint Victorian farmers cottage or a modern city with Roman roots. </p>



<p>You can cover a lot of varying ground in only a few days here. Places being closer together means you can restock on food and water regularly so you can travel lighter and take on more challenging trails. </p>



<p>The routes I’m looking at in this article will take you off the beaten track and find you camping next to a dry stone wall in the beautiful British countryside, sipping whiskey by your campfire in the Scottish highlands or snacking on welshcakes in the valleys of Wales. </p>



<p>Pack your waterproofs, your mosquito repellent and your tent (or even your hammock) and let&#8217;s see what this little island can do!</p>

<h2><strong>Peak District</strong></h2>

<p>Set North of the centre of England is the expansive Peak District National park. Filled with reservoirs, forests, boulders, climbs and country pubs you’ll not be short of trails here.</p>



<p>It is hotspot for hikers, climbers and cyclists. There are a few must-try trails around Edale and Kinder Scout, including the single track of <strong>‘Jaggers Clough</strong>’ and the bumps of ‘<strong>Jacobs Ladder</strong>’. </p>



<p>If you’re travelling light and ready to take on some more technical riding and hike-a-bike sections then you can enjoy the tracks around <strong>Ladybower and Derwent reservoirs</strong>. Then ride on to scratch your climb itch around the ominously named ‘<strong>Dark Peak</strong>’ region. </p>



<p>There is a challenging boulder laiden climb called ‘<strong>The Beast</strong>’ and some smoother and faster gravel parts around ‘<strong>Middleton Top</strong>’ which are worth a visit. </p>



<p>During my research I haven’t found too many set bikepacking routes through this region, there are so many fun options and separate loops or sections that you can link together for multi day adventures. </p>



<p>If you’re not camping then there are youth hostels in Edale, Castleton and Ilam which are cheap and warm. A lot of the trails are shared with hikers so be aware in the more popular areas.</p>



<h2><strong>Lake District</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="540" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lisa-standing-at-Buttermere-Lake-short-breaks-in-the-Lake-District-900x675.jpg?resize=720%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6770" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lisa-standing-at-Buttermere-Lake-short-breaks-in-the-Lake-District-900x675.jpg?resize=900%2C675&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lisa-standing-at-Buttermere-Lake-short-breaks-in-the-Lake-District-900x675.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lisa-standing-at-Buttermere-Lake-short-breaks-in-the-Lake-District-900x675.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lisa-standing-at-Buttermere-Lake-short-breaks-in-the-Lake-District-900x675.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Following the Rivera</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Close to the border between England and Scotland this is an outdoor lovers paradise. The stunning glacial ribbon lakes next to steep rugged hills and quaint historic villages make this one of the most beautiful places in England. </p>



<p>Popular with hikers, fell runners and cyclists the climbs are more severe than the Peak District and the views arguably more striking. If you’re here in the winter months (Nov &#8211; Feb) expect snow and closed roads.</p>



<p>One of the day routes I have found which offers some technical riding, hike-a-bike and fun downhills is near to the popular town of Windermere. The <a href="https://lakesmtb.co.uk/routes/staveley-3-passes/">‘Staveley 3 passes’</a> route takes you from the nearby town of Staveley up to Kentmere and over the fells to Haweswater and back. </p>



<p>It’s a 40km loop with 2400m of climbing which can be made into part of an extended trip if you’re heading up into Scotland or other areas of the district. Expect bridleways, boulders, technical downhill and epic scenery. </p>



<p>If you want something a bit longer and more gruelling then have a look at the <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/lakeland-200-uk/">‘Lakeland 200’</a> which is 200km of the best the Lake District has to offer, be ready to pick your bike up and earn your dinner! There&#8217;s more than 6000m of ascent over 4 days and a difficulty rating of 8.5/10. </p>



<p>Make sure you pack light!</p>



<h2><strong>Scotland</strong></h2>



<figure><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/d/embed?mid=1iahq5wbp1mDVhF6NzxaIosxwjxs" width="640" height="480"></iframe></figure>



<p>Scotland is a bikepacking dream and we can’t really lump the whole country in one section so we have included a few options here. Be ready to sleep in bothies, fight off the midges and drink some of the best whiskey the world has to offer.</p>



<p>You’ll be riding through forests, past crystal clear lochs and hopping on and off islands.</p>



<p>First up, we have found a 655km loop around the Western Isles and aptly named ‘Adventure Coast’ near Glasgow. The route has been named <a href="http://bikepackingscotland.com/argyll/">‘Wild about Argyll’</a> by the local riders and the elevation gains are hectic with a total of 13,800m! It passes through lots of towns so you should be able to travel light and fill up as you go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After you’ve messed around in the West there’s the <a href="https://www.cairngormsloop.net/">Cairngorms Loop</a> to be tried. This is run as a self supported time trial event spanning 300km around the breathtaking Cairngorms National Park. You don’t have to be in the event to ride here though. </p>



<p>If that isn’t enough for you why not combine the Cairngorms loop into the <a href="http://bikepackingscotland.com/centralbelter/">‘Central Belter’</a> 1200km route! A hefty option if you’ve touched down in Edinburgh.</p>



<h2><strong>Wales</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TransCambrian-21.jpg?resize=720%2C405&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6771" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TransCambrian-21.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TransCambrian-21.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TransCambrian-21.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TransCambrian-21.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TransCambrian-21.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Chris Goodman</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The little tiny country off the West side of England is full of secluded trails and awesome rolling greenery (and sheep). </p>



<p>The first trail takes you from the English border right through the valleys to the Irish Sea. <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/trans-cambrian-way/">‘The Trans-Cambrian way’</a> spans 166km and will fill your boots full of mud, sheep poo and tranquility. You’ll pass pubs and B n Bs to sleep and eat in to save your load. This trail takes you up to the Snowdonia National Park which is the next part of your tour through Wales. Home to Mt. Snowdon, this highest mountain in Wales, the surrounding landscape is a rider&#8217;s paradise. </p>



<p>There’s a great but difficult 30km one way route to the summit of Snowdon via the <a href="https://www.walkupsnowdon.co.uk/snowdonia-walks/walk-up-snowdon-via-the-snowdon-ranger-path/">‘Snowdon Rangers path</a>’ then you can descend the other side on bridleways if you’re continuing on further. Snowdon is very popular on the weekends so be sure to avoid these times!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Norfolk</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="481" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Norfolk-Trains-Overnighter_31.jpg?resize=720%2C481&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6772" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Norfolk-Trains-Overnighter_31.jpg?w=2250&amp;ssl=1 2250w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Norfolk-Trains-Overnighter_31.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Norfolk-Trains-Overnighter_31.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Norfolk-Trains-Overnighter_31.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Norfolk-Trains-Overnighter_31.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Norfolk-Trains-Overnighter_31.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Norfolk-Trains-Overnighter_31.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>CHRIS COLES</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Norwich is the county capital of Norfolk and is a small city in the South East of England and travelling around the area offers some easier but still beautiful riding. </p>



<p>There’s no mountains to contend with and might be a perfect place to start out or take the family. There’s some great camping spots and even boat trips across the Norfolk Broads. </p>



<p>We have found a route called the <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/norfolk-trains-overnighter/">‘Norwich Overnighter’</a> which includes a classic British seaside town, railways, bridleways and single track. </p>



<p>This is a fantastic overnight trip for a weekend away scattered with traditional pubs and everything quintessentially ‘British’. </p>



<p>If you start in Great Yarmouth and do the route in reverse you can leave Norwich and head down to historical Cambridge for those on a longer journey.</p>



<h2><strong>Must visit places in the UK</strong></h2>



<p>I’ve compiled a shortlist of some must visit places near the routes I’ve found to get your travel taste buds tingling. The routes are must visit places by themselves so I’ve looked more at towns and sights so you can add them into your own itinerary.</p>



<h3><strong>Must visit places in the Peak District</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<h4><strong>Bakewell</strong></h4>



<p>Right in the heart of the Peak District is the quaint town of Bakewell, home of the original Bakewell tart dessert. Narrow streets with small stone houses are just what we wanted from this village in the countryside.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Chatsworth House</h4>



<p>A lavish period stately home and gardens now owned by the National Trust. You can ride around the land and right past the house and up through Chatsworth Park.</p>



<h4>Manchester</h4>



<p>The lively city of Manchester is about a 50 km road ride through the Cheshire countryside from the Peak District. Known for its music scene and industrial history you can spend a rest weekend here going around the museum of science and industry (MOSI), go to a gig, buy more coffee and resupply.</p>



<h4>Lud’s Church and the Roaches&nbsp;</h4>



<p>You’ll have to get off your bike and walk for parts of these. Lud’s Church is a deep mystical chasm which will transport you straight to Lord of the Rings! If rock climbing is your thing then a short ride away are the Roaches boulders for a fun day clambering and bouldering outside.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Must visit places in the Lake District</strong></h3>



<h4>Windermere</h4>



<p>Very popular tourist town home to the famous children’s author Beatrix Potter. The town has markets, outdoor gear shops, lake boating and cute cafes. A good place to resuppy, rest or stay overnight if you aren’t camping.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Grasmere</h4>



<p>Often voted one of the most beautiful places in the Lake District and home to many artists past and present, make sure your ride goes through here. Maybe you can stock up on the famous gingerbread or mint cake too, yum!</p>



<h4>Helvellyn&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Claiming the 3rd highest ‘mountain’ in England this is a popular hiking spot with great views but once you’re up you can follow the single track on the ridgeline and use this as a connecting route rather than a day hike as many others are. Be aware of the weather at the top though it is often misty and sometimes snowy!</p>



<h4>Castlerigg Stone Circle</h4>



<p>Near the town of Keswick and Derwentwater is the 5000 year old stone circle landmark. There’s a bit of a steep climb on the road to find it but the views are amazing and there have been 1st century ancient Roman remains found nearby too!</p>



<h3><strong>Must visit places in Scotland</strong></h3>



<h4>Edinburgh</h4>



<p>Seems an obvious choice picking the Capital City but it really is a beautiful city with an epic castle. If you’re staying a few nights then it has a world famous comedy fringe festival in August if you’re there which is worth a visit!</p>



<h4>Ben Nevis</h4>



<p>The highest mountain in the UK lives in Scotland and has some pretty special views from the snowy top. Worth ditching your bike for the day to discover this.</p>



<h4>Whiskey distillery&nbsp;</h4>



<p>You can’t visit Scotland and not take a trip to a distillery! There are so many to choose from so have a gander which ones are near your chosen route and treat yourself to a campfire glug!</p>



<h3><strong>Must visit places in Wales</strong></h3>



<h4>Slate mines</h4>



<p>There are several slate mines in the Snowdonia region, this was a large part of Welsh industrial history and some are still working today.</p>



<h4>Aberystwyth&nbsp;</h4>



<p>A stopping point between the two routes is the coastal town of Aberystwyth. Ditch your bike and take a ride up the funicular railway or on an old steam train from the Vale of Rheidol Station.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Must visit places in Norfolk</strong></h3>



<h4>Norwich</h4>



<p>A small city in the county of Norfolk with really pretty architecture, cafes, markets and shops.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Cambridge&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Home to the prestigious university, classic architecture and lots of bikes! A pretty place to stop off and explore if travelling through England.</p>



<p>There’s so much to explore here that you will never be bored. I just love the history and luscious grassy hills that are waiting to be discovered. </p>



<p>Remember, it is technically illegal too wild camp in England and Wales so either arrive as it goes dark and leave as the sun comes up or ask the landowners permission and always <a href="https://lnt.org/">‘leave no trace’</a>. </p>



<p>Let me know if you’ve been bikepacking through the UK and what your favourite routes were. </p>
