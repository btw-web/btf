<p>For those who are into bike touring, you will know that the classic steel bicycle rack is most commonly used for mounting panniers on multi week to multi year long tours all around the world. </p>



<p>But what about Titanium? Titanium bikes are getting more popular for an alternative to steel for stability, longevity and strength. Ultimately due to being so much lighter weight! But is all this true for bike racks to? Is it really necessary to spend much more money on a Titanium rack? </p>



<p><strong>Do you need titanium racks? Yes, if weight saving is a high priority for your touring needs. In most cases, No! If you plan to do fully loaded touring with 25 kg of gear then saving on a lighter weight rack is not going to be that important. It is also much more expensive buying a titanium rack compared to steel or alloy.</strong> </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at why you should or should not consider titanium racks. And we will finish off this article with some of our favourite Ti racks for touring and even commuting! </p>



<p>Titanium rear racks are a niche category and there is not many front racks at all. Honestly I have my personal worries with this material. That&#8217;s if you plan to haul a heavy amount of gear on the racks. With the lighter mounting equipment in the Ti rack plus fully loaded touring bike gear, it just doesn&#8217;t feel like a good combination. </p>



<p>This is only my own perspective and I can&#8217;t back this up with evidence, but from what I read researching this was one main concern with Titanium racks. </p>



<p>But if you are planning to do light touring or credit card touring, carry much less than a front and rear fully loaded setup. I can see the purpose for a titanium rear rack. Being a lighter weight material than steel. </p>



<p>For example if we take the popular Tubus Logo Evo steel rear rack vs the Tubus Airy titanium rear rack. You can see the difference of 500 grams less weight, with the same max load capacity of 26kg. </p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Steel Rack (Logo Evo)</strong></td><td><strong>Titanium (Airy)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>760 g | 26.8 oz (28&#8221;)</td><td>233 g | 12.7 oz</td></tr><tr><td>Loading</td><td>26 kg | 57.3 lbs</td><td>26 kg | 57.3 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Priced</td><td>$149.99</td><td>$299.99</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>As you can tell there is a huge price difference between the two in this example above. The titanium rear rack is double the cost! Saving a few 100 grams of weight for a Titanium might be perfect for you if you are looking to cut as much weight as you possibly can!</p>



<p>It would make sense if you are just getting into <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/can-you-put-panniers-on-a-road-bike/">longer distance bike adventures on a road bike</a> for example. In this case saving 400 grams, with a titanium rack makes a difference. As a road bikes geometry is not designed to be stable and hold gear on the bike as well as a touring bike can, and the less weight the better. Yes, you can ride a road bike for shorter tours if it is the only bike you have. I actually recommend it, to see if you like touring before you go out and buy a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-touring-bikes-2021/">touring bike</a>. </p>



<p>But for someone like me. Who is riding a 13 kg steel adventure/gravel bike, with a comfortable and longer wheelbase for stability, 400 grams extra weight is barely noticeable. Personally that type of weight difference doesn&#8217;t justify spending twice as much! But wait am I missing something? Let&#8217;s take a deeper look and see what else a titanium rack can offer.</p>



<p>If you are planning to haul near to that 26 kg loading capacity on a regular bases than saving 400 grams is rather worth paying so much more when you could just get a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-rear-bike-rack-for-touring-commuting/">quality steel rack</a>. Titanium racks are best for minimalist touring.</p>



<p>One of the benefits to titanium racks is, they generally won’t rust and you can buff out scratches. Along with being light weight that is about all they have going for them. </p>



<p>Another reason why i wouldn&#8217;t recommend these if you plan to ride fully loaded tours around the globe. If a steel rack breaks at the welds. You can easily rejoin them and get them fixed. Titanium not so much!</p>



<p>Okay let&#8217;s say you think a titanium rack is best for your light and minimalist touring style. Maybe you have a titanium touring bike and are looking for a titanium rack to match? Then here are some of the best titanium rear bike racks, we recommend! It is a rather limited and niche market Tubus make the Airy which is the only real option other than custom build racks. </p>



<h2>Tubus Airy Titanium Rack</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="525" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-3631.jpeg?resize=700%2C525&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6746" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-3631.jpeg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-3631.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-3631.jpeg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Tubus Airy titanium rack was the first titanium rack of its kind. And is a preferred choice. It was the first carrier in the world made out of the very hard to process material titanium. This rack is setting records! With a carrying capacity to weight ratio that is unbeaten. For a rack that weighs 233 grams and a max load capacity of 26 kg/57.3 lbs, it is a great choice. The rack is not only very light and high-tensile, it is also extremely resistant to atmospheric attacks. Priced at $299.99</p>



<h2>Lynskey Titanium Rear Cargo Rack</h2>
