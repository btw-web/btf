<p>When you hear of a adventure bike or gravel bike you often don&#8217;t combined the vision of fenders or mudguards in this picture. But the more I think about it the more it seems like a good idea to get a pair for your biking adventures. Especially if you are riding on some tough, dirty and wet conditions. </p>



<p>As it seems, some would like to keep that grim off you and the bike. But are they really necessary? And lets not forget what the overall appeal of the bike would be. If you are one who cares for a good looking bike and really nice aesthetics. Then you might think that fenders may make your bike look rather &#8216;silly&#8217;! But then there is also the issue of tire clearance. Adventure bikes often have much wider tires then a touring bike. So would normally road touring fenders do the job?</p>



<p>These are the questions I was asking myself when I was researching for some fender for my Surly Long Haul Trucker that I have built out with 45 mm tires for exploring those wilderness tracks. Lets see if fenders are something that you should look at getting for your adventure bike. </p>



<h2>Should You Get Fenders?</h2>



<p>Lets take a honest look at fenders for your gravel/adventure bike and see if they are really worth getting. From my personal experience with fenders, I did use them briefly on a road touring bike, back when I was getting started in this world of bike travel. but I could not really be bothered with the fiddle factor that some talk about. And they do take a little while to get used to mounting on your bike. If you are travelling all over the world and require to make your bike down this can get annoying, trust me. It is just two less things to pack for travel. </p>



<p>But is the benefits that they offer really worth the hassle? Well this can depend on ones opinion, but lets find out. One of the bigger problems I see with the idea of using fenders on a off-road bike is the potential for debris to get caught between the tire and the fender. especially if you are riding on some muddy conditions, there is a great possibility that mud is going to get stuck in the fender and clogging up so much that it can prevent your from riding any further. Requiring you to stop and clean out the debris. </p>



<p>Also depending on how your adventure bike is setup with bike bags and other gear. It might act as a fender in a way of keeping mud off you. Generally rear panniers on touring bikes do a okay job of keeping water from hitting your back. But it comes down to you and if you like the tough look of a mud coated bike. I must say it look pretty badass. But for keeping you dry and mud free I can see the purpose for using fenders, and for off-road it seems even more purposeful. </p>



<p>If you are one for keeping your bike cleaner, then fenders are a great solution. If you have a brand new adventure bike, you probably want it to last. And keeping it clean from mud and other debris fenders help a lot. It seems fenders are better for gravel bikes specifically compared to more adventure bikes and the varied terrain and conditions that will be expected. Such as mud, rocks, roots, sticks, etc. So it is probably best to keep fenders and mudguards off the bike for this type of adventures. This is my opinion and that is what I would do anyway. </p>



<p>It seems fenders have no real purpose when it is raining and you are all ready wet. But they seem to work best and offer the best use when it is not raining and the road surface is wet. Keeping road grime and dirt off your bike. But if you are riding a gravel bike my guess is that you are not worried about a little bit of grime on your bike. </p>

<p>In terms of the looks, the Masi Speciale Randonneur has pulled off a great look in my opinion with nice big fenders. This bike runs <strong>650b x 47c road plus</strong> and it manages very well with fenders. </p>



<p>The problem I see with installing fenders on a adventure bike. As they run wider tires is the possibility to get the right match with the fender width that fits in your bike frame and the tire width with the right amount of clearance. For example with my Surly LHT. I am running WTB Riddler 45C tires with the bike being able to fit up to 45 mm without fenders. So fenders would not fit my bike with the current tire size. As the Surly is only capable of housing up to 700c x 42mm tires with fenders. So make sure to look up your bikes recommended tire clearance. The Surly LHT is designed to be a touring bike. Some more modern adventure bikes and gravel bikes are able to accommodate wider tires with fenders. </p>



<p><strong>How much clearance do you need on bike fenders?</strong></p>



<p>Ideally you should have, about 30 mm between the tire and the bridges or fork crown. Even something like 20 mm and above is manageable. Having a nice clearance up to 30 mm will work great for debris like sticks that would fall away rather than jam in the gap. </p>



<p>I hear some people being able to fit fenders with only 5mm of clearance between the tire and frame. This is pushing it to becoming close to unsafe. This about the clearance I currently have on my Surly. Maybe even 4mm if I am correct. Fitting fenders on a setup with this little clearance is not recommended. The worst thing you would want is having your tire running so close to the fender that it contacts. </p>



<p>Maybe you want to get a pair of fenders if you are commuting and you ride a gravel or adventure bike. This seems like the most likely reason for using fenders on such bikes, because who wants to get muddy before work or school? Right?</p>



<p>If you are worried about if fenders will be able to mount on your bike with the lack of eyelets there are options out there that mount simply to your frame with out then need for braze-ons. </p>



<p>They have there place and are purposeful for keeping your bike clean and stopping debris from spreading over you and your bikes parts, like gears. If you still think fender and mudguards are something that you are looking for then below is a list of some of the best gravel bike and adventure bike fenders. </p>
