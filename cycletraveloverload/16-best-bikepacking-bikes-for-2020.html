<p>Since bikepacking is the type of riding that is gravel, off-road and epic terrains, one requires a bike to be able to stand up to the demands of such riding. </p>



<p>What should I look for in a Bikepacking bike?</p>



<p>I personally have been looking for a bikepacking bike and considering the options. For something that is purpose built for bikepakcing. I currently have a Surly Long Haul Trucker that I have built to suit adventure cycling conditions. But I feel I am missing out on what a true bikepacking bike is all about. </p>



<p>I have been researching what exactly to look for when considering a bikepacking bike. First thing is the bikes material. You can get bikepacking bikes in carbon, titanium, aluminum and steel. And all have their own benefits. </p>



<p>Furthermore it would be great if the bike came with&nbsp;lots of mounting points for water bottles and cargo cages for extra storage. A large front frame triangle would be great allowing space for a frame bag. Large tyre clearance is always great. Suspension although not required is another factor that some bikepacking bikes have. </p>



<h4>Kona Sutra LTD &#8211; $2199</h4>
