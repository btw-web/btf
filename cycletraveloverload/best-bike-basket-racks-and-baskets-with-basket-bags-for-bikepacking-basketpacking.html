<p>When it comes to bikepacking there a many different ways to go about packing. And that is one of the things I love most about it apart from the adventure. And that is the personally we give our bikes through the unique combination of bikepacking gear we put on our bikes. It is like a art, when putting together a rig. </p>



<p>One of these unique ways to cart your gear is in the form of baskets, or basket racks. Usually used at the front of the bike, with a basket bag the is designed to attach nicely to the basket for storing whatever you need for your adventures. </p>



<p>I must admit I really like some of the rigs with baskets running in the front. It really gives off those retro, old school vibes. But just because it is &#8220;dated&#8221; does not mean it is useless. One first thought it may seem like a add suggestion to get a basket installed on your adventure bike? But when it offers such versatility and practicality on even some of the most toughest off-road technical terrain you have to be sold on the idea! </p>



<p>If you are thinking about getting a basket installed on your off-road touring bike you will need to consider mounting and how it will fit on your bike. Most bike baskets are just that sold as a basket only and will require you to buy a seperate front rack. Something like the Surly 8-Pack Rack, Surly 24-pack, a porteur rack or <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/12-best-front-bike-racks-for-touring-bikepacking/">some with a flat top for sitting a basket on</a>. Or you can even get a basket rack. Like the Blackburn Local Basket which is exactly what the name suggests. All in one system where you don&#8217;t have to consider buying two separate parts but get the basket and rack built in together. </p>



<p>This does bring up the cost. You are going to have more components to this type of bike storage system them something simple like a bikepacking drybag handlebar roll. This generally means more expensive. Let&#8217;s do a quick cost break down shall we? Baskets are not that expensive and the Wald 139 only costs $28.99 more on that soon. Then you will have to consider buying basket bag (which can cost anywhere from $175 to $300). Although not necessary, but recommended. You can get away with other dry bags that you might already have. And you can just even store your gear directly into the basket in the summer months. It helps to get something like this Velo Orange Bungee Cord Cargo Net ($20.00) to fit over the top to keep gear inside the basket while shredding gnarly single tracks. And then you want to consider a rack for supporting the basket. The cost for a front rack might not be considered extra cost if you want a front rack to run <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/complete-list-of-the-best-bikepacking-panniers-and-micro-panniers/">panniers</a>. But still a cost to consider. Any where from $90 to $150 is a general price to expect to pay for a front rack.</p>



<p>I like to do comparisons on this site. So if we total all these expenses it comes to a total of just under $300 for basket, rack, and basket bag. This is on the low end of more expensive options. While a typical <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-handlebar-bags-for-bikepacking-with-some-bike-touring-options/">front bikepacking handlebar roll dry bag system</a> can cost as low as $60 up to $200 and more. So it is obviously so much cheaper options then a basket setup. But what we are yet to cover some of the reasons why a basket setup is probably better!</p>



<p>When it comes to volume a basket gets you around something like 22 L and a dry bag can vary but on average you get 15 to 18L storage capacity. But with basket packing some basket bags can hold up to 28 L. Along with generally basket being able to store more gear. You get the versatility, it can be used to cart firewood from forest to camp, pizza boxes, any kind of odd shaped items too while commuting. With the large area you can chuck just about anything in the basket and be on your way. That is not so possible with a drybag system and these often require lightweight items carried in the front as these bags can sag.</p>



<p>Also with a basket setup they are similar to a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/randonneur-bags-and-racks/">rando bag and rack setup</a>. But rando bags and racks often require a specialised rack with mid-eyelets on the fork which only limits to types of bikes that have a type of fork with mounting points in the correct place with a larger rack. #Basketpacking could be stated as a more modern take on rando bags, but they both work. It could be said that baskets like the Wald offer a more stable platform that traditional randonneuring racks lack.</p>



<h2>Wald 139 or 137 Front Basket</h2>

<p>When it comes to #basketpacking there is really only one basket that is almost a industry leader in this space. That being Wald with their 139 front basket. There are some other basket options that I will get to later if you want something a little different. </p>



<p>This is honestly the basket I would recommend the most. It is a very niche market and Wald are just simply dominating with their Front Baskets. </p>



<p>They have so many different basket options and designs to suit most. There two popular style for basket packing is the 139 and the 137. The 137 is considerably smaller than the 139. And when you are bikepacking the more storage the better in my opinion. Just makes for a more capable rig. The 139 measures out to be 15 3/4 in (400 mm) width x 10 1/2 in (266 mm) length x 6 (150 mm) height. If you are looking for a basket for adventure cycling the 139 would be ideal and if you are mostly using for commuting then you might want the 137 as the smaller size is perfect for storing; lunch and a change of clothing. </p>

<p>A well made and sturdy basket once mounted it stays secure it is secure and stiff on bike not bending or moving about. The basket does add some noticed weight to the front of the bike that you will feel, which is expected with a basket of this size &amp; wire thickness. But if you are adventure cycling you should be used to this by know Ie. bike bags and other gear on bike. The basket weighs over 650 grams just for the basket not including hardware, rack, bag and all the extras. <a href="https://amzn.to/3dHw45S">Priced at $28.99</a></p>
