<p>Are you looking for the perfect gravel bike? With great tire clearance, great components, comfortable geometry and adventure ready? Maybe even carbon and lightweight, but not essential. It also has to be a great price? </p>



<p>We have searched all over the web to find the best value gravel bikes money can buy. Value for us is all the above traits but for a price that seems too good to be true. </p>



<p>What makes the best &#8216;value&#8217; gravel bike?</p>



<p>Decent Components </p>



<p>The quality of components is not really the most important. Most bike companies include decent enough components on their bikes. Where it matter most and you get the best value is with a climbing gear that is close to MTB performance. You will struggle to find a gravel bike with a 18&#8243; climbing gear which is standard for a MTB. But a gravel bike with 20&#8243; to 23&#8243; is perfect for climbing hills when you have gear on your bike. Anything larger than this makes it difficult and you can expect more hike a bike. </p>



<p>Adventure Ready</p>



<p>This is a rather loose fitting term. But it can define just about any part of a bike that is optimised for adventure cycling. Here at Cycle Travel Overload we are all about adventure on bikes. So a value gravel bike for us, means a bike with heaps of braze-ons or eyelets for mounting racks, and other gear. Making your bike more versatile and allow for self-sufficiency while exploring for days or weeks on end. </p>



<p>Also wide enough stock tires, typically anything over 45mm is great for exploring off the beaten track with gear. Personally the fatter the better. Which leads me to the next point. </p>



<p>Huge Tire Clearance</p>



<p>With a majority of gravel bikes, they often don&#8217;t have the biggest tire clearances. Maybe lucky to fit max 45mm tires on the frame. But for extra comfort and making your bike more capable at tackling tougher terrain. A bike that has the ability to fit 2.4&#8243; or even up to 2.8&#8243; wide tires is value for money. Even 2.1&#8243; is nice to have on. gravel bike. It literally allows your bike to pretty much go anywhere with relative ease. </p>



<p>Comfortable Geometry </p>



<p>This is subjective but for us who like to explore having a gravel bike with a more upright riding position, say with a stack/reach ratio of 1.5 or more allows for better comfort for long days in the saddle. Also a geometry more suited to adventure riding helps. More stable frame designs make it more comfortable to ride with gear on bike. </p>

<h3>2021 Poseidon Redwood</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="436" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Poseidon-Redwood-Gravel-Bike-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C436&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7213" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Poseidon-Redwood-Gravel-Bike-1.jpeg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Poseidon-Redwood-Gravel-Bike-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Poseidon-Redwood-Gravel-Bike-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C465&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Poseidon-Redwood-Gravel-Bike-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>According to our calculations the best value gravel bike for 2021 goes to the Poseidon Redwood! Coming in at a whopping $899.99 it has so much going on for this price. With the Advent X&nbsp;group-set that&#8217;s just about as good a quality for bikes priced up to $1,500! It provides one of the best climbing gears (21.88″) for comparable gravel bikes, thanks to the Prowheel&nbsp;38t Narrow Wide Crank&nbsp;and Microshift&nbsp;11-48T Advent X&nbsp;10 Speed cassette. </p>



<p>Personally huge tire clearance is where the value comes. As this bike can clear a 2.5&#8243; tire with no problems. Largest tire clearance compared to all other gravel bikes we looked at. This gives you so much off-road options. You can just about ride this anywhere, with a good MTB tire. </p>



<p>It is however an alloy build weighing in at approximately 12.5 kg. Which is certainly nothing to turn your nose up too. The 6061 Aluminum Double Heat Treated frameset is backed by their lifetime warranty and stress tested to handle whatever punishment that you are willing to give this bike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not to mention other parts like the Poseidon Adventure Bars&nbsp;with 24 Degree Flare, for off-road comfort in the drops. I am mind-blown with how much value is packed into <a href="https://www.poseidonbike.com/products/redwood?variant=35715148513431">this bike</a> for that sub $900 price! It is truely ridiculous!! </p>



<h3>Breezer RADAR Expert</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="448" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-RADAR-EXPERT-2019-9.jpeg?resize=720%2C448&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7216" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-RADAR-EXPERT-2019-9.jpeg?w=1494&amp;ssl=1 1494w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-RADAR-EXPERT-2019-9.jpeg?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-RADAR-EXPERT-2019-9.jpeg?resize=1024%2C637&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-RADAR-EXPERT-2019-9.jpeg?resize=768%2C478&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-RADAR-EXPERT-2019-9.jpeg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-RADAR-EXPERT-2019-9.jpeg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Our second best value gravel bike goes to the Radar Expert by Breezer! Their 2021 model is around $1,200 but 2020&#8217;s was sub $1,000! But if you are after one of the best value steel gravel bikes this is worth the look. Let&#8217;s be real, steel is real! A dream material for adventure riding, and yes in most cases heavier. But the Radar Expert comes in at around 12.8 kg which is not much more than the Alloy Redwood. Read our review <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/breezer-radar-expert-review-best-budget-gravel-bike/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Slightly more upright riding positioning compared to the more racer stack/reach ratio of the Redwood. The Radar Expert has a 1.57, a 23.27&#8243; climbing gear and max tire clearance for 29 x 2.2″ it&#8217;s still a very capable adventure gravel bike. I personally love last years yellow not sure about the 2021 dark red and white colour choices. Although I think they also have a green and white which would be my choice for the 2021 model. <a href="https://www.breezerbikes.com/bikes/adventure/radar/radar-expert">What do you think?</a> If you have more of a budget and want bigger tire clearance I would check out the <a href="https://www.breezerbikes.com/bikes/adventure/radar/radar-x">Radar X</a></p>



<h3>2021 Masi Giramondo 700c</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="433" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Masi-Giramondo-700c-Raw_5000x-1.png?resize=720%2C433&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7219" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Masi-Giramondo-700c-Raw_5000x-1.png?w=2054&amp;ssl=1 2054w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Masi-Giramondo-700c-Raw_5000x-1.png?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Masi-Giramondo-700c-Raw_5000x-1.png?resize=1024%2C615&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Masi-Giramondo-700c-Raw_5000x-1.png?resize=768%2C461&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Masi-Giramondo-700c-Raw_5000x-1.png?resize=1536%2C923&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Masi-Giramondo-700c-Raw_5000x-1.png?resize=2048%2C1230&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Masi-Giramondo-700c-Raw_5000x-1.png?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Masi-Giramondo-700c-Raw_5000x-1.png?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Masi Giramondo takes third spot mostly thanks to its touring bike gear range. This bike is a mixed bag, it could be considered a touring bike cross gravel bike or adventure gravel bike, how does that sound? So I thought it was still would including in this post. So why is is one of the best value gravel bikes? It comes stock out of the box with Tubus Tara low-rider front rack &amp; Tubus Cargo rear rack. Ready for panniers and an adventure around the world! This modern day touring bike has geometry designed for hours of comfortable riding. This means a 1.55 stack/reach ratio for upright riding comfortability. </p>



<p>It even has bar-end shifters for reliability and easy adjustment. Tubeless compatible Brev. M 700c rims with 23mm internal width, and tire clearance up 29 x 2.0&#8243;. You even get the option for Dynamo wire routing on the frame if you ever want one. It is a little on the heavier side at 32.0 lbs / 14.5 kg. They have some nice colours from previous models, but I don&#8217;t mind the &#8216;raw steel&#8217; look. </p>



<h3>2020 Diamondback Haanjo 5C EXP Carbon</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="422" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/374ec-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C422&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7221" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/374ec-1.jpeg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/374ec-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/374ec-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C450&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/374ec-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>A more expensive bike than some of the more budget friendly gravel bike options out there. The Haanjo 5C from Diamondback is one of the best value carbon gravel bikes you can buy. (Priced at $2,000) If lighter weight bike builds is what your after the Haanjo 5C EXP is a fierce contender. Weighing in at 21.8 lbs or 9.88 kg. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/cheapest-carbon-gravel-bikes/">Looking for the cheapest carbon gravel bikes?</a></p>



<p>For your average gravel bike the Haanjo 5C stacks up very well with a decent 22.82&#8243; granny gear for climbing, and max tire clearance for up to 2.1&#8243; tires. It is a capable gravel bike but also ready for more loaded tours if that is what you have in mind. Thanks to eyelets for rear and front racks its set to take anything you need with you. It would have been nice to have Hydraulic disc brakes instead of mechanical, but for the price I think this is asking a bit. </p>



<h3>2021 Cannondale Topstone 4</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="410" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fbbbd-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C410&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7223" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fbbbd-1.jpeg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fbbbd-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fbbbd-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C438&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fbbbd-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Another well priced gravel bike from a big brand, the Topstone by Cannondale. Offers an all-round, all-road gravel bike at $1,150. You get the same 1 x 10 microSHIFT Advent X groupset as the Redwood. But on a bike with less tire clearance and overall adventure capabilities in comparison. But let&#8217;s not talk this bike down completely. You do get a full carbon fork with the light, durable SmartForm C2 Alloy Frame. Making the bike weigh around 9.9 Kg. If you want a light gravel bike but want to pay as little as possible, this is probably one of the better options. Almost an identical weight to the $850 more expensive Haanjo 5C. </p>



<p>It even has one of the better climbing gears at 22.74 gear inches. Where it falls short for us is the limited tire clearance. Comes with 700c x 37 tires and a max clearance for up to 40mm or 650b x 48mm. </p>

<p>The Marin Nicasio + is up there with one of the most bang for buck gravel bikes on the market. After all it only costs around $1,000. I personally got this bike to test out and can report back that it is a good riding gravel bike for the money. It is a little limited if you want huge tire clearances, with the ability to fit 650b x&nbsp;47mm max tires. It does come with the WTB Horizon, 650B x 47mm and there is not much more room for anything wider, except for some mud to clear. </p>



<p>The 1 x 9 MicroSHIFT Advent, FSA groupset works okay but can be sloppy at times. It gives you an acceptable 24.15″ climbing gear which is still better then something like the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bikepacking-setups-codeys-kona-sutra-ltd-2020/">Kona Sutra LTD</a>. Weighing about the same at 13kg. The Nicasio + is a full steel build gravel bike which is what had me interested. It has been a fun bike to ride and for the price it is a bargain. </p>



<h3>2021 State Bicycle Co 4130 All-Road</h3>

<p>For the most affordable bike in this list and just about the cheapest gravel bike that offers enough value to be considered good. The State Bicycles All-Road is a must to consider. Yes it doesn&#8217;t have the best groupset (1&#215;11 Sensah SRX Pro) or easiest granny gear for climbing (27.19″) no thanks to the 42T crank. But it is the bike I would recommend if you are looking for your first bike and want the cheapest possible gravel bike. </p>



<p>A full steel build weighing in at 12.59 kg. The Co 4130 All-Road, allows for upgrades at checkout if you want a better saddle or pedals. It performs just as well with 650b or 700c wheels. With either 650b x 2.1″ or 700c x 38c, and a max tire clearance for up to those 650b x 2.1″ wheels. <a href="https://www.statebicycle.com/products/4130-all-road-sonoran-tan-650b-700c">See what people are saying.</a></p>



<h3>2021 Specialized Diverge Comp E5 EVO</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="523" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Specialized-Diverge-2000x1333-3.jpeg?resize=720%2C523&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7235" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Specialized-Diverge-2000x1333-3.jpeg?w=1758&amp;ssl=1 1758w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Specialized-Diverge-2000x1333-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Specialized-Diverge-2000x1333-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C744&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Specialized-Diverge-2000x1333-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C558&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Specialized-Diverge-2000x1333-3.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1117&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Specialized-Diverge-2000x1333-3.jpeg?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Specialized-Diverge-2000x1333-3.jpeg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>You know we had to fit a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-flat-bar-gravel-bikes/">flat bar gravel bike</a> in here! The all new Specialized flat bar gravel bike has to be a personal favourite at the moment. You could say this bike is redefining the notion of gravel grinding.</p>



<p>When it comes to the bikes geometry it is more progressive then the new drop bar Diverge. With an increase in the reach, slackened head tube and lowered the bottom bracket, resulting in a rather planted feeling.</p>



<p>The bike is MTB inspired, with a 1 x 12 high end level XT, Praxis groupset, hydraulic disc brakes and a dropper post. Built around an alloy frame and carbon fork. Rolling on some 700x42mm tires, you get max clearance for 47mm with a 700c wheel and 2.1” with a 650b wheel. You also get a Praxis Zayante carbon 1X, 40T crank and Shimano XT, 12-speed, 10-45t cassette. Which provides a 26.41&#8243; climbing gear. </p>



<h3>2021 Norco Search XR A Suspension</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="402" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/my21_search_xr_a_suspension_yellow_black-full-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C402&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7237" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/my21_search_xr_a_suspension_yellow_black-full-1.jpeg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/my21_search_xr_a_suspension_yellow_black-full-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/my21_search_xr_a_suspension_yellow_black-full-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C572&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/my21_search_xr_a_suspension_yellow_black-full-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C429&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/my21_search_xr_a_suspension_yellow_black-full-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Rounding out the list for the best value gravel bikes is the Norco Search XR A Suspension. Yes you heard right, a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-suspension-best-hardtail-full-suspension-gravel-bikes/">suspension gravel bike</a>. It has to be the best value gravel bike with a suspension fork. The SR Suntour GVX Gravel with 50mm travel and Lockout. The 40T by 11-42 T 1&#215;11 GRX 800, GRX 600 groupset gives you a 26.26&#8243; climbing gear. With 700c x 40 and also rather limited tire clearance up to 700c x 42mm for the frame and 700c x 45mm for the fork. </p>



<p>This bike doesn&#8217;t really boast too much value for the price which is why it slip in at the bottom of the list. But because it comes stock with a suspension fork it deserved a spot. Another option might be to add a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-suspension-best-hardtail-full-suspension-gravel-bikes/">suspension fork</a> to your current gravel bike or a better value gravel bike option. </p>
