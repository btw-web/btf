<p>There are a variety of different camping stoves out there. When selecting on for your next bike tour or bikepacking adventure. You need to consider weight and volume the stove takes up in your bike bags, just like any other bit of gear. </p>



<p>I have been using the <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2YU6P99">Trangia Small Ultralight Aluminium Camp Stove with Kettle (check the price here on Amazon)</a> </strong>for over 2 years now. It is fantastic as it allows you to cook up some decent home style meals while travelling through the most remote corners of the earth. The model I have also includes a kettle, so you can make coffee or tea. </p>



<p>The Trangia, is a very neat design, and compact storage and packing solution for the bicycle traveller. A quality product that is guaranteed to stand the test of time. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1689" height="950" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-5.png?fit=720%2C405" alt="" class="wp-image-805" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-5.png?w=1689&amp;ssl=1 1689w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-5.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-5.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-5.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-5.png?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p>Above is everything you can expect to get with the Trangia stove. </p>



<ul><li>Ultralight Aluminium upper and lower windshield</li><li>2 x ultralight aluminium 1L saucepans</li><li>1 x 18cm ultralight aluminium frypan</li><li>1 x ultralight aluminium kettle 600ml</li><li>Spirit burner with simmer ring control</li></ul>



<p>When I review and give my opinion about gear and products, I strive to tell the full story. I am going to be honest and share what are some of the negatives and things you may want to consider before purchasing. </p>



<p><strong>Be Careful Not to Burn Your EG25 Washer</strong></p>



<p>This is user error on my part. But if you don&#8217;t use the washer underneath the lid to seal whatever liquids you may have left over in the spirit burner. It will leak into your bowls and make dinner taste awful for next time. </p>



<p>I had missed place my simmer ring control piece and was just using the lid. Sitting it half on the burner for simmering. This was very silly and caused the rubber washer to burn. As I was out in the middle of nowhere I had trouble getting a new washer. When you but the Trangia new it includes a spare washer, for your connivence. Don&#8217;t be silly like me. </p>



<p><strong>The Skillet is Okay!</strong></p>



<p>This also could be user error. But the skillet or frypan which also acts ar the lid of the kit when packed away. It seems to stick to food after too many time cooking. Maybe I was not using enough oil, I am not sure. But when I try to cook my vegan sausages they just stick like poo to a blanket. This is probably the only negative I can think of this cooking set. </p>



<p><strong>Maybe a Bit Heavy</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1689" height="950" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-11.png?fit=720%2C405" alt="" class="wp-image-807" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-11.png?w=1689&amp;ssl=1 1689w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-11.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-11.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-11.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-11.png?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p>Depending on the type of bicycle touring you plan to do. This kit maybe to heavy and take up too much room in your panniers. If you are really cutting it for weight, like bikepacking it is probably not best suited for that. It weighs 998 grams and is about 18 cm in diameter by 10.5 cm tall when packed.  </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Cooks Appose to Just Boil Water</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1689" height="950" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-8.png?fit=720%2C405" alt="" class="wp-image-806" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-8.png?w=1689&amp;ssl=1 1689w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-8.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-8.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-8.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Untitled-design-8.png?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p>Being able to cook great meals is one of the things I love most about the Trangia. Some stoves only allow you to really just heat up some water and add it to noodles or something like that. But with a Trangia the sky is the limit with the potential possibilities of recipes. </p>



<h2>Recipe Ideas For Bicycle Touring</h2>



<p>Learning the art of cooking quality and amazingly tasting food while bicycle touring, can be quite the challenge. </p>



<p>You don&#8217;t have many of the luxuries that you get in a standard home kitchen. No fridge or oven can be it quite tough. You really need to think outside of the box, if you wish to create some incredible food. </p>



<p>Tara has published <strong><a href="https://getdpd.com/cart/hoplink/30370?referrer=2k06r2u3ns2sokgwg48&amp;p=175915">&#8216;Bike Camp Cook&#8217; </a></strong>which is a course and a recipe book. That teaches you the ins and outs to the craft of cooking stunning meals while cycle touring all over the world. </p>

<p>The great thing about this cookbook for bike travellers. As I am vegan, there are some Vegan recipes included. To accommodate for all the herbivores out there. Of the 50 recipes in the book, 17 are vegan, and about 8 more could easily be made vegan </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://getdpd.com/cart/hoplink/30370?referrer=2k06r2u3ns2sokgwg48&amp;p=175915"><img loading="lazy" width="512" height="412" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/unnamed.jpg?resize=512%2C412" alt="" class="wp-image-925" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/unnamed.jpg?w=512&amp;ssl=1 512w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/unnamed.jpg?resize=300%2C241&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></figure></div>



<p><strong>Stealthy Flame</strong></p>



<p>When you are camping you will not draw attention to yourself. As the light signature is very small on this camp stove. </p>



<p><strong>Fuel Availability</strong></p>



<p>One of the most attractive things about this stove is that you can just about get access to fuel anywhere in the world. Anything with a flammable enough alcohol content should work fine. Denatured alcohol and some rubbing alcohol will do the job, which can be found in pharmacies or hardware stores. I typically use Methylated Spirits for my Trangia. </p>



<p><strong>Works in Most Conditions</strong></p>



<p>Even in very extreme weather conditions, this stove is adaptable. In snow, rain, and wind, it still manages to stay alight and will work. It does loose a little bit of heat and flame size when in very heavy direct winds, but the overall design helps to guard the wind enough. </p>
