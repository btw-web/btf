<p>But first for those of you that don&#8217;t know, what are Jone H Bars?

<p>These bars are intended to be used for touring on paved and unpaved roads. But they are also suited to gravel grinding as well. The widest point of these bars are 67cm. This creates rather good control on rough surfaces and around town. The Bullhorn section of the bars provide a streamlined position for smoother roads and headwinds. Theses Crazy bars have different bar area sizes. The main bar is 22.2mm so MTB grips, levers, and shifters fit. The “horns” are 23.8mm, so road levers – including inverse levers – fit, as do bar-end shifters. Clamp area is 25.4mm. Made from 6061 aluminum and heat treated, these bars weigh around 450 grams and you also get a 45 degree sweep. Priced from $75.00</p>



<h2>On-One Mickey Handlebar</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="311" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/HBOOMKB_P1-01.jpg?resize=720%2C311&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4413" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/HBOOMKB_P1-01.jpg?w=950&amp;ssl=1 950w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/HBOOMKB_P1-01.jpg?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/HBOOMKB_P1-01.jpg?resize=768%2C331&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/HBOOMKB_P1-01.jpg?resize=50%2C22&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The availability of some of these bars will be much harder to find. These are available in the UK from Planet X and for a rather cheap price. It has much less sweep then the Jones bar at 9 degrees. But it is a supremely comfortable low rise, MTB style flat bar that has been transformed into the perfect Touring, Bike Packing and Adventure riding handlebar. If you are someone who prefers a more flat MTB bar setup compared to a drop bar then the On-One Mickey bars might be a great choice for you. It has easy ergonomics, plenty of width for the broadest shoulders and front facing luggage bar it&#8217;s perfect for any bikepacking or cycle touring adventure. Has a rise of 14 mm, the bar weighs in at 476 grams and you get a handlebar that is 760mm wide. Priced from only <strong>£24.99</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately could not find much information about these handlebars, as the sales pages really aren&#8217;t that descriptive. But some bike travellers recommend using these bars as a replacement for the Jones H Bars. Offering a 50mm forward sweep and a 30 to 40 degrees back sweep (had different numbers from Amazon and offical website). Weighing in at 340 grams. You get the option for 31.8mm or 25.4mm mounting options. Priced on Amazon from $55.00. But don&#8217;t take my word for it. <a href="https://amzn.to/2QsV6vU">Read the reviews here.</a></p>



<h2>Titec&nbsp;J-Bar</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="267" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/s-l1600-1.jpg?resize=720%2C267&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4419" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/s-l1600-1.jpg?w=876&amp;ssl=1 876w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/s-l1600-1.jpg?resize=300%2C111&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/s-l1600-1.jpg?resize=768%2C285&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/s-l1600-1.jpg?resize=50%2C19&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>These handlebars are harder to find for sale online, I had some luck finding a couple listings here and there on eBay but somewhere like Amazon they are out of stock. So supply for this handlebar is rather limited. But still worth mentioning in this article as they are another alternative option to the Jones H Bars. Made form a 6061-T6 Drawn &amp; butted tapered welded tubing. The bars width is 660mm (26 inches). You get a 45° sweep on outside grip extensions. And the handlebars weigh in at 440 grams. They sell MSRp for $90, the one I found new on eBay was $70.</p>
