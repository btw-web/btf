<p><strong>So do you want to get into bicycle touring? Maybe you’re a beginner cyclist?</strong></p>



<p>This is my story and this is how I got into bicycle touring. Pretty much started my first tour in the USA. But when I flew over to the states I didn’t have the intention to cycle across the country. When I was presented the opportunity I was in. And the whole idea of bicycle touring made complete sense. I realised that it is a great way to see a place and since then I’ve been hooked on the idea of bicycle travel. I want to further this way of travel, as a lifestyle. I’ve also been to Japan and cycled across Australia. While also having plans to do Europe as well.</p>

<h3>But what is bicycle touring?</h3>



<p>According to WIKIPEDIA</p>



<p><strong>Bicycle touring</strong>&nbsp;means self-contained&nbsp;<strong>cycling</strong>&nbsp;trips for pleasure, adventure, and autonomy rather than sport, commuting, or exercise.&nbsp;<strong>Touring</strong>&nbsp;can range from single-to multi-day trips, even years.&nbsp;<strong>Tours</strong>&nbsp;may be planned by the participant or organised by a holiday business, a club, or a charity as a fund-raising venture.</p>



<h3>What types of bicycle touring is there?</h3>



<p>There is a range of different ways you can do bicycle touring; from <strong>day touring</strong> to <strong>overnight touring</strong>, even <strong>credit card touring</strong>, <strong>light touring</strong>. Well also not specifically bicycle touring but<strong> bikepacking </strong>/ cyclocamping. <strong>Guided group tours</strong>. There’s also <strong>guided self-supported tours</strong> and your most common <strong>self-supported bicycle tour</strong>.<br>There is a multitude of various ways to travel by bicycle but these are the main ways that I found.</p>



<h3>Different types of bicycles?</h3>



<p>There are many different bicycles that can be used to undertake a cycle tour. Including <strong>Road bikes</strong>, <strong>touring bikes</strong>, <strong>recumbent bikes</strong>, <strong>folding bikes</strong> like the Brompton, <strong>cyclocross bikes</strong>, <strong>expedition bikes</strong> or <strong>mountain bikes</strong> often used for bikepacking.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/bicycletraveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Defy_3_compact_black-1024x682.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="" class="wp-image-329" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption>This is the <strong>road bike</strong> I used for my first ever attempt at touring. These types of bike are best for short day / overnight of even a few day tours on pathed roads. They are typically not used for anything longer as they are not appropriate for a standard length touring. The tyres are often to skinny and in some cases they do not provide the option for racks. But having that said this Giant Deft 3 (2014) does give you the possibility for attaching racks. <br></figcaption></figure>

<p>While there is a variety of different bikes that you can use. If you are just getting started and want to test out Bicycle touring. Say for a couple of days you can really use any bike that you do have. But if you’re looking to do this long term then it’s worth looking into a proper set up such as a touring bike.</p>

<h3>How to carry your gear on your bike?</h3>



<p>The most common way to carry gear on your bicycle is with panniers. You can also use bike packing bags if you choose to carry much less stuff. Possibly for a week in length but typically anything long, will require a set of rear panniers and front panniers. That are fixed to your bike with the use of racks, you may use other bicycle bags such as frame bags and saddle bags to store your gear. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/bicycletraveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1812fke_ORTLIEB_WEB_Front_Panniers-1024x612.jpg?resize=720%2C430" alt="" class="wp-image-335" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<p>One way <strong>not </strong>to carry things on your bike is by using a backpack. Specially for long tours because it could be detrimental to your your health. It’s just uncomfortable in general to be wearing a heavy backpack for extended periods of time. It is preferred to keep all of the weight of your gear on the bike, making the bicycle tour much more comfortable. </p>



<h3>How to pack your panniers &amp; things to keep in mind?</h3>



<p>So packing your panniers is an art in away. First off it might be better to practice packing before you go on your tour. Make sure everything has a place and keep it in that same place when you packet things back in the panniers. So then you don’t lose things and you don’t have to go digging through multiple bags just to find the lip balm. Typically when packing you want to make sure that you distribute the weight. Having most of the weight in the centre of the bike. I’d typically like to have less weight at the front but it comes down to personal preference. Some people say that putting all of the weight on the front helps you control the bike better. Then if you have too much weight at the back you wear out the back tyres. So it’s just better to have an even distribution of weight over the entirety of the bike. Make sure that each pannier is filled up with a similar amount of weight. </p>



<p>Also a question I get asked a lot is &#8220;What do you do with the panniers when you go into the supermarket? Do you leave them on the bike or will you take them all with you?&#8221; Now for the purpose of bringing them all in with you while you shop is quite impractical. The solution that I have found works for me is to store all of your valuables and the things you don’t want stolen in a light backpack that fits inside a pannier. When you have to go shopping just take that backpack out of the panniers and take it with you to the store. Also make sure that you make it hard for your bike to be stolen. Use a relatively secure lock.</p>



<p>From my experience doing this I seem to have no problems. On the note of how much your bike weighs? You really want to make sure that you’re only taking the essentials, that you need. There’s no point taking heaps of things that you’re not going to be using. That takes up space and could be used for other things or could not be used at all. Making your bike lighter and less cumbersome to ride. </p>



<h3>Camping gear to take</h3>



<p>So talking further on the camping gear that you may need for a bicycle tour. A very common way of sleeping is to use a tent. For the tent set up and just with everything else in general. You want to make sure you can get the lightest gear possible. You may want to take into consideration how small the tent packs in relation to how it fits on your bike. Typically I store my tent on the top of the rear rack and I like it to sit in flush from the edge of the rack. It’s just not fun carting around a big tent. </p>



<p>You also need to consider the right sized tent for your situation, you may need a two-person tent if you’re a travelling couple. If you’re a solo traveller you can sleep in a one person tent saving wait carried. </p>



<p>Or a Hammock with a tarp set up, is something that I’ve been looking into possibly doing. I haven’t done it first hand, but I have written a post about <a href="http://bicycletraveller.com/bringing-a-hammock-on-a-bicycle-tour/">taking a Hammock on a bicycle tour.</a> I cover some points there if you’re interested. </p>



<p>You also need a <strong>sleeping bag</strong>,<strong> sleeping bag liner</strong>, <strong>sleeping mat</strong> and a <strong>travel pillow</strong>. With the sleeping bag you also need to consider its packed size as well. It’s very common for sleeping bags to pack very big, taking up a large volume. So once again just make sure that the pack size of the sleeping bag is small enough to fit in a Pannier. Or if it will be attached outside on the top rack with the tent. You also want to consider the temperature rating on a sleeping bag and the climate that you will be travelling in. Make sure that it is an appropriate range for your adventure. Trust me there’s nothing worse than waking up shivering in the middle of the night. </p>



<p>A list of <strong>popular</strong>, <strong>lightweight</strong>, <strong>waterproof</strong>, <strong>durable</strong>, <strong>2 person tents</strong> that other bicycle tourers recommend. </p>

<h3>Cooking gear and advice for cooking on a tour </h3>



<p>So typically you can pick up a light weight backpacker camping stove / hiking stove. Which requires propane fuel. I like to use the Trangia stove, requiring methylated spirits. Which is also another good camping stove from my experience. </p>



<p>Things to consider is the accessibility of purchasing fuel in the country that you’re travelling in. Some remote areas may not have propane tanks and sometimes it may not have methylated spirits. I’ve heard it’s a good idea to get a stove that runs on petrol because obviously there are cars everywhere and you can pick up fuel at any petrol station. </p>



<p>I am able to cook up full vegan meals while I travel on my bike. It is much cheaper to buy groceries and spend some time preparing your own food. </p>



<h2>Planning for your bicycle tour </h2>



<h3>You should know basic bicycle repairs and maintenance </h3>



<p>A good thing to learn before you head off on your bicycle tour, is <strong>basic bicycle maintenance. </strong>You can take a online course or even sometimes bike stores offer a class. You must learn the basic things that you need to know in order to change parts and/or fix your bike. Such as; changing a flat tire maintenance your chain and derailleur, adjusting breaks etc.. You may also need to get some practice in dismantling and putting your bike back together and learning how every part fits back on your bike. </p>



<h3>Get some practice riding your fully loaded bicycle before heading out </h3>



<p>Riding a fully loaded bicycle is much different compared to a light road bike. On my first tour I remember I was adjusted so much for riding on a road bike and it’s super lightweight. Then when you jump on a fully loaded heavy steel framed touring bicycle. It’s a lot different and the handling is much different. Give yourself a couple of days or a week just to ride are your fully loaded touring bike for commuting to the shops. To test out how it feels when it rides, just to let yourself get accustomed to the difference.</p>



<h3>What is the weight of your bike and how does this affect your tour </h3>



<p>So I haven’t properly weighed my bike to know how much it ways. But I know when I checked it in at the airport it’s around 25 to 30 kg. With all of my gear packed into a cardboard box. Typically you don’t want your bike to be any heavier than how ever much you are able to carry for a couple of metres. As you will be required in some instances to pick it up to get it over tough terrain. </p>



<h3>Where do you camp or sleep every night?</h3>



<p>For me personally I try to wild camp and free camp as much as I possibly can. Because, 1: I love the outdoors and being in nature. 2: it’s just cheap for the bank account. Why pay for accommodation when you can get it for free you know? So I try and find a secluded forest area if I can. And just sneak in there for the night. It’s important to be in and out without being seen, just to prevent confrontation. But you can also camp at campgrounds, for no more than $15 &#8211; $20 a night and these places typically have toilets, showers and power. Another possibility is hostiles which are a cheap form of hotels which is also another option. Then you can also stay for free at other peoples houses using platform such as Couch Surfing and Warm Showers. Warm Showers is something that I highly recommend because the people that you’re communicating with our specifically share a interest in bicycle touring. It’s great for conversation and these places typically make you food and you get a shower. If you’re travelling internationally you get to really see how a average Joes house is in a country to get a real feel for the culture.</p>



<h3>What does the average bicycle touring day look like and how much distance should you cover each day?</h3>



<p>So it can vary between each person and where they are travelling. For me personally, I just got back from a Australian tour and in some places you need to cover 100+ kilometres just to get food. Because some places are very remote and there’s nothing in between. Having that said, it’s probably best to ease into it for the first couple of days doing 40 to 50 km and then building up to hundred kilometre per day. The overall average can range anywhere from 50 to 150 km depending on how you feel on the day. </p>



<p>It’s really important to listen to your body and if your body is screaming you need to let it rest. Rest days are important. Your body is working every day, your legs are doing the same movements repetitively and some days you need to just take a complete day off. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lDeRpkDQGg&amp;t=3s">And book a hotel </a>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lDeRpkDQGg&amp;t=3s">just lay in bed all day watching TV or sometimes.</a> I found this is important for the long term to sustain a journey that is more than a couple of months. </p>



<h2>How to prepare for a bicycle tour</h2>



<h3>Live like you’re on a tour!</h3>



<p>A great way to get ready for a bicycle tour is to pretend that you are on a bicycle tour, for a week or so. Cook like you’re on tour, sleep like you’re on tour, set up your tent and everything. Then pack everything away like you are on a tour. Get out your toothbrush and everything like you are on a tour. I think you get the point. Just practice it and you figure out what you need and what you don’t need. Making the adjustment from normal life to bicycle tour mode a bit easier. </p>



<h3>Planning your route and where you want to ride</h3>



<p>For me there is about three ways you can go about this.</p>



<ul><li>You can either ride pre-existing routes.</li><li>Create your own custom routes suited to where you want to start and end your tour. Then in between that will be your interest points of potential locations that you want to visit on your tour. Mixed in with some locations for accommodation such as campgrounds and hotels and you just build the route around that.</li><li>But you can also plan your tour in the way that I like. Leaving room for spontaneity, which isn’t really planning at all it’s more of a vague idea of where you want to specifically go. Sometimes you may find campgrounds that are a days ride away. So you may plan day by day where you would like to end up for the night. Instead of planning the entire tour all at once. I like this way as it leaves a possibility for a range of outcomes and you’re not stuck into one plan if another opportunity arises. Plus I just don&#8217;t like to over plan. </li></ul>



<h3>Figuring out the best roads to ride</h3>



<p>The best way I found is to use Google Street view to just quickly scan over some of the roads that you will be taking. Just to double check and get a glimpse of the road to see if it has a wide enough and safe shoulder. Sometimes I have found from cycling in outback Australia, there is no shoulder at all but that is the only road you can really take. This is an exception. </p>



<p>It’s just important to figure out if there is maybe bicycle paths you could take or rail trails. Instead of taking highways and more dangerous roads so to speak.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope this introduction to bicycle touring has helped you figure the direction you need to take to make your next or first ever bicycle tour a reality. </p>
