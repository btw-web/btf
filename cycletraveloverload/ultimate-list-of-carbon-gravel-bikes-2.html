<p>So you want a carbon gravel bike? Here at Cycle Travel Overload we are mostly about adventuring by bicycle. Carbon is not your most popular material for that. Steel or Titanium is more a go to. </p>



<p>However carbon has its many advantages. The main one being weight reductions. Carbon is simply a lighter material, this allows for some of the gravel bikes in this list to be around 7kg! Comparing my 13kg steel gravel/adventure bike that is a whopping 6 kg in weight saving. </p>



<p>Due to this lighter weight you can ride faster then most other material gravel bikes. </p>



<p>But how strong is a carbon fiber bike? Will a carbon fibre gravel bike be strong enough? These are a few concerns people have when looking for a carbon gravel bike. </p>



<p>The reality is that carbon bikes actually have a strength to weight ratio that is higher than steel. Carbon frame a relatively strong, and hold up to a significant amount of force. Only if it is applied in the direction it was intended. </p>



<p>If strength is a number one priority and you want something that is bomb-proof, steel is best. If you want a bit of both worlds. Strength of steel (or more), and similar (slightly more heavier weight of carbon.) I would recommend looking into a Titanium gravel bike. </p>



<p>This brings our first concern with carbon gravel bikes. They are susceptible to impacts and damage isn’t always visible. But you are more likely to damage a carbon bike, by damage I mean break the frame, then steel. If it does break carbon is much more difficult to repair. </p>



<p>But if you just want the lightest possible gravel bike and want to go nothing but fast! Carbon is your go too. </p>



<p>With carbon frames you can achieve damping qualities and comfort similar to high-end steel and titanium bikes. Not all carbon is created equal. Just because a bike is made from carbon does not mean it’s good quality or suitable for a specific application. </p>



<p>That is why we have done the hard work for you. Below is an ultimate list of carbon gravel bikes. </p>



<p>Our criteria for choosing these bikes, was they had to obviously be a carbon frame. While also only being the newest and most updated models available. They have mid to upper quality components. </p>



<p>Normally we only choose bikes with a 1.5 stack/reach ratio or higher. As this means a more upright seated position making all day riding much more comfortable. But because carbon bikes are often faster this means smaller ratios and more racer riding positions to be more aero on bike. So we still included bikes with as low as 1.4 stack reach ratios. </p>



<p>Also there is no particular budget, so bikes up to $10,000 can be expected in this list. If you want to checkout the best carbon gravel bikes under $2,000. (we have this article in the pipelines, so stay tuned for that). </p>



<p>Also that brings me to another thing to consider about carbon gravel bikes. They can be expensive. Due to all the weight saving you pay for it. </p>

<p>The first bike is the 2020 Ibis Hakka MX. Which comes in the GRX and Rival component setups. Two wheel sizes (700&nbsp;or&nbsp;27.5″) and a few col­or options (Bone White/​Teal, Coal or Fire­ball). Built from a carbon fiber monocoque frame that weighs only 2.2 lbs / 1.0 kg.

<p>Kona have released their two Libre models for 2021, the CR and CR/DL. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/salsa-cutthroat-vs-kona-libre/">Want to see how the Libre stacks up against the Cutthroat?</a> The Libre is&nbsp;“a drop bar bike for big gravel, big climbs, and big adventures”. It essentially fits into the ‘gravel adventure bike’ category. With upright stack/reach ratio of 1.58 (54cm frame), Libre CR is fairly capable at climbing (with a 23.35″ climbing gear) and the 700c x 45mm WTB Riddlers allows for just enough clearance for mud. You might be able to fit a few mm wider tires but not much more than 45mm. </p>

<p>One of the most popular gravel bikes. The Revolt is offered in a slightly more budget friendly options starting from around $2,800 for a full carbon gravel bike.

The composite fork helps eat up bumps, and the D-Fuse seatpost and Contact XR D-Fuse handlebar absorb shocks and vibrations. </p>

<p>Available in about 8 different carbon specced models, included women&#8217;s bikes. The Canyon Grail is another contender with the Revolt, priced similarly. Weighing around 8.9 kg or 19.6 lbs, that means a 1040 gram frame. It features some unique design compared to other bikes on the market. Including the double decker bars, providing unique ergonomics and comfort. With a claimed; &#8220;up to 7x more vertical absorption than a traditional road cockpit*&#8221;. The main hype around this bike apart from design is vibration dampening. thanks to the flexible carbon seat post, carbon cockpit and high volume tires, all work together to eliminate road chatter and smooth our bumps. With a longer wheelbase and shorter stem they have produced a well balanced gravel bike for comfort, control, and speed. </p>

<p>Available in 4 different specced options, the Lauf Anywhere starts from around $2,390. But I personally love the $6,000+ Ultimate rig! The Anywhere is the ultimate mixed terrain bike from Lauf. Allowing you to ride pavement with some gravel to strapping on bags and gear to go on a wild adventure! The Lauf Smoothie handlebar was developed for this bike to help dampen road chatter. The bike has a &#8216;Just A Fork (JAF)&#8217;. That is normally light at 395g with triple cage-mounts each side.&nbsp;It has room for up to a 45mm 700c tire. Also take a closer look near the front derailleur location, it&#8217;s a beer opener, just incase you forgot yours on a rad adventure! </p>

<p>Very similar bike to the Anywhere, the True Grit is considered by Lauf as their gravel &amp; endurance bike. Made to tackle, gravel, sweep the singletracks, float on asphalt. The main difference is in the fork! With the Lauf Grit SL gravel suspension fork, which is tuned to fit each and every frame size. Most other aspects are rather similar, and yes you get the handy little bottle opener.</p>

<p>Kind of reminds me a little like the Cannondale Topstone finish, this rig won an award for being the best affordable bike of the year. Priced at just over $2,500 it is one of the most affordable carbon gravel bikes on the market. Weighing 20.3 lbs / 9.2 kg, which is a painted frame weight of 990g including all frame hardware. It features top tube mounts and a plethora of bottle mounts. Built to excel on UK bridle ways, fire roads and towpaths, while also capable on tarmac. Clearance for up to 42 mm tires and designed in a way to take on road chatter and minimise vibrations. Thanks to the bow-curve seat stays and seat tube cut out. </p>

And a max tire clearance for up to 650b × 2.1″ or 700c x 45mm&nbsp;tires.</p>



<h3>2021 Fuji Jari Carbon</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="448" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fuji-jari-carbon-13-2021-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C448&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7403" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fuji-jari-carbon-13-2021-1.jpeg?w=1349&amp;ssl=1 1349w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fuji-jari-carbon-13-2021-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fuji-jari-carbon-13-2021-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C638&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fuji-jari-carbon-13-2021-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C478&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fuji-jari-carbon-13-2021-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Ideal for racing, gravel riding and bikepacking. The Fuji Jari&#8217;s C15 frame comes in at under 1000 grams. Which they claim to be &#8220;the world&#8217;s first one-piece construction gravel bike frame&#8221;. The small attention to detail makes this bike stand out, with the armor shield under the downtube which guards against road debris and a Mylar wrap on the headtube stopping abrasions from handlebar bags. The stock 700x43c tires are rather skinny for my liking, but you can fit up to 700 x 47c or 27.5 x 2.2” tires. It even comes with it&#8217;s custom made, heavy duty bento box or top tube bag. The rear stay micro suspension also gives the bike 15mm of vertical flex to help dampen that road chatter. </p>

<p>The BMC URS comes in three different models starting from $2.999, the URS ONE weighing in at 20.1 lbs / 9.1 kg.

Featuring the Gravel+ geometry, the URS is optimised for a modern, aggressive gravel riding style. With a slack 70˚ head angle to create a long front-end and wheelbase for incredible stability. You get all the extra add-ons, top tube mount, integrated frame protectors, and micro travel technology. And tire clearance for 45 mm tires. </p>

<p>This has to be one of the most sold gravel bikes on the market. Every gravel grinder and their dog seem to have one. So that means they are a great carbon gravel bike option than, right? The main feature of the Checkpoint is the lightweight OCLV Carbon frame with IsoSpeed, a decoupler at the top tube/seat tube junction that provides additional compliance over rough terrain so you can stay stronger for longer. A carbon gravel bike made for epic all-road adventures. </p>

<p>Lats but certainly not least is the Salsa Warroad! With the top line model weighing 17.7 lbs / 8.0 kg. I was amazed by this bike when it was realised back in 2020, simply by its colours and design. It is essentially an endurance all-road bike. That is suited for 80% road and 20% whatever else! Compatible with 700c or 650b, the endurance road geometry positions you for long-haul comfort, and extra frame and fork mounts help keep you supplied for all-day ride. </p>
