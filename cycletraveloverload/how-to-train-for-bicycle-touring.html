<p><strong>Is it important to train before you go on a big bicycle tour?</strong></p>



<p>So this is a question that I’ve been asked couple of times and in this article I wanted to focus on the points in regards to training before you go out on a long tour.</p>



<p>In short, you<strong> probably need to do some kind of training</strong> but there is no right or wrong way to going about that.</p>



<p>You are probably going to run into some trouble with general strains and potential injuries if you are a majority of the time sedentary before the tour and then you go into high activity.</p>



<p>It is a good idea to get some kind of saddle time under your belt if you’ve never cycled before, or have done very minimal cycling.</p>



<p>If you don’t spend much time at all being active it may be a good idea beforehand to build up your fitness by maybe doing some hiking and some gym work. And just feel for when your lungs are up to it and your leg strength is there. </p>



<p>It’s probably best to build up to bigger distances. If you want to hit some kind of consistent average distance per day without having any kind of issues. You also want to get a little bit of practice with a heavy bike in a variety of different environments for long distance. </p>



<p>Say for example; the first couple of weeks of your tour you may want to start with much smaller distances covering 30 to 50 km just building up to a potential and consistent 100 km + days. In my opinion I think it’s a good idea to start off small and then increase the distance as time progresses on the tour. Instead of starting off pushing out huge k’s when your body isn’t used to it. This will allow your body to adapt to the daily mileage. </p>



<p>I would say that if you have decent cardiovascular fitness, you probably won’t have any problems. But it does depend if you’re going on a short tour, you may need to do some training but if you gonna be doing a longer tour. Probably best just to jump on the bike and you’ll just end up building fitness as you go along. </p>



<p>Injury wise on bicycle tours, from my experience. Most commonly are saddle sores these are kinda given. They can be prevented if you use padded cycling under shorts and chamois cream. But the only other injury I had was some stiffness in my Achilles tendon which was probably caused from a inconsistent set up of my bike and my leg was stretching to fair down to pedal. </p>



<p>You may want to consider stretching and give general care for your muscles during, after and before any physical activity. As cycling is a very isolated activity and you’re working the same muscles every day, sometimes they need a rest. I will even dedicate one or two days to rest all day once every month of so, on long tours. </p>



<p>As I come from a running background I do find that it does help with the cycling side of things in aspects for endurance, cardiovascular fitness, mental toughness and blocking out any discomfort. But once again it doesn’t consider much needed and important<strong> saddle time</strong>.</p>



<p>In terms of getting accustomed to riding a loaded touring bike and getting used to your specific bike setup. I think it is best to dedicate a week or so to using your geared up bike for commuting to work or to the shops. Just to get a bit of training under your belt so you know what to expect. Even try living like you are on tour. Using the items you are taking on tour while you are at home. Figure out where everything will go, etc.. </p>



<p>From firsthand experience your body is going to take a couple of days to get used to sleeping on the hard ground. I’ve done it tough and slept on yoga mats for entire tours which is not ideal. But those first few days are horrendous and if you don’t get enough sleep and enough rest it can lead onto the next day. Making it harder for your body to adapt to the new conditions. But like I’ve said throughout this post, it&#8217;s just about getting on the bike and with time you will adapt.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, you should focus on covering however many kilometres you feel like. Problems can occur when you push yourself to do a certain amount of miles that you have previously set for yourself to do. When you don’t reach those goals you can lose joy from the tour very fast, in return you can gain injuries. The point of a tour is to; go at a pace were you get to see the sights, meet cool people and have life changing experiences. </p>
