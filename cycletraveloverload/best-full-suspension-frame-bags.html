<p>In todays blog article we are going to dive into some of the best full suspension frame bag options out on the market today. There are some brands which make bags to custom fit your full suspension bike specially. </p>



<p>Full Suspension bikes are not your usual bikepacking bike but don&#8217;t let that stop you. Yes they may have very unique frame spaces but It is not impossible to get a frame bag that fits nicely. </p>



<p>When looking for a frame bag for a full suspension bike, do be aware that some brands make generic full suspension bags. However, due to the large variety of different shapes and sizes Full Suspension bikes come in it is difficult to have a standardised bag that is likely to fit all FS bikes. You may get lucky and get one of the bags that is listed down below to fit your bike well. But if this is not the case there are a huge variety of different bike bag brands that make custom Full Suspension bags. </p>

<h4>The process of getting a full suspension frame bag made</h4>



<p>If you have decided that you would like to go ahead and get a bag made to fit your full suspension setup it is a rather simple process from what I hear. Most bike bag brands will have you trace your bikes frame shape on some cardboard and have you mail it to them. When doing this make sure to show clearly where the Shock Body is located and any bottle cage mounts on the outside of the frame. This will make it easy for them to design the bag with straps in the appropriate locations. I also know that some brands go by the photo fit method. Which is where you take a photo of your bikes frame with a measuring tape in certain locations around your bike and just like you should receive a bike bag that fits perfectly. </p>



<p>Below are some of the readily available full suspension frame bag options that you can choose from.</p>



<h2>Rockgeist Full Suspension Framebag</h2>

<p>The revelate Designs Full Suspension frame bag is designed to fit bikes that have a horizontal shock placement along the top tube. As this is a very uncommon place to fit a frame bag. Revelate have come up with this bag that fixes this problem. And it is available to by straight off the shelve on REI.com </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="367" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/02479a8a-bc7f-478c-8eea-124d8dedb36b.jpeg?resize=720%2C367&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4563" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/02479a8a-bc7f-478c-8eea-124d8dedb36b.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/02479a8a-bc7f-478c-8eea-124d8dedb36b.jpeg?resize=300%2C153&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/02479a8a-bc7f-478c-8eea-124d8dedb36b.jpeg?resize=768%2C392&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/02479a8a-bc7f-478c-8eea-124d8dedb36b.jpeg?resize=50%2C26&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Please keep in mind that this is not a custom bike bag and is rather risky by for such a complex fit. But if you get it right and now that it will fit rather good on your bike you will be fine. The bag is built with exit ports to allow you to add a hydration pack if desired. Daisy-chain down-tube attachments allow for many different strap configurations that will suit your bike. It is padded with close-cell padding technology to protect. Foam spacers on the down tube also help with abrasions and damage to frame on contact. If you are after some further assistance in determining the correct size needed for your bike, check out the sizing chart <a href="https://www.rei.com/media/9c5ba8ef-246a-4d58-bb8c-3d77bae93fc1">here</a>.

<p>This bag is very specific, made only for the Mojo HD4/HD3/M3 frames. And can be mounted without the need for unsightly straps.

Made by Blackburn and priced on <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FIbis-Mojo-3HD3HD4-Pork-Chop-Frame-Bag">Jenson USA for $49.99</a>. Some say that it &#8220;fits good and doesn&#8217;t move around when riding&#8221;. </p>

<p>A less full suspension frame bag approach to a bike bag, this bag is best suited for using when you just want to attach a bag that does not have to fit perfectly in the frame of your FS bike. Made by Blackburn the Corner Bag is exactly that. Honestly I am not too sure if it is the same or similar bag to the one mentioned previously. But if so this one comes with straps making it fit all other bikes that have the frame space to accomodate it. It is a handy rigid pouch that has been designed to fit right behind the headtube. It’s roomy enough to store most of your riding essentials so you won’t have a need for a saddle bag anymore. Priced at <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FBlackburn-Outpost-Corner-Bag">$34.99 on Jenson USA</a></p>
