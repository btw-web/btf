<p>Gravel bikes are cool. But then if you mix that with a electric then look out! If you ask people about their opinion on eBikes you will get a mixed bag. Some people really hate them. True they are not for everyone. But they are a wonderful gift from the universe. I was so excited to do the research for this article and go through all the best electric gravel bikes that are available at the moment. And if you are a bike geek like me, then you are going to love these bikes! Electric bikes like these are great for enabling cyclists to reach new highs and tackle bigger rides. </p>



<p>These bikes are in no particular order of preference. Yes some are rather expensive at over $9,000 but I tried my best to offer price ranges and value in the bikes. Finding cheaper bike options for $3,499. A very niche subject in a niche bike type. Here are some of the best gravel eBikes. </p>

<p>On first impressions it is hard to tell that this is a electric bike. Reason being that the most obvious thing on a electric bike is the battery. but on this bike it is tucked away inside the frame. The bike is not designed to take over your work load like many electric bikes. Don&#8217;t expect full power take over, expect &#8216;Enough Power&#8217; to transform your ride smoothly and subtly. Orbea Gain M21 is offered in the 1 x 11 speed Sram Force setup on this &#8216;All Road&#8217; model. Priced at £3,999.00</p>
