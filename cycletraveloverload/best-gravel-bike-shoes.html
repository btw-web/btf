<p>With some newly released gravel bikes shoes over recent times. I am super exciting to get this show on the road. So what are the some of the best shoes for gravel grinding?</p>



<p>For this write up I want to try my best to keep this only gravel shoe oriented. Some advise given out their when talking about the &#8216;best&#8217; gravel shoes, other shoes are mentioned like MTB and road cycling shoes. Yes they may work well for gravel riding, but I want this to be specifically about gravel purpose built shoes only, if I can. </p>

<h3>Are gravel shoes even necessary? </h3>



<p>Gravel riding in general has gotten very popular over the last year or so and bike brands and companies have been making gravel bikes, then even gravel e-bikes. Along with this comes all the other number of gear you can name with a the word gravel in front of it. In my own opinion if you already have a nice pair of bikepacking clip-in shoes, potential recommended from the linked article above then honestly there is no need to go out and also buy a pair of gravel specific shoes. As the general consensus is that they are going to do the job just fine. </p>



<p>However if you are like me and like to roll with a more comfortable flat sole shoe for extended bikepacking adventures then a gravel shoes might be on your radar. It also depends on your purpose. Are you looking to get them for gravel commuting? or gravel racing? If you are racing you might want a seperate pair and cut as much weigh as possible combined that with exceptional performance for winning races. If I was into gravel racing, which I&#8217;m not (at the moment) then a seperate and dedicated pair of gravel shoes would make sense. </p>



<p>It is also said that there is some cross over when it comes to gravel bike related products at mountain biking. As most MTB gear is generally well suited for gravel uses. You could get MTB shoes for gravel biking, if you have MTB shoes you might already be good to go! </p>



<p>Gravel bike shoes tend to be more minimalist compared to bulky MTB shoes options. You can expect gravel shoes tend to have reduced amount of sole, heel and toe protection. All for a general lightweight advantage. </p>

The bottom is made from a Nylon composite Bronze Series sole which provides stiff-yet-walkable performance and has a stiffness index of 6 of 14.

<p>The Quoc GT gravel specific shoes are one of the popular options with all terrain riding. As Quoc themselves say, when heading out to the backcountry to hanging with the bunch, we needed a pair of gravel bike shoes that could handle trails, tarmac and off-bike exploring in the space of a single day. But they didn&#8217;t exist. So we made the Gran Tourer &#8211; the ultimate bike shoe for mixed-terrain riding.</p>

<p>Just to make things clear this is not the Mazda RX8 we are talking about. But they look just as good! With its camo design, this mountain bike shoe is another good option for gravel cycling. But for a bit more dollars! This shoe combines the best characteristics of Shimano&#8217;s high-end road and mountain footwear into one shoe that&#8217;s specifically designed for gravel racing. These shoes are said to be one of the best for gravel bike enthusiasts. As they are lightweight and stiff, but with grippy outsoles and just enough toe flex to be comfortable to walk in. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=92594cfb-2b30-40ba-ab76-f9c20ed4612c&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fshimano-rx8-mountain-bike-shoe-mens">Priced at $250</a></p>



<p>If you are also into mountain biking you might not, no longer need other shoes as these could be perfect for both MTB and gravel rides! With this shoe however some have said that it is slightly less comfortable to walk in than most MB shoes. </p>

<p>Another Shimano shoe option that we have to share with you is the XC5. These made it in the best bikepacking shoes article. As they are a great gravel riding shoe, that look so stylish and are super comfortable. The sole is stiff enough. Some riders mentioned a concern with the laces coming undone and problems with being able to tighten the shoe as you are riding as there is no Boa tightener. However the shoe does have a Mini Power Strap to hold the laces in place. Features a lightweight and rigid carbon fiber reinforced midsole. A supple synthetic leather with perforated venting for superior fit. Exclusive Michelin high-traction, mud-shedding tread and Rubber anti-slip arch outsole pattern. <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/34Z6kyn">Price from $108.68</a></strong></p>

<p>These shoes are the perfect balance of durability, comfort, and adventure. The shoe you look to when the paved road ends and you say yes to gravel trails. I am not going to talk too much about these shoes as availability is limited. But the shoes feature a Body Geometry sole and footbed which are ergonomically designed and scientifically tested to boost power, increase efficiency, and reduce chance of injury by optimizing hip, knee, and foot alignment. <a href="https://www.specialized.com/au/en/recon-mixed-terrain-shoes/p/117577">Priced at $100</a></p>
