<p>Are you looking for some fat bike fender or mudguard options? Maybe you have a fat bike that you take out bikepacking and you went on some real muddy stuff and those fatties got mud everywhere? And you are looking for a solution? Or maybe you are in the market for a fat bike and just seeing if fat bike mudguards and fenders are even a thing. And if there is any available specifically for bikepacking adventures? Well I happy to say that these few fenders listed below are great for most fat bikepacking rigs. </p>



<p>Fat bikes are unique and require mostly specialised fitted gear, such as fenders. I asked a few fat bikepackers what fender and mudguards it is that they use for their fat bikes. So lets get into some of your options. </p>
