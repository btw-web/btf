<h3>1. Time Atac XC 8</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSC00347.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6892" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSC00347.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSC00347.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSC00347.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSC00347.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSC00347.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Time Atac XC 8 pedals are by far my personal favourite. Yes they are one of the most expensive, but super lightweight and perform flawlessly. Technically MTB pedals but they still allow you to crush gravel. Read my <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/time-atac-xc-8-review-carbon-mountain-bike-pedals/">review here</a>.</p>



<p>These Time pedals feature a&nbsp;hollow CrMo axle, super light carbon body, 3 position spring tension adjustment. With Auto Tension Adjustment Concept for easy engagement and dependable release. With a self-cleaning double sided step in with wide entry area. Including ATAC cleats offer 6mm lateral float, 13 or 17 degree release angle. </p>



<p>These pedals are solid and perform very well. They have been developing these style of pedals for over 20+ years and it seems as though they just keep refining and improving them.</p>

<p>They are&nbsp;light, strong and stiff. If you are buying Time branded pedals for the first time. It&#8217;s important to note that when you first get them and spin them, there will be a little resistance. This is good, as it means the seals are in place and working. You will not notice this resistance when ridden.</p>

<p>These carbon pedals just keep on going, with no problems. They have been tested while being hit hard on a rock, while riding technical stuff and they continue to shine. There is a <a href="https://amzn.to/31UTkrK">XC 12</a> option available but the XC 8 have better reviews and are much more bang for the buck at more then 50% cheaper, at $119.95 and can be purchased <a href="https://amzn.to/35aTVYw">here</a>. </p>



<h3>2. Race Face Chester</h3>

<p>If flat pedals are more your style and you want that perfect balance between price and performance, these Race Face Chesters have you covered. Read my <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/race-face-chester-review-buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-flat-pedals/">review here</a>.</p>



<p>The Chester pedal is made from nylon composite body with 8 hex traction pins. That provide the same superior grip you&#8217;d find on alloy pedals. The cro-mo axle is fully sealed and a 100% serviceable bearing and bushing system. </p>



<p>This pedal offers great performance for a wide range of riders, especially those looking to adventure the gravel. While not being expensive, they are a value for money option at $49.95. They have got 290 reviews, with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating. That is saying something!</p>



<p>Here are some of the benefits to these flat gravel pedals. </p>

<ul><li>Nylon composite body keeps the overall weight low</li><li>Replaceable steel pins (8 per side) offer the same superior grip as alloy pedals</li><li>Fully sealed keeps trail grim out of the moving parts</li><li>Easily serviceable</li><li>Smooth and durable sealed bearing and bushing system</li><li>Cro-mo axle is tough as nails</li><li>Thin and lightweight concave platform offers a more natural footing</li><li>Large platform with same grip as traditional alloy pedals</li></ul>



<p>Some owners of this pedals have mentioned that the &#8220;grip is phenomenal! Once your foot is on it&#8217;s not moving. Highly, highly recommended!&#8221; It seems they are that grippy that sometimes you can have trouble just adjusting your foots placing. If you are after a affordable and strong pedal then look no further. </p>



<h3>3. Shimano PD-M520</h3>

<p>If you are after a budget clipless pedal option, and alternative to the Time Atac pedals, these are a good option. Yes they are heavier and not as light. They still make a good pedal for that beginner gravel grinder. </p>



<p>These are one of the best value for money clipless gravel pedals on the market. The PD-M520 features adjustable in/out release tension and includes a set of SH51 SPD cleats with 4 degrees of float. While they only weigh slightly more than the higher-end XT and XTR pedals from Shimano, they boast all of the same features and the same high-grade performance at a fraction of the price. </p>

<h2>What to look for when selecting gravel pedals?</h2>



<p>First we need to quickly cover the selection process when looking for the best gravel bike pedals.</p>



<p>Okay so you have discovered that you love shredding the gravel on your bike adventures more so then just traditional touring on busy roads with traffic. You are searching for those quiet wilderness environments to explore. </p>



<p>When looking for pedals that are preferred for this style of exploration you will need to look for pedals that are suited best to MTB shoes. With such off-road bike adventures you are going to be walking around. And you need shoes that are both comfortable on bike and off. Making them best for hike a bike sections. </p>



<p>There are three kinds of pedals options that are best for gravel bikes. Flat pedals, clipless MTB pedals and double sided clipless and flat pedals. So why no road clipless pedals you ask? Well maybe you didn&#8217;t! But anyway, it is recommended not to use them as they are suited for road shoes. Which are very uncomfortable when walking around on rough surfaces, not providing any grip and are not good options for using a multiple purpose shoes, for at camp, etc. </p>



<p>If you prefer flat pedals like me, then there is one major factor for the best flat pedals for gravel biking. That being that they should have large pins around the pedals, helping your shoes grip to the pedal. Also when riding up steep hills this will help produce better efficiency and stop your feet from slipping. </p>

<p>When looking at pedal another component to consider is the build quality, this is often harder to know for sure, without spending many hours testing the durability. </p>



<p>So when looking at pedals you want to have in mind. Can I use bikepacking shoes or MTB shoes with them? Well there is no need to look any further. </p>



<p>Here is a list of some more flat and clipless gravel pedals for your next gravel bike adventures. </p>

<p>Somethings to consider about these pedals is that they don&#8217;t come with the studs installed when you purchase them.

And will not fit without them, so it is another thing to try and not loose. &nbsp;</p>

But before you do, it is worth mentioning that these pedals do have a &#8220;break-in&#8221; period for the spring tension and ability to clip in and out. Out of the box they are very stiff, to the point of not being able to clip in, and once in, not being able to get out. It is recommended to ride around a familiar location while repeatedly clipping in and out to smooth out the spring action. After a few weeks they are easy to get into and are becoming easier to get out of as well.</p>
