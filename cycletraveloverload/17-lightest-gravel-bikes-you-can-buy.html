<p>Self proclaimed as the world&#8217;s lightest gravel bike. The Specialized S-Works Crux is said to weigh <strong>6.9kg (16.21 lb</strong>), which is their top of the line option. While the Crux Comp weighs in at 8.5 kg (18.73 lb), which is their base line model in the 2022 lineup. </p>



<p>Offering some of the best tire clearance to weight ratios on the market with the option to run up to 47c tires while also offering a performance gravel geometry. With a 1.46 stack/reach ratio for a 56cm frame. The performance focused geometry “creates the feeling of being ‘in’ the bike for incredible confidence while still feeling quick and nimble at the bars.&#8221;</p>



<p>To get lightweight gravel bike status the Crux had to drop the rack, fender and bag mounts allowing riders to engage in a straightforward riding experience. Making it not the most ideal bike for bikepacking in this regard, you can still mount bags though. Also the bike provides a 10mm longer reach to give riders a more ideal weight distribution and the shorter stem offers more controlled steering. </p>

<p>The Lauf Anywhere lightest bike build comes in at <strong>7.7 kg (17.0 lbs)</strong> for a medium sized frame.

<p>Offering all the standard performance gravel bike features. Such as dual wheel size compatibility and a dropped chainstay. These bikes find that balance between road bike speed plus go-anywhere capabilities. Making them fast but also able to go on rad adventures. The idea behind the U.P.P.E.R bikes is the option to run multiple tire setups.</p>



<p>Road tires to make it a very fast road bike, turn it into a go-anywhere bike with gravel tires 32-40mm or run 650b mountain bike tires allowing it to be pretty much unstoppable. It does feature a road riding position for that extra speed even if you run MTB tires. Meaning you can get to the trails faster. Weighing just <strong>under 8 kg</strong>!</p>

<p>The Salsa Warroad top line model weighs <strong>8.0 kg (17.7 lb)</strong>. I was amazed by this bike when it was realised back in 2020, simply by its colours and design. It is essentially an endurance all-road bike. That is suited for 80% road and 20% whatever else! Compatible with 700c or 650b, the endurance road geometry positions you for long-haul comfort, and extra frame and fork mounts help keep you supplied for all-day ride.</p>

Also rumour has it that you can fit up to 53mm 700c tires. </p>
