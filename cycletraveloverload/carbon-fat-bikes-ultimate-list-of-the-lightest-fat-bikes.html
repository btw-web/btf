<p>So you want a fat bike? but not only that it has to be lighter than a touring bike or comparable to a standard gravel bike? So you can throw it around trail bends and shred! </p>



<p>Most of the downsides that come with fat bikes is with &#8220;how harder&#8221; they are to ride. As the misconception is that they are &#8220;super heavy&#8221;. But you can get around that completely with a fully carbon build fat bike. </p>



<h4>How much do fat bikes weigh?</h4>



<p>Normal base model fat bikes come in at around 33 to 36 pounds or roughly 15 to 16 kg. More premium models or in our case today, carbon fat bikes, are going to weigh in at 30 pounds or under. That is roughly 14 Kg and under. But 14 Kg is still rather on the heavy side with what is completely possible. I have seen builds get down to as low as 9 Kg for a complete carbon fat bike! And yes it is still strong enough to go on some gnarly fat biking adventures. Honestly I would be happy enough with a fat bike under 13 Kg as this is the same weight for <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/kona-sutra-ltd-review-bikepacking-bike/">my adventure/gravel bike</a>. In my opinion if you can get a fat bike under this then you are winning! </p>



<p>The bikes with will go through today will include there weight and all will be under this 14 kg so they are decently light enough for some efficient and fun packed fat biking adventures! </p>

<p>I was unable to weight the weight for this bike bike from what I can tell it would be around that 13 Kg mark! The Ithaqua 1 is a lightweight carbon fat bike built for performance and adventure. Room for up to  26&#8243; x 5.0&#8243; or 27.5&#8243; x 4.0&#8243; tires. It is the ultimate ride for all-season cyclists looking for the full fat experience without the weight. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=3727a95c-b736-4887-82ff-a1d0ed6654a8&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.norco.com%2Fbikes%2F2020%2Fmountain%2Ffat-bike%2Fithaqua-carbon%2Fithaqua-1%2F%3Favad%3D256925_f1bd22555">Price $4,299.00</a></p>

<p>The Fatboy as the name suggests features fat 27.5&#215;3.8” tires. The light yet tough frame holds up well for whatever adventures you have planned for it. I was unable to find 2020 numbers but 2019&#8217;s model weighs in at<strong> 25 lbs 15 oz</strong>. I feel like a ring announcer before a boxing match! That is about <strong>11.76 kg</strong> with a SRAM GX Eagle 1X drivetrain. However there is a small problem with this bike as stated from reviews, mentioning that the cables inside the carbon frame rattle around, &#8220;like a bucket of marbles, super annoying.&#8221; <a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/fatboy-comp-carbon/p/171063">Price $2,950</a></p>

<p>Another Salsa carbon fat bike option, it is a little heavier then the Beargrease at <strong>29.9 lbs / 13.6 kg</strong>. The idea with the Mukluk&#8217;s geometry is with the use of the shortest chainstays possible with a head tube angle and fork offset that place your center of gravity farther back over the rear wheel. This geometry results in a fat bike that rides like a trail bike. Rolling on 26 x 4.8 in tires and <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F161754%2Fsalsa-mukluk-carbon-nx-eagle-fat-bike%3Fcm_mmc%3Daff_AL-_-203885-_-256925-_-NA%26avad%3D256925_e1bd2854d%26CA_6C15C%3D120217890007603498">priced at $3,149.00</a></p>

<p>Light, fast, and nimble? These are not typically the words used to describe a fat bike. But you know we saved the lightest fat bike till last. The Lamere Cycles Fat Bike is the lightest in the world. Claimed as the &#8220;most affordable carbon fat racing bikes built&#8221;. Here some of the build options available.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sram XX1 with LaMere Carbon Wheelset:&nbsp;<strong>$5500&nbsp; 21.8lbs</strong></p>



<p>  Sram XO1 with LaMere Carbon Wheelset: <strong>$5200  22.5lbs</strong></p>



<p>  Sram GX 11spd with LaMere Carbon Wheelset: <strong>$4600  23.25lbs</strong></p>



<p>  Shimano XTR 11spd with LaMere Carbon Wheelset: <strong>$5400  22lbs</strong></p>



<p>  Shimano XT 11spd with LaMere Carbon Wheelset: <strong>$4950  22.5lbs</strong></p>



<p>* All the above weights are with wimpy HuskerDu tires, so add a pound to each build weight with real  winter tread. Add HED Big Deal or BFD wheels with new carbon Brickhouse hubs to any build for an additional $500.</p>



<p>The frame definitely has a more race geometry to it, with 70.5 degree head tube angle and 467mm chainstays for stability and awesome hill climbing traction. Check out this <a href="http://blog.fairwheelbikes.com/2015/01/27/worlds-lightest-fat-bike-18-7-pounds/">18.7 pound or 8.48 kg build</a> with a Lamere frameset.
