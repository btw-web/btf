<p>Comfort on a bike tour if one of the more important things to take into consideration. And the main body contact points need to have stability when contacting the bike. Accommodating and helping to keep you comfortable through the many miles you will be travelling. The main two areas for bike touring is your <a href="http://cycletraveloverload.com/best-touring-saddles-best-road-bike-saddle-for-long-rides/">saddle</a> and handlebars. In this article we are going to pick apart what to look for in a set of handlebars for touring. And what are your best bike touring handlebars to choose from. Hopefully you will come to a conclusion with enough knowledge to go out a buy yourself some amazing handlebars. </p>

<p>It seems like it is becoming a habit for me to change my handlebars every time I go on a new bike touring adventure. After trying many different types I have some favourites, but I am always up to try some new bars. </p>



<p>My main two favourites are the butterfly bar or trekking bar, and maybe some flared dropbars. </p>

<p>It is a personal preference at the end of the day, so I encourage you to give many different handlebars a go. Because you just never know which ones will work best for you. </p>

<p>For this article I asked many bike tourers and bikepackers what handlebars they personally use and would recommend to a friend. I compiled all my results and will share them with you later on. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1688" height="950" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_3798.jpg?fit=720%2C405" alt="" class="wp-image-2479" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_3798.jpg?w=1688&amp;ssl=1 1688w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_3798.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_3798.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_3798.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_3798.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_3798.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption><a href="https://amzn.to/2ooy0fw">Funn G Wide Gravel Handlebars</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>But first lets have a look at all the main aspects to consider before you go out and buy yourself some handlebars for your touring bike. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Wrist comfort</strong> is a major one. This goes for any kind of comfort on the bike. You are going to be spending countless days, months or even years riding your bike when touring. The handlebars need to relieve any pressure on your joints. This is what makes the best touring handlebars great is they give you the ability to switch around your hand position. </p>



<p>Butterfly handlebars are my favourite for <strong>multiple hand positions</strong>. You move your hands about in 5 or more different positions, stretching out your arms, and moving them around to prevent them from getting sore, being in the same position for too long. If you have other generic handlebars like a flat bar your hand has this constant pressure in one spot and can cause nerve pain or even damage. </p>



<p>Your handlebar choice can effect your <strong>overall bike fit and posture</strong>. I have toured with some all-road handlebars before and I found myself leaning too far forward in a more aero, race position. After about 20 days touring this really started to make my back hurt. However, I just recently got some flared dropbars that have hoods that stand higher, and they all ready feel as though they have improved my posture. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/b8f817757e691986f8ece41492bd06b6-1.jpg?resize=469%2C567" alt="" class="wp-image-2498" width="469" height="567" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/b8f817757e691986f8ece41492bd06b6-1.jpg?w=540&amp;ssl=1 540w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/b8f817757e691986f8ece41492bd06b6-1.jpg?resize=248%2C300&amp;ssl=1 248w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/b8f817757e691986f8ece41492bd06b6-1.jpg?resize=41%2C50&amp;ssl=1 41w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/458382068322522553/">https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/458382068322522553/</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Depending on the style of handlebar, will dictate the type of <strong>mounting space</strong> you will have for gadgets. I found the butterfly bars and 500 mm flared drop bars and many others in this list provide ample amounts of space to mount a, cycle computer, phone, bell and many other accessories to your handlebar. Resulting in a cockpit that looks like that of a spaceship. </p>



<p><strong>Handlebar bag compatibility</strong> is something else to consider when choosing handlebars. Make sure to find the length of the bar or check the dimensions of your handlebar bag to see if they will work in unison. Some bikepacking handlebar packs are made for dropbars and could be to long for narrow dropbars. Also If you are looking to get a Rando bag for example you will need to double check. </p>



<p><strong>Different handlebar sizes, and stem clamp compatibility. </strong>Different bars come in varying stem clamp sizes. 25.4 mm is standard which os for most MTB handlebars, the butterfly bars I got where this size. And then 31.8 mm which is (OS or oversize) in diameter. However, this size is becoming more and more popular due to the properties of strength and stiffness, the diameter provides. </p>



<h2>All Road / Drop Handlebars </h2>

<p>Referring to the standard dropbar handlebars you have on road bikes. They are more for the experienced rider. I personally don&#8217;t recommend them for touring compared to the flared dropbar option. They can be too narrow making them harder for beginners to manage. </p>



<h4><strong>Pros to standard road dropbars</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Narrow for riding through traffic</li><li>Quicker and more responsive cornering, helps manoeuvring quickly around a hazard. </li><li>Provide multiple hand positions, drops, hoods, back and front</li><li>Allowing some straight back posture on the flats</li><li>Able to get down in the aero position, to battle head winds and be more efficient </li></ul>



<h4><strong>Cons to standard road dropbars</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Don&#8217;t provide as much comfort on rough terrain</li><li>Not the very long bars, making it harder to fit bikepacking handlebar packs/rolls with enough space for hands. </li><li>More difficult for less experienced riders</li><li>Result in bad posture for extended trips, causing a sore back</li><li>Harder to access break levers</li></ul>



<p>I am going to be honest and not recommend any specific handlebar options for these type of handlebars. As they are just not the best option out there for touring bars. There are so much better bars in this list. Although, having that said, if they are the only bars you have. Especially the ones that came with your traditional bar-end shifter touring bike. They work just fine, I am more referring to the handlebars that are from road bikes as these are very narrow. </p>

<p>However I know some bike travellers who rock some drop bars with aero bar combination. If you are looking for a more efficient ride in terms of aerodynamics, freeing up space on your handlebars giving you more options for mounting gear and gadgets. While also offering more hand positions and locations to move about, stretching the body. They also slightly lift your bum of the saddle. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bikepacking-aero-bars-why-use-them-handlebar-bags-with-aero-bars/">A mate rode around Australia on a fixie bike with a aero setup, read more here.</a></p>

<p>flat are common on some expedition touring bikes they are my second last preferred type of touring handlebars in this list. But don&#8217;t get me wrong they are still good, depending on your preferences. Some tourers recommend, MTB Riser Handlebars with Ergon Grips. </p>



<h4><strong>Pros to Flat / Riser Bars</strong></h4>



<ul><li>You are able to gain better control with flat bars compared to most</li><li>When riding out of the saddle they give you leverage</li><li>Ease of swapping grips</li><li>Many mounting options for accessories</li><li>A good choice for the beginner bike tourer</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Cons to Flat / Riser Bars</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Unless you use bar-ends like Ergon Grips, these bars only provide really one main hand position, which is mainly why I don&#8217;t recommend them as much as others. </li><li>Depending on the handlebars width they can be difficult to navigate through tight traffic. </li><li>On standard flat handlebars they are not ergonomic for your wrists</li></ul>

<p>Something like the about combination is a recommended way to use flat bars. As the Ergon Grips offer some extra hand positions. It is a popular choice with some bike tourers. in the photo above they are using the <a href="https://amzn.to/2nNbLQn">BioKork Grips</a>. </p>

<p>These are my personal favourite handlebars. There are so many varying options to choose from. And I am still experimenting with what I like best. </p>



<h4>Butterfly Bars or Trekking Handlebars</h4>



<p>Are the most common handlebar for expedition touring bikes. And are used most for multiple year tours around the world. I highly recommend these bars, from <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/trekking-bars-butterfly-handlebars-review-my-experience-after-5000-km/">my personal experience of over 7,500 KM while using them</a>. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/516wW0Wln6L._SL1024_.jpg?resize=359%2C128" alt="" class="wp-image-2434" width="359" height="128" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/516wW0Wln6L._SL1024_.jpg?w=995&amp;ssl=1 995w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/516wW0Wln6L._SL1024_.jpg?resize=300%2C108&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/516wW0Wln6L._SL1024_.jpg?resize=768%2C276&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/516wW0Wln6L._SL1024_.jpg?resize=50%2C18&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p style="text-align:center">MonkeyJack Trekking Butterfly&nbsp;<br>Price &#8211; $15.98 (Cheapest on Amazon)</p>



<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://amzn.to/2nKNeLK">Shop Now on Amazon</a></div>



<p>They provide a smorgasbord of hand positions. I go into detail with the review linked <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/trekking-bars-butterfly-handlebars-review-my-experience-after-5000-km/">here</a>. (also linked in the above paragraph). </p>



<p><strong>Why choose butterfly bars? </strong></p>



<ul><li>Upright position!</li><li>Better for posture</li><li>Comfort</li><li>Many Different hand positions and ability to spread your arms</li><li>Change your overall riding position frequently</li><li>Less expensive then other bars</li><li>Allows for a lot of control and leverage on rough surfaces with a very wide grip</li></ul>



<h3>Flared Dropbars</h3>



<p>These type of handlebars are my favourite at the moment. Recently getting some Funn G Wide 500 mm Bars fitted on my Surly Long Haul Trucker. Flared dropbars offer some great stability and extra cushioning when riding the rough stuff. </p>



<p>They have found popularity in the cycle-cross and gravel racing communities where control over off-road surfaces is important.&nbsp;But for touring they offer a range of hand positions, reducing fatigue. </p>



<p>All the extra bar length means heaps of potential for mounting whatever your heart desires. So much space allowing you to also fit handlebar bags with ease. Flared drops feel more natural than conventional drops. </p>



<p>Somethings to keep in mind with flare drops is to clamp them up fairly tight and also they make it harder to lean your bike against a wall. </p>



<h4>Funn G Wide Gravel Handlebars</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/71aN-SEE4XL._SL1500_-1.jpg?fit=720%2C399" alt="" class="wp-image-2431" width="352" height="194" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/71aN-SEE4XL._SL1500_-1.jpg?w=1360&amp;ssl=1 1360w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/71aN-SEE4XL._SL1500_-1.jpg?resize=768%2C426&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/71aN-SEE4XL._SL1500_-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C568&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/71aN-SEE4XL._SL1500_-1.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" /></figure></div>



<p style="text-align:center">Funn<br>G Wide<br>Price &#8211; $74.99</p>

<p>It makes sense to get these bars in the longer 500 mm, compared to the same priced 480 mm. Only cause you get more bar for your buck. But it is personal preference, I love how wise they are.</p>



<p>They are originally designed for hardcore gravel riding. Made with a heat treated, triple butted high grade 6069 alloy. With a 31.8 mm clamp diameter. With a 6° back sweep, 25° flare. The width of the bar offers very generous luggage spaces, making them perfect for long bike tours.</p>



<p>When I initially got these drops I was really surprised by how long the reach is and how deep the drops are. Very different from a short and shallow standard road drop bar. It may be a good idea to ride a shorter stem. </p>

<p>Another handlebar options that is trusted and recommended by other bike tourers and bikepackers. A little more expensive option compared to most touring handlebars. But they are made from a Aussie brand, with a cool ethos, that is worth supporting. </p>



<h4>Salsa Woodchippers</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/039d307a-7b41-4abb-b245-f4af4fb4f321.jpeg?resize=384%2C93" alt="" class="wp-image-2435" width="384" height="93" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/039d307a-7b41-4abb-b245-f4af4fb4f321.jpeg?resize=300%2C74&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/039d307a-7b41-4abb-b245-f4af4fb4f321.jpeg?resize=50%2C12&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/039d307a-7b41-4abb-b245-f4af4fb4f321.jpeg?zoom=2&amp;resize=384%2C93 768w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p style="text-align:center">Salsa<br>Woodchipper<br>Price &#8211; $50 USD</p>



<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F141433%2Fsalsa-woodchipper-318-handlebar">Shop Now at REI</a></div>



<p>The Woodchippers are made from a lightweight (375 grams) and strong 6061-T6 aluminum alloy construction. With a unique shape for comfort and control on rough terrain. Ergonomic design works well with integrated road shift/brake levers or bar end shifters. 114mm drop, with a 56mm reach, 25° flare angle, and 38° drop angle. Keep note that, the Salsa Woodchippers require a unique setup for optimal comfort. Brake/shifter position should be canted downward slightly, resulting in a 20-25° downward angle of the drops. </p>

<p style="text-align:center">Jones<br>H-Bar<br>Price &#8211; $79 USD</p>



<p>The Jones H Bar, again like most alternative bars offer, many hand positions. The&nbsp;bars allow your arms to flex more so in the direction they are meant to flex. Reducing the strain that can result in using standard flat bars. </p>



<p>Some tourers have complained about the difficulty in using these very wide (660 mm) bars on really rough terrain. It may lack the precise manoeuvring on single track and other technical riding conditions. </p>

<p>I have always wanted to get these bars for my Surly LHT. Since I just recently got a new handlebar, it may have to wait. But for certain this is the next set of handlebars on my list. Might even ask Santa for them. </p>



<p>They are just out there as the name suggests &#8216;crazy&#8217;. Jus looking at them you can see the potential for all the different types of hand positions you can use while touring. They are alf cruiser bar, half bull horns. The bar has a variety of different clamp diameters which can be a little confusing. The main bar is 22.2 mm so MTB grips, levers and shifters fit. Bull horns are 23.8 mm so road levers/bar end shifters fit. 25.4mm clamp area. </p>



<p>It is a rather unusual design but it works. The bars have two main hand positions. On the handgrips and on the horns. Both are both so comfortable, that some tourers who have used them reported, that they gained energy and less soreness on their rides. </p>



<p>These bars essentially give you the best of both worlds. A comfortable upright position and an aero position. </p>

<p>I really admire Alee, I was lucky to get the chance to interview him. If you don&#8217;t know who he is. He is the owner of Cycling About.com a website dedicated to helping people learn all that they need about bike touring and bikepacking. He partly inspired me to start this blog that you are reading right here.</p>

<p>Anyway it seems like a dream come true. To partner with a brand like Koga to develop some really cool bars. They are designed to combined all the attributes in the, Moloko, Jones Loop H-Bar and the Velo Crazy bar, all together in a one handlebar that does it all. If you want to read Alee&#8217;s write up on these awesome bars, <a href="https://www.cyclingabout.com/koga-denham-bars/">check it out here.</a> </p>



<h4><br>Bullhorn Bar</h4>

<p style="text-align:center">State Bicycle Co. (various brands)<br>Bullhorn Bar<br>Price &#8211; $26.99 (on Amazon)</p>

<p>While these bars are a cheaper option. It seems better value to get something like The <a href="https://amzn.to/2nB1Kpr">Koga Denham bars</a> as they pretty much have bull horn bars in the design, but also give you heaps of other hand positions. Or a <a href="https://amzn.to/2nKNeLK">Butterfly bar</a> that offers more hand positions too, but for a cheaper price.  </p>



<p>But depending on what you like, some bike tourers recommend the bull horn bar for a bike touring setup. </p>

<p>Mustache handlebars are another one of those bars recommended by some bike tourers. They offer a upright comfortable ride, reducing any wrist strain. Only thing is the lack of many different hand positions, this is a big thing for me and you need that for longer tours. </p>
