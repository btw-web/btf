<p>If you ask me there is no better way to reset and get that new perspective on life. Then getting on your touring bike and just riding for days and days on end. Camping in the most peaceful environments and riding through challenging mountains. Nothing more rewarding then getting weeks into a adventure and looking at where you started from, and having that sense of accomplishment knowing that you travelled all that distance on your own steam. There is something romantic about it. </p>



<p>Touring is not about how fast you can get to a destination. It is about the journey itself, taking in the moment, activating all your senses and being here right now. Carting all that you need to thrive for months or even years on end, this type of self-sufficient exploration demands a bike that provides comfort for the many hours in the saddle. </p>



<p>There is no need to buy many multiple bikes, the right touring bike can be a great commuter while also being that rig that transports you to all the corners of the world. Touring bikes come in about three or four different categories which are dependant upon your preferred type of exploration. </p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://mailchi.mp/e3df8925e281/freebook"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="95" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Sound-2-3.png?resize=720%2C95&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5717" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Sound-2-3.png?w=760&amp;ssl=1 760w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Sound-2-3.png?resize=300%2C39&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Sound-2-3.png?resize=50%2C7&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></figure></div>



<p>There are <strong>traditional or classic, adventure, expedition and light touring</strong> or gravel touring bikes.</p>



<p><strong>Traditional</strong> touring bikes are much <a href="http://cycletraveloverload.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-road-bike-and-a-touring-bike/">different compared to a road bike.</a> They are built to be tough and withstand the intensity of long daily distances compounded over many days. months or years. You could just <a href="http://cycletraveloverload.com/can-you-put-panniers-on-a-road-bike/">put panniers on your road bike</a> and be on your way. You should be okay for a couple weeks. But they are simply not built for the demands of bike touring. Touring bikes have stronger parts, made to withstand all the strains over time. They are typically made from steel, have upright geometry, longer chainstays, and often have fenders and a rear rack for panniers. The wheels of traditional touring bikes are usually 700c and have a high spoke count of (32 or 36-hole). Traditional or classic touring bikes used to have rim brakes, but mechanical disc brakes are starting to take over the category. Classic touring bikes can have either a flat or drop bar. And they can look vintage even if they’re brand new. As they don&#8217;t change that much in-terms of design as they just work and continue to provide year after year. </p>



<p><strong>Adventure</strong> touring bikes, are made for that rough stuff in mind. You know the loose dirt, the single tracks, the off-road wilderness paths. They are for exploring those roads less travelled. On a long tour you are most likely going to come across some of these types of road conditions so having a adventure bike is very handy. They are essentially a mix between a road bike and a mountain bike. They typically have a drop bar, mechanical or hydraulic disc brakes, and varying option of wheel sizes with clearance for a variety of tire sizes. Especially the wider kind. And many adventure touring bikes are equipped to handle a dropper post.</p>



<p><strong>Expedition touring bikes</strong>, are those type of bikes that you take on a around the world adventure spanning for two years. They are as the name suggests bikes built for one epic bike trip. Expedition bikes are almost always made of steel, with 26-inch wheels and rim brakes. Making them easier to repair and replace parts, even when you are in remote corners of the world. </p>



<p><strong>Light touring bikes</strong> are similar to gravel bikes they offer eyelets for attaching racks and are used for bikepacking. Better suited to off-road environments. They are interchanged with the term light touring bikes. As they are designed for carrying lighter loads and travelling for shorter bike tour lengths. And because they are generally lighter in weight to. </p>



<p>If you want to learn more in detail about what makes a touring bike a touring bike, I recommended you get our <strong><a href="https://codeyorgill.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=68860d918f2fc8c951e2ac328&amp;id=96f984c55f">FREE, touring bike buyers guide</a></strong><a href="https://codeyorgill.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=68860d918f2fc8c951e2ac328&amp;id=96f984c55f">.</a> It will go through with you, what aspects your should look out for when buying a touring bike. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/222309645648470/"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="95" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Sound-3-3.png?resize=720%2C95&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5718" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Sound-3-3.png?w=760&amp;ssl=1 760w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Sound-3-3.png?resize=300%2C39&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Sound-3-3.png?resize=50%2C7&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></figure></div>



<p><strong>Bike Material</strong></p>



<p>All three of these types of touring bikes can be made from steel, aluminium, carbon or titanium. However, the most preferred amongst bike tourers is a steel bike. Steel is strong, and has a resistance to breaking but is also repairable if it breaks. Although heavier then other options. Aluminium is not a tough as steel but also a option. Carbon is becoming more and more popular for touring and adventure bikes. And titanium is a little rarer only due to how much more expensive it is. </p>



<p><strong>Bike build, parts and components </strong></p>



<p>Like I mention in the <a href="https://codeyorgill.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=68860d918f2fc8c951e2ac328&amp;id=96f984c55f">Free guide to understanding touring bikes</a>. The parts that make up a touring bike are important to how comfortable the ride is. As you will be riding for days on end. You need a steed that has comfortable parts. Especially on the main body contact areas. A quality touring bike should have a <a href="http://cycletraveloverload.com/best-touring-saddles-best-road-bike-saddle-for-long-rides/">comfortable saddle</a>, handlebars that offer comfort and a varying amount of <a href="http://cycletraveloverload.com/trekking-bars-butterfly-handlebars-review-my-experience-after-5000-km/">different hand positions</a>. Also the gearing on a touring bike must have eyelets of some kind for mounting racks or bike bags and panniers if they don&#8217;t all ready come with them. Most importantly the gearing on the bike must be capable to riding easily enough to ride up steep grades as the bike might be fully loaded with gear. </p>



<p><strong>Bike Geometry </strong></p>



<p>A touring bikes geometry is general more upright and offers better comfort. Often referred to as either a “endurance” or “adventure” geometry. What makes up a more comfortable touring geometry. Is the the wheelbase and chainstay being typically longer to make room for rear racks and panniers, and the bottom bracket is typically lower to the ground, which increases stability. Also the head tube is typically longer on a touring bike, elevating the handlebar. Touring bikes also generally have a shorter top tube. </p>



<p>So if you are reading this as soon as this article was published it is still 2019. However 2020 is not that far around the corner. So what touring and adventure bikes options are out there for 2020? </p>



<p>I love a good touring bike, and have done some research to find some of the best 2020 touring bike options out there. The bikes in this list are nice but not in any particular order. They are all good in their own right. </p>
