<p>Good old panniers! They are one of the better things in life. Allowing you to transport all your gear with you on your bike to any corner of the world. There is something about seeing a set of panniers, complementing a fully loaded touring bike setup. There is something about seeing those bags that scream a traveller of the world. And a sense of freedom knowing that you can travel anywhere you want.  </p>

<h2>What to look for in bike panniers?</h2>



<p>Like I mentioned before there are many attributes to consider when looking at some bike panniers for your rig. </p>



<h3>Waterproof</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1366" height="768" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-2.32.43-pm.png?fit=720%2C405" alt="" class="wp-image-2335" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-2.32.43-pm.png?w=1366&amp;ssl=1 1366w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-2.32.43-pm.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-2.32.43-pm.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-2.32.43-pm.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-2.32.43-pm.png?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>One of the more common factors when looking at some panniers is whether they are waterproof or not. Some people will disregard any pannier that is not waterproof, full stop. This used to be me, but as I become more open the the world of all the different pannier options out there, I see an interest in others. There are some highly water resistant options, that still do almost just a good a job. If you are really concerned you may want to put your most valuable gear in waterproof bags. </p>



<p>We will talk about what you intend to use the panniers for later, but for me I mostly use them for 1 to 3 month long bike touring trips. And rain and wet conditions are expected. So for me personally I prefer fully waterproof panniers. As I would prefer to have some dry clothes at days end. It really does depend on where you will be travelling and the time of year. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1425" height="950" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultralight-rain-jackets-00.jpg?fit=720%2C480" alt="" class="wp-image-2349" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultralight-rain-jackets-00.jpg?w=1425&amp;ssl=1 1425w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultralight-rain-jackets-00.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultralight-rain-jackets-00.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultralight-rain-jackets-00.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultralight-rain-jackets-00.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bikepacking.com/gear/ultralight-rain-jackets/" target="_blank">Ultralight Rain Jackets &#8211; BIKEPACKING.com</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If you are looking for a great waterproof pannier option that give you a decent amount of space for storage I highly recommend the Ortlieb Classic Panniers which are 20 litres each. And bomb proof. I have been using them for a couple years now and they have exceeded all my expectations. They have kept all my gear bone dry on really wet tours. </p>



<p>Non waterproof options seem more popular with commuters and serve a purpose here. As most times you are going to ride when the weather is best and it is not a concern. Most handmade pannier options are non waterproof and offer some custom designs and add ons that you may not get with general panniers. Offering additional, storage options on the pannier.  </p>



<h3>Bag Volume </h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="950" height="956" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-e1434530558183.jpg?fit=720%2C725" alt="" class="wp-image-2346" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-e1434530558183.jpg?w=950&amp;ssl=1 950w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-e1434530558183.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-e1434530558183.jpg?resize=298%2C300&amp;ssl=1 298w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-e1434530558183.jpg?resize=768%2C773&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-e1434530558183.jpg?resize=1017%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1017w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-e1434530558183.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption>Your pannier volume will depend on the amount of gear you want to take &#8211; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cyclingcrow.com/category/kit-lists/ireland-2015/" target="_blank">cyclingcrow.com</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The volume of your panniers really depends on your intended use, how you will be using them, for commuting to long year plus expeditions. How long you plan to be travelling for will indicate whether you have just two panniers or a fully 4 pannier setup. With smaller Ortlieb City type panniers at the from and larger Ortlieb Classics at the rear. Maybe you intend to do short weekend or week long trip you may only need some small Ortlieb Gravel panniers and some other bike bags for your setup. </p>



<p>Learning to live with less does help. Personally I have been on 3 month long bike tours with just two rear panniers, and not requiring the use of a front set. That is even with all my camera gear and extras for filming YouTube videos along the way. </p>

<p>If you are planning a bikepacking trip. But still want some larger capacity bags, (compared to standard bikepacking seat post packs). So you can store a laptop and other gear that may not fit in standard bikepacking bags. </p>



<p>There is a growing niche of &#8216;micro, nano or mini&#8217; panniers. Which are smaller style panniers made specifically for bikepacking. That maybe a better option for you. Designed with the cutting of weight in mind. Something like the Revelate Nano Panniers are smaller bags that strap over the back of a rear rack. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/facb05c12d3c5830fefa718d12b9c5e7.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="" class="wp-image-2348" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/facb05c12d3c5830fefa718d12b9c5e7.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/facb05c12d3c5830fefa718d12b9c5e7.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/facb05c12d3c5830fefa718d12b9c5e7.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/facb05c12d3c5830fefa718d12b9c5e7.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>From Path Less Pedaled &#8211; Arkel Dry-Lite panniers which are much smaller. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Generally, the smaller the bags and panniers you take the less stuff you take. As humans we tend to want to fill the space that we have. Similar to that idea of eating with a smaller plate makes it feel as though you eat more. But I always go for the bigger plate.</p>



<h3>Pannier Hardware  </h3>



<p>Depending on the type of panniers you choose, the hardware can vary. If you opt for a Ortlieb panniers you get a hard plastic build on the back side of the pannier, with complete adjustability to the hooks. Allowing them to move across to fit best on your rack. Also plastic adjustable hooks that attach to the rack preventing the pannier from bouncing of the rack on rough terrain. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="399" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5498580201_a265196ffa_o.jpg?resize=600%2C399" alt="" class="wp-image-2344" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5498580201_a265196ffa_o.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5498580201_a265196ffa_o.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5498580201_a265196ffa_o.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Ortlieb Mounting System &#8211; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://lovelybike.blogspot.com/2011/03/pannier-mounting-systems-compared.html" target="_blank">lovelybike.blogspot.com</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>I was surprised to hear that some people a weary of such design as they believe the plastic could snap. But from my own experience using my Ortliebs they have had no such problems. They only thing is the rubber inner hook stabilisers do fall out if you are not noticing them when taking the panniers on and off. Which are easily replaceable. </p>

<p>The other option with handmade pannier designs. Is the old school, bungee hook style. Where there is two more permanent metal hooks that attach to the top of the rack. Followed down by a adjustable bungee cord that runs down to another hook that attaches further down on the rack. However, these may seem obsolete in design, they actually work very well. </p>



<p>Another option is made by Arkel, the Cam-Lock Hook Kit. Designed for upgrading your existing panniers if the hooks are worn or broken. A little more complicated to use. But another option if you want to figure it out for yourself. </p>

<h2>Cons to using panniers </h2>

<ul><li>As you may not to be as discipline when packing panniers compared to bikepacking bags. Panniers make the bike wider and may be more likely to snag and bounce around making an annoying rattle on some more rough terrain. While Bikepacking bags are more streamlined and manoeuvrable, but they also enforce a little more packing discipline then panniers. </li><li>Don&#8217;t get me wrong you can still ride with panniers on off-road conditions. But, they are not ideal on gravel or trails. </li><li>It feels when riding that panniers create a fair amount of drag. And may not be as aero as the likes of bikepacking bags. </li><li>It is heavy, if you prefer to ride faster, panniers will slow you down a little. Affecting the way the bike feels and preventing a agile bike feel</li><li>With the added weight, it can be harder to hike a bike if you choose to go off-road with panniers and you are fully loaded. Same goes with just riding up hills, you need to make sure your bike is capable of riding up hills with a full load with its current gearing setup. </li></ul>



<h2>What is your intended use for panniers?</h2>

<p>So how are you planning on using panniers? Are you just going to be using them for the daily commute? A week long bikepacking trip? A three month long bike touring adventure or multiple year bike touring expedition? Your intended time frame will mean the more gear. If you are riding for more then 6 months you may need to pack gear for summer and winter meaning you may need four panniers. </p>

<p>The more space you have on the bike to pack the more comfort and more easy going the packing is. Actually, I take that back I am not sure how easy going it would be to pack this bike above and also remember where everything is. </p>



<p>But on the other hand the less space for packing, means more decisions and discipline. A lot more thinking needs to go into how you will store all the need gear for your trip. </p>

<p>Some panniers focus on separating the inner bag with walls for organisation. Blackburn decided to go for sheer volume, which is great when you&#8217;re headed to the grocery store. The Local Saddle Bags&#8217; wide-open spaces mean more carry capacity&#8211;1585. 62 cubic inches, to be exact. They&#8217;re perfect for running errands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are many options for panniers for your next bicycle tour. I have used bad panniers in the past and regret it. My first ever tour I purchased some cheap $30 panniers online and within 2 days. They had ripped and I had to try and sow up the panniers with zip ties. I could not recommend enough the importance of investing in some very great quality panniers. Especially for bike touring, this is one of the most important gear for your steed. If you invest now you will be repaid for years and years. Thanks to the quality and durability of these great panniers listed below. They will last for a long time. </p>

<p>This Classic Ortlieb panniers are with out a doubt the industry leader for the best touring panniers. Offering the most durability and &#8216;waterproof-ness&#8217;. These panniers have been renowned for lasting 10 years or more. Some tourers have had the same pair of, front Classics and rear classics, for more then 23 years and 50 to 60 tourers. </p>

<p>These panniers are my own personal go too pannier, I have taken them on multiple 3 month long bike tours and they have held up extremely well. The screws on the inside of the panniers do need tightening now and then.<br><br>Again some tourers fear the plastic hardware of the panniers will break, but that has just not been the case. On the other hand, the plastic clips too close the bags do break occasionally. But it&#8217;s not a crucial failure which would make the pannier unusable on the road and can be replaced later.</p>

<p>Also the Ortlieb panniers have some problems from time to time with bouncing and rattling around. It seems the one hook that attaches to the front side of the rack can come loose and cause the pannier to move about. If you can try and get a extra hook and attach in a opposite direction to the existing to hook to insure they stay fasten properly. This seems like it would reduce pannier movement, as this is what Ortlieb have done themselves with their bikepacking style pannier, the <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F128477%2Fortlieb-gravel-pack-panniers-pair">Ortlieb Gravel</a>. Anyway it is probably because I ride too much gravel with my Classic Ortliebs. I need a pair of gravels I think. </p>

<p>From my experience the main hook inserts get lost, resulting in a loose fit. After taking the panniers on and off many times, these inserts fall off. They can be replaced cheaply with some spares. Although PVC piping on the rear rack rails eliminates need for these spacers. </p>



<p>But again if you are planning to ride gnarly off road gravel and rocks with these panniers. They could potentially bounce and rattle and even possibility fall off. Depending on how hardcore the roads are. If you get a set of Tubus racks this should eliminate it from happening, more on racks later!</p>

<p>To accomodate your rear Ortlieb back-roller classic panniers, the Ortlieb Sport Roller Classics are great for some front panniers on a extended tour. If you are thinking you might need that extra space for a fully loaded tour. The combination of these two pairs of panniers would do the trick just fine. </p>

<p>Combined these two Sport Roller Classic Panniers offering 25 litres of vertical storage. They are nice bags, Very sturdy construction, waterproof, easy to clip on and off and adjust.

<p>Another Ortlieb pannier option are the Sport Packer Plus, they have a total of 30 Litres storage capacity for the pair. And have a different design compared to the roll and clip traditional design that Ortlieb are famous for. These panniers have a lid design that opens by flipping back and when closed are clipped down. </p>



<p>These snug-fitting lids that allow for higher load capacity. The durable straps hold lid down tight; cinch-down gasket under the lid protects contents from dust and snow. </p>

<p>Some of the things to consider about this pannier in particular is. The front straps attach to the body of the bag with a kind of round plastic bauble which gets in the way slightly when you&#8217;re trying to slide bulky items down into the bag. But I assume there&#8217;s some kind of genius reason for this that I don&#8217;t fully appreciate yet. Also, the hard plastic bumpers on the outside of the bag tend to clatter against my rack when I go over potholes. Would be great if there were some kind of rubber insert to prevent that, though it&#8217;s easily solved with some tape.</p>

<p>The next best panniers or equally as best too the Ortliebs, (depending on your preference). Is the Arkel Touring panniers, there are some models to consider. But The Orca 25 seems to be the most popular with bike tourers.</p>



<p>Arkel are made of the highest quality craftsmanship. You do pay a premium price. However, any gear to be taken on tour just must be reliable. The Arkel includes well thought out design of the pannier mounts. Which maybe even better and reliable, compared to the Ortlieb mounting design.</p>

<p>Crosso panniers in contrast are bigger than Ortliebs, cheaper, as waterproof and a simply brilliant unbreakable mounting system. They have 2 metal hooks which could be superior to Ortliebs mounting system. </p>



<p>They do however loose waterproofness from wear and tear over time. The dry 60 model offers a total of 60 litres storage capacity (for the pair &#8211; 30 L each) which is one of the largest capacity for touring panniers. They are also cheaper then the Rockbros panniers which are below, but availability is harder. It is available in Europe more so then in Western countries. </p>

<p>Rockbros have been offering cheaper alternative bike bag options for a while know. They sell a 20 L pair of panniers that are said to be 100% waterproof, but less of a cost compared to the likes of Ortlieb. </p>



<p>They are great panniers for the price. The quality of material is good and strong. They’re very roomy. The buckles are solid. The attachment mechanism is durable. The mechanism that attaches to the lower aspect of the bike rack actually dials in the perfect fit.</p>

<p>Axiom have been making panniers for a while, and they have many different variations you can choose from. My favourite would have to be the <a href="https://amzn.to/2o1J6XC">Seymour O-Weave P55+</a>. They offer many external pockets and storage options. </p>

<p>Although not as popular. Some bike tourers recommend the Vaude pannier range, there are some models to choose from. The <a href="https://amzn.to/2o3EvUH">Vaude Aqua Plus Rear Pannier</a> comes in a set, and the most preferred for bike touring. </p>

<p>I found out about this brand from my mate CP, he had a retro Jandd bag. You can still buy the Jandd Mountain Panniers (<a href="https://amzn.to/2nlqd1N">on amazon for $184.95</a>). They are made for those off-road cycling adventures and are made with versatility and rugged durability in mind. The Mountains have a narrow profile, making them great for either front or rear panniers whatever works. Also it helps on single track. </p>



<p>These panniers merge between touring and bikepacking and there is no real separation. In my opinion the two disciplines are too similar anyway. <a href="http://cycletraveloverload.com/bikepacking-vs-touring-the-difference-pros-and-cons-of-both/">If you want to learn more about bikepacking vs bike touring read here.</a></p>

<p>Bikepacking panniers, gravel panniers, mini, micro or nano panniers. However you want to call them they are essentially smaller versions of traditional touring panniers.

<p>These Arkel bikepacking panniers come in at 540 grams. They are the ultimate waterproof, light &amp; fast touring panniers. Total volume of the panniers is 28 Litres. Comes in red or black options. These panniers really don&#8217;t have much protection on the back wall from the vibrations that can be expected from rough terrain, maybe not preferred for laptops.

<h2>Fitting panniers to your bike &#8211; Different types of mounting systems</h2>

<p>When looking for a mounting system for your setup. You need to consider; where are you going, what weight are you expected to run? The most common mounting setup is a rear rack and/or front rack, allowing the panniers to fix on the bike. </p>



<p>Ideally a rear rack should have two points of attachment. Two arms that attach to the seat stay under the saddle is ideal. Try and avoid the ones that only have one arm. </p>



<p>Also rack build and material is another consideration. Ideally you want a racking system that is made from steel. Some racks are made from soft aluminium and various mounting systems leave deep marks on it. Potentially compromising strength in the long run. </p>



<p>The importance of a good touring rack is huge, you don&#8217;t want to get one and have it break on you. It is also important to make sure the rack you get is compatible with the panniers. Or else your panniers may bounce off on rough roads. </p>



<p>When mounting racks on your bike it is also important to use the right sized mounting screws. If you do however find that your screws do get loose. A great product that helps lock and seal threaded fasteners is <a href="https://amzn.to/2o5QtNA">blue Loctite</a>. </p>



<h4>Tubus Racks</h4>



<p>Tubus racks are the industry standard, offering great quality and durability. </p>

The maximum tire width clearance is 50 mm or 1.95 in. </p>



<p>A Super solid, very light rear rack, flexible and strong. It&#8217;s accompanied me on thousands of kilometres, and only some scuffs from the pannier clips are visible. </p>
