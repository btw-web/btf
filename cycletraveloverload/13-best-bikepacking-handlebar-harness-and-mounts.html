<p>Are you after a handlebar harness to house a dry bag? They are a trendy solution for handlebar bar bag storage. In a earlier blog post I wrote about some of the best bikepacking handlebar bags. Some of the options did include a complete system, including some of the handlebar harnesses included in this article. If you are looking for a complete handlebar bar system for bikepacking I would suggest <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-handlebar-bags-for-bikepacking-with-some-bike-touring-options/">starting there</a>. These harnesses are just a part of a fully functional bikepacking handlebar bag system. It may work out more cost effect to buy the complete system that these handlebar harnesses and mounts are a part of. I have not broken down the costs to see if it would be cheaper but worth looking into first. </p>



<p>You will also need something like a dry bag. And some of the better complete systems have accessory packs that sit on top. If you are after a budget solution there are some cheaper harness options in the list below. Combined that with something like a sea to summit dry bag and you have yourself a reasonable handlebar bag option for your bikepacking adventures. </p>



<p>I personally have a different way to mounting gear to my handlebars. It just worked out so well with my tent bag as it has two straps and clips that I clip around the bar. And it holds fairly well. You can also create you own DIY handlebar harness if you want to either save money and/or get creative. Quiet a few bikepackers have gone this route and it has worked out well for them. </p>



<h4>Handlebar Harness Drop Bars?</h4>



<p>Yes most harness and dry bag systems are compatible with drop bars. They only thing to keep in mind is that you are limited to the size of the dry bag. The length with be limited to fit within the space of your handlebar hoods. If you are running flat bars you can have a huge dry bag if you wish, there is not limit. </p>



<p>Also, most handlebar harness mounts are only really compatible with disk or V brakes only. And are generally not compatible with cantilever or road style front brakes with a vertical exposed cable. </p>



<h4>How Do They Mount To The Handlebars?</h4>



<p>Generally they have two tightening straps that fix to even positions on the flat part of drop bars or on the flat handlebars directly. Then you get a stabilising strap that often will fix around the front of the head tube. Some harnesses offer extra pads for mounting the harness off the bike to prevent the weight from the bags rubbing or bending cables. </p>



<p>Some handlebar harnesses don&#8217;t come with rubber spacer blocks to distance the mount from your handlebars to prevent rubbing against cables. You could get around this by getting a handlebar extender, which attaches to the handlebars directly and gives you a flat platform extended from your handlebars to attach the harness to. </p>



<p>This system for handlebar storage while bikepacking is very cost effective. You can pick up some quality handlebar harnesses for reasonable prices, when combined with a good value dry bag you have yourself a decent handlebar bag. You can also use these harnesses as a way to carry a packraft if you are going <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bikerafting-101-how-to-bikeraft-best-packraft-for-bikepacking/">bikerafting</a>, which if you are interested you should <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bikerafting-101-how-to-bikeraft-best-packraft-for-bikepacking/">read about it here</a>. </p>



<p>But lets dive into some of the best bikepacking handlebar harnesses that there is on the market to choose from. At least one bikepacker that I was talking to have used a harness on this list and personally recommend them to others. While there are a couple and one popular harness, the Revelate Designs Handlebar Harness that is a top choice for many bikepackers. </p>

<p>Okay so this handlebar harness from Revelate is the most popular option I was talking about. When it comes to other bikepackers the majority of the people I asked said they used this harness and highly recommend it for others. This harness is a semi-rigid mount designed to carry drybags, packrafts, stuff sacks and other cylindrical shaped objects. The mount features molded rubber spacer blocks provide offset from handlebars reducing lever &amp; cable interference. It is 15 oz or 425 grams and can hold up to 20L dry bags. Priced at $85.00</p>



<h2>Rockgeist Barjam Harness</h2>

<p>The Barjam is a different style of system, in terms of what the harness includes and how it is attached to the bike. Instead of using rubber blocks to distance the harness from the handlebars. You get a bolt-on bar (for 31.8 mm) handlebar extender, Voile straps, helicopter tape and of course the harness. This system is claimed to be the lightest, most secure bikepacking harness system that protects your brake, shifter, and dropper lines. At 7.8 oz (220 g) with 25&#8243; Voile straps. Now this is not lighter then the Oveja but certainly looks more secure. Priced from $75.00</p>

<p>Alpkit offer a couple handlebar harness options. This Joey is a much cheaper option thus not the better out of the two. However it is a lightweight handlebar harness at only 65 grams. Adding some stability it is ideal for weekender adventures. Priced at only $11.99</p>
