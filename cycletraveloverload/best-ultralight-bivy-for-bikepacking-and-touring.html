<p>So are you convinced about a bivy for your cycling adventures? if you are still sitting on the fence and not 100% sure if they will be right for you. Then I suggest you head over to <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bikepacking-bivy-bags-should-you-get-one/">Bikepacking Bivy Bags &#8211; Should You Get One?</a> blog post. This is where I go into detail about why you might want a tent instead. In this article I came to the conclusion that bivy bags are not really the best when adventure cycling. But I have let them grow on my overtime. </p>



<p>And to be honest I can see a place for them in the bikepacking community. If you are planning some bikepacking races where you will be sleeping &#8216;quickly&#8217; a bivy seems to be one of the more popular options for racers. They are super light and don&#8217;t take as much time, in most cases to setup. Especially important when speed is a factor. For this reason I have included some of the more popular bivy options for bikepacking in this article. </p>



<p>Here at Cycle Travel Overload we are more about the travel and adventure side of bikepacking and bicycle touring, not so the racing. But Bivy bags can still be an option for all. Depends on your preference. </p>



<p>Today though it seems lightweight bivy bags are becoming less relevant with all the options for <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/complete-list-of-40-best-bikepacking-tents/">ultralight tents that work well for bikepacking</a>. But having that said some of the bivy bags in this article weigh around 200 grams while some of the lightest tents, best for bikepacking like the <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/111795/big-agnes-fly-creek-hv-1-platinum-tent?cm_mmc=aff_AL-_-204885-_-258061-_-NA&amp;avad=258061_d19ed7e3d">Big Agnes Fly Creek 1 Platinum</a> comes in at around 1lb 13oz / 822 grams. </p>



<p>So if gram counting is your thing you can save some weight. Which is way bivy bags appeal to endurance racers. </p>



<p>Some people have mentioned that they get wet spots and condensation with bivy bags in really wet conditions. The combination of a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/9-best-bikepacking-tarps-bike-tarps-for-your-next-adventure/">tarp</a> and bivy combination could work okay and I know some bikepackers who do this. </p>



<p>When looking for a lightweight bivy if at all possible it is so worth getting one with Goretex technology. It may mean a heavier bivy but if you can get it under 1kg it might be worth considering. </p>



<p>Bivy bags can be great for stealth camping and add a little warmth to your sleeping bag. When camping in places where you don&#8217;t want to get noticed they lay low to the ground and some are green type colours to blend in with grass environments well. But the biggest down side is the feeling of being restricted and vulnerable at times when using bivy bags. </p>



<h2>Black Diamond Bipod Bivy Shelter</h2>

<p>All these bivy bags range in price, weight and function. I tried my best to get them all under 1 kg. But the prices for some of these are quiet high. And that is true with the first bivy I want to show you guys. The Black Diamond Bipod is a single-pole design which results in shed weight but also maximizes headroom. It is a one shock-corded aluminum pole over the head and shoulders. It features a large zippered entry net door. You get a large mesh panel for bugs and ventilation. And the Waterproof breathable ToddTex™ single-wall fabric. The bivy weighs in at 1 lb 13 oz or 822 grams. This bag is normally around $320 but at <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fblack-diamond-bipod-bivy-bag">Back Country they have 25% off for only $239.96</a> (but honestly guys I am not sure how long this deal is going to last!)</p>



<h2>Black Diamond Twilight Bivy</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="154" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WAS_D2-1.jpg?resize=720%2C154&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5079" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WAS_D2-1.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WAS_D2-1.jpg?resize=300%2C64&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WAS_D2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C165&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WAS_D2-1.jpg?resize=50%2C11&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Here is another Black Diamond bivy this one is cheaper and it a super minimalist approach to &#8216;bivying,&#8217; is that even a word? Anyway it is built with lightweight, highly weather resistant NanoShield fabric, the Twilight Bivy is ideal for any foul-weather, light-and-fast pursuit. It is ideally used for a emergency shelter or as a sleeping bag cover. Built with a zippered entry across the shoulders, it’s easy to get into and use while sitting up. It features a frameless construction to minimize weight, and only weighs in at 302 grams or 10.7 oz. Also it can be used all year round making it a 4 season bivy. This bivy is about $150 everywhere online. Accept again at <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fblack-diamond-twilight-bivy">Back Country it is 25% off and not sure how long this will last. But this puts it at a price of only $112.46.</a></p>

<p>This is Borah Gears ultralight bivy, they have other bivy options but this one is constructed with .7oz no-see-um netting. The main difference with this bivy then their others is the full netting top. This gives you complete bug protection while also having unparalleled breathability. The bottom part of the bivy is made with waterproof 1.3oz silpoly. For the standard with a side zipper it weighs in at 6.5 oz or you can get the one with chest zipper at only 6 oz. (That is 170 to 184 grams). They are made in Montana and start from $75.00! <a href="https://borahgear.com/bugbivy.html">Read more over at Borah Gear&#8217;s site.</a> </p>

<p>This could really be classified a sleeping bag cover but technically still a bivy. And a good budget option if you are looking to spend very minimal money on a bivy bag. Unfortunately there is not much info out there about this bag but it is <a href="https://amzn.to/3dxB7GT">available for sale at Amazon for $46.98.</a> some taller users taller then 6&#8242; might have trouble fitting in this bag. A size long Thermarest neoair x-therm does not fit. It weighs in at about 6.5 oz which is about 184 grams. Make sure to throw down a peace of Polycro, Tyvek is strong but a tear would make this thing useless. </p>

<p>Alpkit make some rather well price and quality gear for bikepacking. You should check out their bikepacking bags if you get the chance too. But this Hunka XL bivy is breathable, packs down small and comes in at around 500 grams. And they claim that it is &#8220;a favourite of many weight conscious bikepackers and alpinists&#8221;. They have taken lofting space into consideration with this bivy. The spacious construction allows plenty of room for a big 4 season down bag to loft and keep you toasty warm. It is a spacious and practical bivy, as the space allows you to store your gear inside the bivy keeping everything nice and dry. Also if you are over 6’1” and have broad shoulders this bivy is made specifically for you! <a href="https://alpkit.com/products/hunka-xl">Price is $133.00 at Alpkit&#8217;s site.</a></p>

<p>Outdoor Research make some really great lightweight stuff for bikepacking and it is no different with there bivy bags. I have met some bikepackers who use this brand and love their gear. The Interstellar bivy is a four-season shelter with AscentShell™ technology for superior breathability, waterproofness, and lightweight comfort. Weighing in at 19.9 oz or 546 grams. This bivy has some added features from their previous models. Like the newly designed side entry makes getting in and out of your shelter faster and easier than ever before, while innovative zipper design and built-in sombrero allow you to sit up and perform tasks (like cooking and packing) without stepping outside. Again Back Country is delivering the goods with some of the best online prices, with another 25% off for this bivy. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Foutdoor-research-interstellar-bivy">Coming in at $206.21.</a></p>



<h2>Outdoor Research Stargazer </h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="292" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COB.jpg?resize=720%2C292&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5084" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COB.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COB.jpg?resize=300%2C122&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COB.jpg?resize=768%2C311&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COB.jpg?resize=50%2C20&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The other Outdoor Research bivy option in this article is the Stargazer. A slightly lighter bivy then the Interstellar at 18.9 oz/535 g compared to 9.9 oz/546 g. The main difference and selling point with this bivy is as the name suggests. A enlarged head space covered by a large mesh screen that keeps bugs out and lets star views in. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Foutdoor-research-stargazer-bivy">Again 25% off at Back Country means this costs $194.21</a>. Which is $12 cheaper then the previous Interstellar bivy. </p>



<h2>Emergency Bivy</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/61YVzVhvZL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=539%2C488&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5085" width="539" height="488" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/61YVzVhvZL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?w=1066&amp;ssl=1 1066w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/61YVzVhvZL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=300%2C272&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/61YVzVhvZL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=768%2C695&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/61YVzVhvZL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=1024%2C927&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/61YVzVhvZL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=50%2C45&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>You could go super cheap and just get yourself a emergency bivy! This is what I have done on some bikepacking trips. And it has done well enough to keep the old out and wet out to. It might be a good idea to first get on of these from Amazon just to test out if the bivy route is for you. This one for example <a href="https://amzn.to/2xoz3AC">costs $24.97</a>. Probably not the best long term strategy but a starting point if you are getting into the world of bivy bags. </p>
