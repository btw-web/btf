<p>In this article we will be looking at some of the best options out there for sleeping pads. But they are not just any sleeping pad they need to be ultralight! The lighter the better, especially when we are considering bikepacking. Some of the most important attributes of gear is that it is light weight and packs down rather small in storage are or volume. </p>



<p>However there are some other distinctions when looking at ultralight sleeping pads. R-Value is a common measurement to know how well the pad does with insulation. This is a measurement of the material’s thermal resistance. The higher the number the better it will be at insulating. If you are winter bikepacking you want to try and get a sleeping pad with a value above 3. So if you get a sleeping pad under 3 make sure you are only using it for warmer weather. </p>



<p>Although thermal ratings in sleeping pads is often over looked it is one of the factors that help keeping your sleeping pad comfortable during those colder temps. But the overall comfort of the sleeping pad is obviously another important thing to consider. Foam pads are commonly less comfortable as inflated pads. Especially if you are a stomach or side sleeper you will appreciate the air that literally elevates you off the ground and provides a nice cushion.  </p>



<p>You can also get sleeping pads in a number of about three different variants. Self-Inflating Pads, Air Pads and Foam Pads. It is pretty straight forward. A self-Inflating pad is able to, you guessed it, self-inflate. You may be required to give it a couple breaths to fill up the pad completely. Air pads require the use of a pump. This type of pad is not really recommended when it comes to using it for bikepacking adventures. As you want to pack as light as you can and the need to carry a pump is just not worth the hassle. Then foam pads are also fairly common in bikepacking too. When I was new to this amazing way of traveling. I used a yoga mat. Defiantly don&#8217;t recommended this! But yeah, that was the closest I got to using a foam pad. I know use a self-inflating Therm-A-Rest Sleeping pad. </p>



<p>One of the positives to a foam pad is you don&#8217;t need to worry about punctures and the pad deflating. But they are rather bulkier then a self-inflating ultralight pad. In summary the best sleeping pad for specifically bikepacking in my own opinion, is a ultralight self-inflating sleeping pad. </p>



<p>When it comes to weight anything that is sub 500 grams can pretty much be considered ultralight and anything from 500 grams to say 1 kg is around the lightweight range. When looking at a sleeping pads ability to pack small or compactness for lack of a better word. It should be about the size of a 1L bottle or smaller. Anything bigger is just not worth carting around. </p>



<p>Other things to consider with sleeping pads is the length. You might be surprised but it is actually comfortable sleeping on a 3/4 pad. One that only goes from your head to your knees. This is a great in shaving off some unnecessary weight. </p>



<p>The shape is also another way to make a sleeping pad weight less. If you find a sleeping pad with the corners rounded this can result in yet again a lighter sleeping pad. This might not effect the overall weight that much, but if weight is everything then something to consider. </p>



<p>Getting a sleeping pad that has ease of inflation is a game changer. If you get a pad that has larger air chambers this means more comfort to lay on. But it will be demanding on your lungs and put that VO2Max to the test. It is really unnecessary after a long day in the saddle when you are already exhausted. </p>



<p>Then obviously another factor to consider with sleeping pads is durability and longevity. This is so much harder to know for sure, without physically testing every single product for an extensive period of time. However, a general rule of thumb is name brands generally have a better reputation for lasting longer, but you really don&#8217;t know 100%. So without further blabbing on, here are some of the best ultralight sleeping pads that are perfect for your next bikepacking outing. </p>

<p>The Static V2 is a take on the previous Klymit Static V model and this new update is 12% lighter! Also it is more friendly when it comes to packing down with new high end lighter fabrics. It weighs only 16.33 oz or 463 grams. The dimensions when the pad is inflated 72 x 23 x 2. 5 inches or 190.5 x 58.42 x 6.35 cm. One of the unique features of this sleeping pad that separates it from others is the V-Shaped design of the air chambers. This limits air movement and heat loss while also providing better support and comfort. The packed weight is 16.6 oz or 470.6 grams and the size is 3&#8243; X 8&#8243; or 7.62 cm x 20.32 cm.</p>

<p>In testing it takes about 10 to 15 breaths to fill this baby up! Which is exactly as advertised. The time this takes is roughly 30 to 40 seconds. Also the pad does a great job in holding the air without any leaks. It takes some time to learn how to use the air gauge properly, this part has room for improvement. When you are approaching the last few breaths, the air tends to get push out as pressure builds up in the pad. Wish there were some kind of ball-and-socket mechanism to lock the air in at every breath. This is a overall great sleeping pad for its compact size. It also would be nice if it was just slightly a little bit wider. <a href="https://amzn.to/2SIvJZj">Priced at $64.95 on Amazon</a></p>

<p>I am super surprised to find out through research from the <a href="https://amzn.to/2HQgQ0Q">Amazon reviews</a> that a user tested this out on concrete for 11 days and as a side sleeper they never woke up being cold. And they said they didn&#8217;t get any hip or shoulder pain. Even a guy who is 230 pounds (104 kg) used this pad and they say it is &#8220;the best mat I&#8217;ve ever owned&#8221;. It seems many of people who buy these are side sleepers and they all say that they have benefited from it. It seems if you are a side sleeper and need that extra warm, this is a great option to add to your camping gear. <a href="https://amzn.to/2HQgQ0Q">You can pick up a Large sized pad for $84.98 on Amazon.</a></p>

<p>Most users of this sleeping pad are very happy with the sleeping setup this provides. <a href="https://amzn.to/39XroHb">If you don&#8217;t believe me read the reviews here</a>. But some are saying, &#8220;This thing is so compact and lightweight that I&#8217;ll never go back to a close-cell foam pad again! Yes it&#8217;s not one of the name brand ones, but those are super expensive and I wanted to try an air pad without coughing up the big bucks.&#8221; Someone else who tested this pad at down below freezing (30 degree), they mentioned it preformed better when it came to comfort then the Thermarest Prolite.

<p>Keep in mind that you can get way lighter sleeping pads then this one. If you are a ultralight bikepacker you might want to pass up on this pad. But, and it does take a few minutes to blow up some say 20 breathes. For this pad though warmth and comfort is everything. You can sleep on your back or side and be super comfortable. For users who are 6&#8242; 2&#8243; they say &#8221; it does not leave my arms resting on the ground, or my legs.&#8221; This pad is great at keeping you completely off the ground when laid on. People even tested it out while standing in the middle of the mat with both feet and not touch the ground. For the warm and weight ratio this is still worth the more expensive price tag of <a href="https://amzn.to/2PlwtBo">$244.95 on Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>If you are after some super light sleeping pads, when cutting weight is everything. New for 2020! You might want to check out the <a href="https://amzn.to/2VlIY3I">Klymit Inertia O Zone</a> which is what we are going to talk further about here. But they also have the <a href="https://amzn.to/2w1EvZk">Inertia X Lite</a> which is only 6.1 ounces or 172.93 grams which works out to be exactly half the weight (6.1 ounces or 172.93 grams) lighter then the O Zone. However it has very minimal design and no head rest and looks like it is only a 3/4 pad. </p>



<p>But the Inertia O Zone, as you can tell by the design they have cut weight with the hole design all over the pad. From first look the design would struggle to be effective in colder condition as it looks like heat would escape. However, the one thing that attracts me to this pad is the pillow that comes attached to the sleeping pad. For me I need a pillow to sleep best, and having this would have me eliminated my current travel pillow, freeing up space in my bikepacking setup. And it is lighter then all the other pads we have covered so far. </p>



<p>With this pad they have taken the comfort from the Static V and combined that with the weight savings of the Inertia Series. It features body mapping technology which places chambers only where padding is needed and eliminates them where they are not, allowing us to shed weight without sacrificing comfort &#8211; includes integrated 4-Inch tall pillow and loft pockets. So the packed weight is 12.2 ounces or 345.86 grams and a packed Size: 6 x 3 inches or 15.24 x 7.62 cm. The pad inflates in 4-7 breaths and the inflated size is 72 x 21.5 x 1.75 inches or 182.88 x 54.61 x 4.45 cm. <a href="https://amzn.to/2VlIY3I">Priced at $59.97 on Amazon.</a></p>

<p>If inflated a sleeping pad is not your thing look into something like this Therm-A-Rest Foam Z Lite Sol.. I have slept on one of these and they are great. The selling point on this mat for bikepacking is time it takes to setup. No breathes required just take it off your bike and unfold it, very quick and efficient. It still manages to stack up to some of the sleeping pads we have covered so far when it comes to R-value of 2.0. The reflective ThermaCapture coating and heat-trapping dimples capture radiant heat, keeping you warm. This type of mat has been tested and trusted by many outdoor enthusiasts for many years. The classic pad features folding accordion-style construction that is compact and easily packable. Also you don&#8217;t have to fix punctures. They have even gone as far to design the pad in a way that the foam is softer on the top for comfort, and denser on the bottom for extra insulation, durability, and protection from the ground. These molded foam mattress measure in at 72 x 20 inches or 182.88 x 50.8 cm (20 x 5 x 5.5 inches or 50.8 x 12.7 x 13.97 cm folded) and weighs 14 ounces or 396.89 grams. So yes it is not as compact when packed then other sleeping pads but it has its benefits in comparison. <a href="https://amzn.to/2TaHq9X">Priced from $44.95 on Amazon</a></p>
