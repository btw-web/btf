<p>Are you in the market for a rear bike rack so you can on go on some bicycle tours? You need something that is going to be strong and hold panniers with all your gear? In this blog post I am going to go through the most popular rear bike racks amongst bicycle tourers from all over the world. These are the racks that they have used and personally recommend from experience out on the road. Having that said these racks will also make great racks for a commuter looking to carry a pannier on their bike and extra gear to get to school or work. </p>



<p>Have in mind that not all racks will work with disc brakes and they can make it quiet tricky to fit racks with disc brakes but make sure if you have disc brakes that the rack you are looking at is compatible. And also it depends on the type of bike you have to which type of rear rack would best suit. Assuming you have a touring bike for commuting or using to tour the world. Most of these racks will be fine unless otherwise mentioned. If you bike has a lack of eyelets but you are still looking for ways to mount a rack on your bike, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/how-to-mount-a-bike-rack-without-eyelets/">this article will be of help</a>. </p>



<p>Compatibility with racks and panniers is an important factor to really consider before going out and buying. When getting both a rack and panniers make sure that they both work together. Panniers that rely on a lower hook pulling upward (usually with some sort of elastic cord) need a Blackburn-style rack to catch the hook. Problems can come about when panniers fall off, rub the tires, or get jammed. Which is something that you want to totally avoid. </p>



<p>Also if you are wondering how to attach stuff to your rear rack, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bike-rear-rack-straps-attaching-stuff-to-your-bike/">this article includes a list of bike rear rack straps</a>. And finally if you are looking for front rack options for your bike, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/12-best-front-bike-racks-for-touring-bikepacking/">here are some of the best options on the market</a>. </p>



<p>Okay now that is out of the way lets get into, what you came here for in the first place, rear bike racks for touring and/or commuting. In no order of preferred here are some of the better options. </p>



<h2 id="product-title">Blackburn Outpost Rear World Touring Rack</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/61IZSonlKOL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=366%2C439&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4570" width="366" height="439" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/61IZSonlKOL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?w=756&amp;ssl=1 756w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/61IZSonlKOL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=250%2C300&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/61IZSonlKOL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=42%2C50&amp;ssl=1 42w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<blockquote style="text-align:center" class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong>Best Rear Rack When Heaps Of Clearance Is A Must</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>This rear rack is constructed with durable Easton Scandium and 6061 aluminum, the rack maintains stiffness without weighing your frame down, and it provides you with the option of mounting your panniers low or high. Blackburn included space to attach a light or reflector at the rear and designed the rack with a narrow width to keep weight as close to the center as possible for a stable ride. Once you&#8217;re packed up, the Outpost can carry up to 55lbs of gear. It has compatibility with; 6 inch, 29 inch, 700c wheels, disc and caliper brakes. And includes a lifetime warranty. <a href="https://amzn.to/2RXb9CT">Priced on Amazon at $134.95</a></p>



<p>If you have a Hook &amp; Bungee pannier setup this might not be the best rack option for you. The rack is great if you are looking for something that offers heaps of clearance. The sides of this rack bow outward so much that panniers hang at an angle and the small securing bar at the bottom bumps out even further making for a very small area for weight to rest on. It also sits very far back on the wheel making centering weight with the rear axle impossible. It is a rack that is recommended by some tourers but I am not really sure if it is the best option, thanks to some users reviews. </p>



<h2>Axiom Journey Transit</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/transit-1.jpg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4571" width="412" height="412" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/transit-1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/transit-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/transit-1.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/transit-1.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/transit-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/transit-1.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" /></figure></div>



<blockquote style="text-align:center" class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong>Best Rear Rack For The Strength &amp; Money</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Axiom make some pretty great gear. If you are after something of better value compared to the previous Blackburn rack this might be a good option for you. Made from a Hand-welded, tubular 10.2mm 6061 T6 aluminum. The rack comes with a generous platform size that is optimised for top loading things like trunk bags and rear baskets. 280mm extension arms are long enough to fit even the smallest of bikes, and can be bent to shape without compromising strength, due to their bridged construction. Double welded for extra strength and long-term durability. Reflector/light mount, Frame bolts included. It has a load capacity of 50 kg / 110 lbs and 550g / 1.21 lbs which is including hardware. <a href="https://amzn.to/38OUOa8">Priced at only $28.00 on Amazon</a></p>



<p>For the budget friendly price of this rack, it is surprisingly strong and light. This rack has a great weight capacity and is fairly light, the aluminum construction is nicely welded. Be aware that some users have mentioned that the stays or legs on this rack can be too short for some bikes. </p>
