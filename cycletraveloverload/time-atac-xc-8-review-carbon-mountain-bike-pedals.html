<p>So are you after some of the best and lightest weight mountain bike pedals? I have been recently testing out the Time Atac XC 8 pedals and in comparison to other clipless pedal options for mountain biking and/or gravel grinding. I have been super impressed with how well the Atac XC 8 pedals really are! </p>

<p>Over the years Time pedals have be refined and improved, as a result their Atac XC 8 pedals are solid and perform very well. </p>



<p>One of the first differences I noticed was how easy these pedals are to clip into, even if you are using them for the first time. In comparison I was using  Shimano&#8217;s PD-M520 SPD pedals. And they took me a little while to get used to how the clip in and out. And even at times I was still trying to work it out after a few weeks. The thing with the Time Atac pedals is as soon as I jumped on my bike. I was able to clip in straight away and unclip super easily. Thanks to vital step-in angle you can guarantee a simple and speedy step-in. </p>

<p>Part of this has to do with the design of the pedals, carbon body and chromed, hollow oversized steel axle. Along with this design it helps to clear debris each time you step in. I tested this pretty well when riding in muddy conditions and thee pedals seemed to hold true to this function. So with this self cleaning function. Each time you step into the TIME ATAC the lever clears out any debris. </p>

<p>So who are these pedals ideal for? What type of riding conditions make these pedals shine? Well they have been rather popular amongst; competitive cyclocross, mountain bike riders and gravel road riders. While they are also a great choice for trail riding or bike touring. </p>



<p>But let&#8217;s take a look at the pedals specifications. Are they really worth spending that extra cash?</p>

<p>If you are looking for a in depth comparison between these pedals and 12 others, check out this <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-13-gravel-bike-pedals-2019-flat-and-clipless-pedals-for-gravel-bikes/">article</a>. But if you go over there, you can see that the Time Atac pedals are the lightest pedals. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00362.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6478" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00362.jpg?w=7952&amp;ssl=1 7952w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00362.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00362.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00362.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00362.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00362.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00362.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Another great feature of these pedals is how they allow you the ability to adjust how tight they grip the cleats. And you get the standard cleats that give you the choice of 13 degree or 17 degree release. </p>



<p>Also it is worth mentioning that the only way to install these is with an allen&#8217;s key at the back of the pedal arm. They do not have the flat spots on the shaft for using a pedal wrench. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00349.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6473" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00349.jpg?w=7952&amp;ssl=1 7952w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00349.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00349.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00349.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00349.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00349.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00349.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>When I was installing I was unable to find any R or L marks to figure out which goes on the right and left side. You can tell the difference by the two metal bars and the one that sticks up goes towards the front of the bike.  As you can tell from the picture above. </p>



<p>One this I did notice when first pulling these pedals out of their box was when they spin, there was a little resistance. Which apparently is rather normal for Time pedals. This is an indication that the seals on the pedal are all good. And you don&#8217;t notice any resistance while pedalling. </p>

<p>It seems counterintuitive to buy carbon pedals if you are using them for gnarly mountain biking. My first thought was rocky singletracks for the pedal to slam into would not end well for the pedal. But I am surprised to hear from a number of owners of these pedals who use them for exactly that. And they have held up very well with no issues. They are solid and strong for how lightweight they are! </p>



<p>Many owners of Time pedals say things like; &#8220;Time pedals have stood the test of time with me&#8221;. I have heard stories of people using one set of pedals for 10 years and then eventually does because of wear and tear over such a long time. They wear down! But 10 years! That is an incredible track record, if you ask me! </p>

<p>It seems like after 10 to 15 years of use, they start to get problems with a dragging bearing and someone claimed that they, wore thru a wire on one of the original pairs. </p>



<p>All in all these are some of the best pedals you can buy. For the time I have had them and tested them they have held up perfectly. I tried looking online to see if anyone had problems with the Atac XC 8 pedals. And struggled to really find anything significant. </p>



<p>Although one user mentioned that only after 100 mile of use, they hit a rock and bent the spring. And someone else said to, &#8220;watch the pins one of mine started to work it’s way out.&#8221;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00357.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6481" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00357.jpg?w=7952&amp;ssl=1 7952w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00357.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00357.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00357.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00357.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00357.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC00357.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Overall these are my favorite pedals I have tested for gravel grinding and sending it on MTB trials. Super lightweight makes for even more efficient riding. The are clearly the best on the market! So save your time looking at anything else and just get the Time Atac XC 8 pedals. </p>



<p>If you plan to ride cyclocross, gravel or MTB they are ideal for you. I rarely recommend products this confidently. But they are that good! They also made a feature in my <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/recommended-bikepacking-gear/">Recommended Bikepacking Gear</a> article. </p>

<p>But they do cost more than most other pedals on the market. With a price of <a href="https://amzn.to/3bOXeIg">$109.00 at Amazon</a>. </p>
