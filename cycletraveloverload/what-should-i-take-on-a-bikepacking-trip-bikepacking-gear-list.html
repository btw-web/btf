<p>Every bikepacking trip is different. Each country and trail offer a different set of challenges. Therefore, there is not one set kit list for bikepacking. What we can say is that there are some key essentials for making sure your adventures are fun and safe. This is an ideas list. Just because it could fit doesn’t mean it should fit! Remember, the key is to pack light and pack smart. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Tent</strong></li><li><strong>Sleeping stuff</strong></li><li><strong>Mechanical kit/spares</strong></li><li><strong>Maps</strong></li><li><strong>Clothes</strong></li><li><strong>Food</strong></li><li><strong>Water </strong></li><li><strong>Electronic things and more</strong></li><li><strong>Bikepacking bags</strong></li></ul>



<p>Let’s expand on this list together and see what is necessary in each section. </p>



<h2>Tent</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="422" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/THVCSBP219_Tent-001.jpg?resize=720%2C422&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6403" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/THVCSBP219_Tent-001.jpg?w=945&amp;ssl=1 945w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/THVCSBP219_Tent-001.jpg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/THVCSBP219_Tent-001.jpg?resize=768%2C450&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/THVCSBP219_Tent-001.jpg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>For a multi day adventure you’re going to need to set your head down somewhere. This can be a lightweight one person tent, or this can be an even lighter weight bivvy or swag. What you choose largely depends on your trip style, climate and personal preference. If you’re going to be encountering nasty weather or excessive bugs then you’ll probably want a tent. If you like kipping under the stars on warm summers nights then a bivvy bag, hammock or tarp set up could suit you just fine!</p>



<h2>Sleeping stuff</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="540" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bugbivy3.jpg?resize=720%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5080" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bugbivy3.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bugbivy3.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bugbivy3.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bugbivy3.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bugbivy3.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bugbivy3.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This encompasses a sleeping bag, mat and pillow. Not your favourite striped silk pyjamas! Your sleeping bag needs to be lightweight and packable but also still suitable for the temperatures you’re likely to come across. If you’re bikepacking through Alaska you’ll need a different bag than if you’re through the French summer. Then you want to make sure you’ve got something comfortable to sleep on. A sleepless night does not make for an energetic cyclist. Mat or air mattress is the decision here. These days there are some really good and compact air mattresses which offer smaller luggage space and greater comfort than a traditional roll mat. If you already have a roll mat you like, then just strap it onto your handlebar bag and you’ll be fine. If you have trouble sleeping with your head on a bag, then an inflatable pillow might be a good investment too.</p>



<h2>Spares and kit</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="720" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/le-bicycle-puncture-repair-kit-26935-lifestyle.jpg?resize=720%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6435" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/le-bicycle-puncture-repair-kit-26935-lifestyle.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/le-bicycle-puncture-repair-kit-26935-lifestyle.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/le-bicycle-puncture-repair-kit-26935-lifestyle.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/le-bicycle-puncture-repair-kit-26935-lifestyle.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/le-bicycle-puncture-repair-kit-26935-lifestyle.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Again, this depends on the length of your trip. If you’re only away for the weekend and your bike is in good shape then you could get away with a multi tool and tyre levers, 2 spare tubes and/or repair kit and a hand pump. If you’re going for much longer then packing some spare brake pads, chain links and lube should be added.</p>



<h2>Maps</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="960" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-josh-hild-2422483.jpg?resize=720%2C960&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6432" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-josh-hild-2422483.jpg?w=3648&amp;ssl=1 3648w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-josh-hild-2422483.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-josh-hild-2422483.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-josh-hild-2422483.jpg?resize=38%2C50&amp;ssl=1 38w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-josh-hild-2422483.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-josh-hild-2422483.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you’ve got a decent GPS system then this is golden and highly recommended. Your phone in an appropriate holder can substitute if not.</p>



<p>Plan your route well and take (or have digital) copies of each day. If you run out of power will you be able to find your way? Having an OS map of the area never hurt anyone!</p>



<h2>Clothing</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="516" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00289.jpg?resize=720%2C516&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6380" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00289.jpg?w=7405&amp;ssl=1 7405w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00289.jpg?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00289.jpg?resize=768%2C550&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00289.jpg?resize=1024%2C733&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00289.jpg?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00289.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00289.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Where are you going? How long are you going for? Let’s face it, you’re not going to be the freshest you’ve ever been but please pack a change of underwear! The days might be gloriously sunny but the nights might be bitterly cold. You might need rain proofs to prepare for getting wet and then having dry options so you don’t get hypothermia after! A couple of pairs of socks and if you wear underwear under your padded shorts then you’ll need a change or two. If you’re planning on stopping for dinner or exploring in civilisation then some ‘normal’ clothes might be useful.</p>



<p>The obviously necessary things like sunglasses, gloves, hat or buff, shoes and your helmet all need to be accounted for too.</p>



<h2>Food</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1508666.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6433" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1508666.jpg?w=5093&amp;ssl=1 5093w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1508666.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1508666.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1508666.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1508666.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1508666.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1508666.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This depends on whether you’ll be riding in the wilderness completely self-sufficient or whether you’ll be hopping via villages or towns on the way. If you can buy food on the way then you’ll save a lot of space and weight and only need to pack some basic emergencies. </p>



<p>Otherwise, you need to think about energy dense, low space and low prep foods. Think pasta, couscous, tinned fish, nuts and dried fruit, peanut butter or hummus and bread, oats, dehydrated meals and cereal bars. Oh! And coffee! To cook these you’ll need a little stove with fuel and a mess tin to boil water on. We take a collapsible bowl, pocket knife and spork with us everywhere we go!</p>



<h2>Water</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1458671.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6434" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1458671.jpg?w=5760&amp;ssl=1 5760w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1458671.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1458671.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1458671.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1458671.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1458671.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1458671.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>For us, it’s better to overpack than underpack in this category. We always take water purification tablets with us ‘just in case’ too. If you can get a water bottle that has a filter in it then that’ll do the trick! Everyone is different but on average, each day you’ll need about 4-6litres. Then you may need more for overnight and cooking, and more again until you can refill the next day. Getting a ‘Platypus’ water pouch or bottle cages on your forks can be an easy way to carry more water. Do not let yourself get dehydrated.</p>



<h2>Electronic things and more</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00299.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00299.jpg?w=7952&amp;ssl=1 7952w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00299.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00299.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00299.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00299.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00299.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00299.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>You’ll need a way to power up your phone or GPS system (unless you revel in being off the grid). For safety it’s always advisable to carry power, especially if you’re on your own. Some people opt for dynamo hubs to power their lights and GPS and then have a power pack for their phone. Always worth taking some cheaper spare lights if you’ll be riding in darkness or at dusk a lot. Then you should probably think about a basic first aid kit, hygiene wipes, sunscreen, tweezers, and any medication you’ll need. Depending on your trip length you should think about washing occasionally too!</p>



<h2>Bikepacking Bags</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="541" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00280.jpg?resize=720%2C541&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6378" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00280.jpg?w=7060&amp;ssl=1 7060w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00280.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00280.jpg?resize=768%2C577&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00280.jpg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00280.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00280.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DSC00280.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Finally, you’re going to need somewhere to put all this gear! It depends on your load for what bags you need. To be comfortable taking most things you’ll need a decent 17-20 litre saddle bag. This is a good place to store your tent. Depending on your handlebar width the next largest bag you’ll need is a handlebar bag. These can fit drop bars or wide bars and can be anything from 5-20 litres. Some people add a small accessory bag on top of their bar bag for easy to access bits. Then come the frame bags. These vary greatly. Some come in tiny tube shapes so you can still fit your water bottles in their usual position alongside keeping your spares accessible. Or, they can encompass the whole frame shape and fit around 7 litres. If you’re travelling light you should be fine with these 3, some waterproof bags and a lightweight rucksack.

<p>We hope this list helps you to think about what you’re going to pack. If you’re going to be riding in extreme conditions then more in the clothing category will be needed! </p>
