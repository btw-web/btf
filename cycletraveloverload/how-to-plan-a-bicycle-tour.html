<p>So you want to go on a bicycle tour? It is one of the best ways to travel the world in my opinion. Now it is not something that you should just get a bike and jump on it immediately and start riding. There is some planning that needs to be considered before making the voyage. Trust me I made this mistake and learnt the hard way. </p>



<p>Quick story, well I feel in love with the idea of bicycle touring and I was already a cyclist at the time. But I thought you know it can not be that hard. Note back then I was so impatient. I just brought cheap and tacky panniers and put them on my road bike. Long story shorter, on about day 3 the panniers were destroyed, I had packed way to much clothing then I should have and not enough food and hydration. I didn&#8217;t take the time to wash and slow down to take in the scenery. It was a disaster! </p>



<p>But anyway I have been on many other enjoyable tours since then and I hope in this article to share things you should consider in order to plan for a up coming bicycle adventure across country or even around the world. </p>



<h3><strong>Where do you want to go?</strong></h3>



<p>Picking a location for your adventure is one of the first steps to planning your bicycle tour. If you are just starting in this type of travel I would recommend explore your home country first. This can be best as it is more accessible, well it is on your door step. Recently I just cycled from Melbourne, Australia to Cairns, Australia. I live in Australia and have always wanted to travel my own country. Europe, Japan and United States are some other great locations to consider.</p>



<h3><strong>Funding your travels</strong></h3>



<p>Money is important for travel. Are you going to work hard and save up enough cash to sustain your travels? Are you going to work while you travel? Providing a freelancing service, running a ecommerce business from the road, or even blogging about your adventures and making money with sponsorships. There are many ways to make money online these days. Don&#8217;t get me wrong it is not a get rich quick thing. I am still trying to work it out for myself but it is a process. </p>



<p>Another important thing to consider is your budget. For me when riding up the East coast of Australia, I spent roughly $20 to $30 per day for about 50 days on the road. Which is about $1250 for just under 2 months of expenses. Most of my spending was on food. Are you going to be spending money on accomodation, eating out, or on experiences? These are all things to consider for your budget, yours may need to require more cash or even less. It is important to figure out the number for you daily, weekly and monthly. And stick with it. </p>



<h3><strong>Picking the right bike</strong></h3>



<p>The bike you decide on buying is dependant on the terrain and route you ride, which we will cover in the next section. If you only have the bike in your garage for your first adventure. I my opinion, I think it is okay to just use that and get a taste for this way of travelling. and just go for it. Too many times we can get held back from not having all the right gear and I think it is just best to get out there. </p>



<p>If you plan a standard bicycle tour, on paved and sealed roads, then you should consider a strong, steel framed touring bicycle. I have the Surly Long Haul Trucker, which I paid $250 used for. </p>



<p>But if you want to explore trails and ride through nature reserves. You can sometimes get away with a touring bike with wider tires. You may want to consider a expedition, MTB, or even a gravel bike. </p>



<h3><strong>Route planning</strong></h3>



<p>Deciding what roads or trails you want to ride is next in the planning stage. Just a quick note here, I try not to over plan what routes I ride. As I find it takes away from the great unknown which makes cycle touring so exciting. I normally have to get from A to a general B by the end of the day and just plan accordingly each day. I just love the potential for multiple outcomes to where I may end up at the end of the day. This quote &#8220;I&#8217;ll go where the road takes me&#8221; really is what it is all about for me. </p>



<p>Google maps is great for a general direction and navigation. The street view function works wonders to see if the road has a decent shoulder to ride on. </p>



<h3><strong>Travel as light as possible</strong></h3>



<p>You only have a limited capacity for gear on your bike so you want to only pack the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMRN9FW82A">essentials</a>. Taking only what your are going to use and nothing more. You may pack somethings that you think you would need but have never used and this is common. You can always send what you don&#8217;t need back home. Less is more! The more you have loaded on your bike to more you have to carry up a ascent. You can see <a href="http://bicycletraveller.com/what-i-pack-for-a-bicycle-tour-gear-setup-bikepacking-essential-items/">what gear I pack on my bike here. </a></p>



<h3><strong>Where to Sleep?</strong></h3>



<p>There are many dimensions to sleeping locations while on a bicycle tour. If you really want to get the full adventure experience I recommend wild camping in my tent most nights. From stunning beaches, forests, or even right next to the HWY if that is all you have. I just love camping under the stars and being in nature. You could stay at caravan parks, in the states they have hiker/biker rates for camp grounds. There are even some free camp grounds around Australia too. <a href="https://www.warmshowers.org/">WARMSHOWERS</a> is amazing for free accommodation with other like minded bicycle travellers. If you don&#8217;t know what it is, people open up their houses so you can stay with them for the night. You can start in hotels if you really want to, I might do this once or twice a month just if I need a rest day. But other then that, where is the fun in that? </p>



<h3><strong>Where to Eat?</strong></h3>



<p>Where and what you eat is dependent on you and your budget. For me having a tighter budget most days I buy groceries and cook up meals with my camp stove. If I am in a new country I will eat out to get the cultural experience. As a vegan this does require some further planning and research for where I can eat. But most times you can make any meal vegan. </p>



<h3><strong>Travel insurance and visa</strong></h3>



<p> Travel insurance is important if you are travelling when there is some possibility of physical injury. As there is a danger element I recommend getting travel insurance. Also to cover your for theft. As bicycle travellers we are move vulnerable. But this is also what makes it easier to communicate with all the kind souls on the road. As they all just want to give us a helping hand. </p>



<p>For money and further protection of my funds I use a <a href="https://auspost.com.au/money-insurance/loadgo-cards">Load and Go</a> style card where, as the name suggests, I load up money on the card as I need it from my bank account. </p>



<p>The last thing I wanted to talk about was Visa&#8217;s. If you are travelling to a country which requires one make sure you are prepared and have got one with the visa clearance timeframe.</p>



<h3><strong>Enjoy your tour!</strong></h3>



<p>Having all that said I hope this has helped you make the planning for your next bicycle tour that much easier. If you have any other specific questions feel free to send me a <a href="http://bicycletraveller.com/contact/">message</a>.  </p>
