<p>There are many different types and styles of bikes that can be used for bikepacking and touring. But the two we will be looking at in detail today are gravel and road bikes. Back when I was getting into biking I got a road bike. But I wish that gravel bikes were a thing back then. Because they are essentially a multi purpose built bike. </p>



<p>Everyone knows what are road bike is! And if you don&#8217;t just quick, they are bikes made to go fast and far. It is simply a bike, as the name suggests, that is purpose built for you guessed it, tarmac! This limits its ability to travel on various types of terrain limiting it to the road only. Don&#8217;t get me wrong you can take a road bike on gravel but &#8220;it&#8217;s going to be a bumpy ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>That is why I wish gravel bikes were a thing when I went out and paid for a brand new Giant Defy road bike. As a gravel bike allows for the possibility to ride on roads, but also &#8216;gravel&#8217; and other rough terrains with more comfort. As the bike is built for this type of riding in mind. My road bike unfortunately does not allows for tires that much wider then standard road tires to fit. So it is not like I could just change to wider tires, some road bikes today allow for a bigger tire clearance. </p>



<p><strong>What is a gravel bike?</strong></p>



<p>Some say gravel bikes are a bike that is a mix between a road bike and something like a cyclocross bike (the style of a road bike with drop bars and which is a bike that rides on mud type terrains). But I believe they are more like a mix between a road bike and a mountain bike. As the terms &#8216;gravel&#8217; and &#8216;cyclocross&#8217; are often used in the same category on cycle retail sites. Gravel bikes use larger tires to improve comfort, grip, and stability. In excess of 30mm, and often up to 42mm. </p>



<p>Adventure bikes are almost very similar to gravel bikes, there is very close similarities between the two types. Gravel bike and adventure bike are just labels used to sell bikes. Adventure bikes are&nbsp;more about exploring and maybe carrying enough stuff with you to stay away overnight or longer. While gravel bikes are more then capable of doing the same. Making them essentially the same thing! </p>



<p>Pedigree gravel bikes are designed for gravel grinder racing which is a US thing. But most other budget gravel bikes and other non-pedigree gravel bikes are great for taking on bikepacking adventures and could be classified as a adventure bike.</p>



<p>Gravel bikes are also categorised as adventure road bikes. Like this <a href="https://www.wiggle.com.au/fuji-jari-25-adventure-road-bike-2020/?clickid=34HRcpSNsxyJT54wUx0Mo3k3Uknw0gR1%3A3o13A0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_campaign=Viglink%20Primary&amp;utm_medium=Affiliates&amp;utm_source=APD">Fuji Jari 2.5 Adventure Road Bike</a> it is technically a gravel bike but you can take it on epic bikepacking adventures. And all for under $1000, if you are looking for budget gravel bike options I compiled a list of about 23 gravel bikes all under $1000. To get you started with a great gravel bike with more money in your pocket! </p>



<p>We will talk more about gravel and road bike differences to further help you understand each bikes traits and purposes. </p>



<p><strong>Can you use a gravel bike as a road bike?</strong></p>



<p>A gravel bike could be the only bike you really need! They are great for not only riding on gravel. They are quick and rugged but also have the capability to mount racks and panniers for carrying loads. And you can always strap on some bikepacking bags. Also bike companies are calling some gravel bikes &#8216;gravel/road&#8217; bikes. As they offer the best of both worlds. </p>



<p>This also means you can use a gravel bike as a road bike. Most gravel bikes do have gravel tires stock which are generally around a 700&#215;40. This could slow you down when you want to ride with your mates in the early morning bunch rides. But what is stopping you from chucking on some roadie tyres and making it happen? </p>



<p>Gravel bikes again are great they can be used for most biking uses, like, bikepacking, bike touring, cyclocross and road cycling. Making them a great bike option compared to just a road bike. Also it does depend on what type of riding you will be using a bike for most, that will dictate which out of the two types of bikes is best. Put simply if you only want a bike that you will use on the tarmac and strictly nothing else, then a road bike is your best bet. But if you are feeling adventurous and want to explore but also be able to ride fast on tarmac then look no further then a gravel bike. </p>



<p>Before we get into the gravel bike and road bike side by side comparisons. <strong>What is the difference between a gravel bike and cyclocross bike?</strong></p>



<p>Both types are so similar, but lets try and figure out the differences. Simply a gravel bike is designed for comfort over long distances while a cyclocross bike will offer more on the side of speed and agility. </p>



<p>Typically the frame geometry on these bikes are different as the different variables of the frame various to suit each bikes purposes. Cyclocross bikes require high manoeuvrability around tight turns and over barriers and other obstacles which is why, generally, the frames on these bikes are shorter in wheelbase fro example for quick response and turning when racing. </p>



<p>There is some other features that make these bikes different from each other but we will save that for another article. But if you are looking at a cyclocross bike for racing you are only allowed in the UCI up to 33 mm, and gravel bikes can accommodate at least 40 mm tires. So make sure to look at this detail when looking for a bike. </p>



<p>Lets look at the differences between road and gravel bikes and see which type is best for you!</p>



<h3>Gravel Bike vs Road Bike Geometry</h3>



<p>As I mentioned in the article <a href="http://cycletraveloverload.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-road-bike-and-a-touring-bike/">Touring Bike vs Road Bike – What Is The Difference?</a> Road bikes typically have a more aggressive riding position. The geometry of the bike is made for speed and aerodynamics in mind. While a gravel bike is more suited for comfort over longer distances of repetitive riding everyday for adventures, much like a touring bike.</p>



<p>However, a cyclocross bike which is categorised similar to a grave bike. Is more rigid and designed for racing like a road bike, so there is subtle differences to be able to notice here. </p>

<p>The best way to see the differences in gravel and road bike geometry is with a example. So I gathered the specs for a <strong>Pure Fix Cycles&nbsp;Henday Gravel Adventure Pro Bike 2019</strong> (blue Bike) as our gravel bike example and a <strong>Pure Fix Cycles Pro Road Bike</strong> (yellow bike) for the road bike option. The reason I chose two bikes form the same brand as it should be a direct comparison to the differences they make when it comes to geometry of the different types of bikes. We are comparing a medium sized bike for the example. </p>

<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Medium (700c) Sized Bike</strong></td><td><strong>Gravel Bike</strong></td><td><strong>Road Bike</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>A</strong> &#8211; Seat Tube&nbsp;(C-T)</td><td>510</td><td>530</td></tr><tr><td><strong>B</strong> &#8211; Top Tube&nbsp;(Effective)</td><td>560</td><td>545</td></tr><tr><td><strong>C</strong> &#8211; Head Angle</td><td>71.5</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td><strong>D</strong> &#8211; Seat Angle</td><td>73.5</td><td>73.5</td></tr><tr><td><strong>E</strong> &#8211; Chainstay</td><td>455</td><td>425</td></tr><tr><td><strong>F</strong> &#8211; BB Drop</td><td>72</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td><strong>G</strong> &#8211; Fork Offset</td><td>50</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td><strong>H</strong> &#8211; Wheel Base</td><td>1060</td><td>993</td></tr><tr><td><strong>I</strong> &#8211; Head Tube Length</td><td>130</td><td>115</td></tr><tr><td>Standover</td><td>780 (30.70&#8243;)</td><td>776 (30.5&#8243;)</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>As you can see right off the bat, there is a common theme with the gravel bikes numbers being generally more (except for the seat tube and head angle.) These larger numbers result in a bike that is more comfortable to ride over the long haul. </p>



<p>The Chainstay on the gravel bike example is 30 mm longer, as well as the wheelbase being 67 mm longer too. This extended length of the gravel bike is what makes riding, especially when under a load much more comfortable to ride then a road bike. The shorter metrics here for a road bike help make the bike respond quicker and ride more easily for racing then a gravel bike. </p>



<p>The fork offset is also longer on the gravel bike by 7 mm this helps add to the extended wheelbase length. But also the longer the fork offset the more the handling can feel unstable. Which requires more input from the rider. Which is why a road bike has a shorter offset, making steering more responsive and quick compared to a gravel bike. The shorter offset also brings the hub toward the rider’s mass making it easier to weight the wheel and provide steering stability.</p>



<p>The head tube length when compared is 15 mm longer on the gravel bike. This helps make the bike put the rider in a more upright riding position allowing for a more comfortable posture. When agin riding for extended periods of time on adventures. </p>



<p>The combination of a longer top tube and a smaller seat tube for the gravel bike help result in a more relaxed and upright riding position when compared to that of the road bikes. </p>



<p>The bottom bracket drop on a road bike generally and in this example is slightly less then the gravel bike by 2 mm. This lower centre of gravity for the gravel bike helps when under a load and carrying extra weight, in the form of gear for camping. </p>



<p>It is safe to say that gravel bikes tend to have a more mountain bike style of geometry for comfort while road bikes tend to have a more racier geometry.</p>



<h3>Gravel Bike vs Road Bike Speed</h3>



<p>Lets compare the speed of a gravel and road bike. Keep in mind this can vary depending on rider, and bike in general like weight, gearing and all that stuff. Have in mind that is pretty much impossible to quantify the difference in speed between the two. </p>



<p>But again lets compare two bikes for another demonstration to see which type comes out on top. So for this example lets compare some really value options, that offer an all round amazing bike. The <strong>BMC TEAMMACHINE SLR03 ONE</strong> road bike and the <strong>2019 Canyon Grail AL 7.0 SL</strong> gravel bike. I tried my best the find bikes that cost around the same (MSRP $1,999 and $1,899). The road bike is carbon and the gravel being a Aluminum frame with carbon fork. Generally gravel bikes are made from Aluminum for opposed strength reasons for riding rougher terrain. </p>



<p>It is a little difficult to figure out which bike is faster without having them on hand. And there are so many variables that could effect either from being victorious. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1182" height="181" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-31-at-10.46.55-am.png?fit=640%2C98" alt="" class="wp-image-3582" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-31-at-10.46.55-am.png?w=1182&amp;ssl=1 1182w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-31-at-10.46.55-am.png?resize=300%2C46&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-31-at-10.46.55-am.png?resize=768%2C118&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-31-at-10.46.55-am.png?resize=1024%2C157&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-31-at-10.46.55-am.png?resize=50%2C8&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>When it comes to climbing though as you can see the road bike dominates with 3 mph more on the downhills. This escape velocity number is calculated by the bikes speed when pedaling at 100 rotations per minute in the highest gear.</p>



<p>Thanks to this graph you can see that the Canyon gravel bike in this example is easier to ride up hills. Which is something that you want to see in a gravel bike, to compensate for added weight you want that little extra ease when climbing. </p>



<p>But gearing is just one factor in figuring out which bike has more speed then the other. All bikes vary greatly when it comes to gearing and in this example the road bike had a 2&#215;11 drivetrain compared to the gravels 1&#215;11 meaning it has more gears to ride faster on the down hill. So you could add better gearing to a gravel bike if it requires it to improve its speed. </p>



<p>The tires on a gravel bike are more knobby and this is a factor that will slow you down, on road surfaces. And you are probably not going to win any crits on a gravel/adventure bike. These tires may slow you down when riding with road bikes but when it comes to loose gravel or bad road conditions, this is were this bike shines. So again it comes back to the type of riding you are using your bike for. </p>



<p>If you are looking at getting a gravel bike to do group rides on you may want to stick to a road bike. If you don&#8217;t change over tires that is. It seems in most cases if you change to 23 mm tires on. a gravel bike you should be able to keep up. But if you have something like 35mm gravel tires the speed can be significant. Especially uphill and acceleration. If you could average about 20mph on a roadie with 23mm tires, you&#8217;d probably go 16-18mph on 35s depending on the terrain. So you would probably get dropped. </p>



<p>Also the positioning on a gravel bike might not be areo enough to result in speed. You may struggle to find a good position where you can ride fast on a gravel bike. </p>



<p>But at the end of the day it comes down to your fitness level and a few bike factors, like tires and gearing. That can impact the overall speed of a gravel bike when being compared to a roadie.  </p>



<p>Getting a gravel bike is a great idea, as it is a versatile option that can potentially take you anywhere. But if you have ambition to ride it like a road bike you might want to get a different wheelset and put 23&#8217;s or road tires on it. </p>

<p>If you want to watch a really well made video explaining the speed differences in the two bikes, check out GCN video. They compare each bike using science with power meters and they came out with some interesting findings. </p>



<h3>Other Gravel Bike vs Road Bike Comparisons</h3>



<h4>Weight</h4>



<p>The weight of both bikes overall is slightly different. Generally road bikes being slightly lighter then gravel bikes. </p>



<h4>Frame</h4>



<p>The frame tubing on high end road bikes are designed to be more aerodynamic then that of gravel bikes. And back to the geometry and shape of the frame for a road bike, is often designed to make you as the rider, be positioned in a way that makes your body more aerodynamic as well. </p>



<p>There is not much difference in frame material like there is when comparing to touring bikes which are commonly made from steel. Gravel bikes and road bikes are generally made from the same Aluminum and/or carbon forks. But some high end road bikes are all carbon which can make them lighter and faster overall all. There are carbon gravel bikes but in my opinion gravel bikes take too much of a beating to get a carbon one. </p>



<p>With a gravel bike frame you will get more eyelets for mounting gear. on the fork and all over the bikes frame. </p>



<p>This leads me onto the next point which is the tires. The frame of a gravel bike offers more clearance for wider tires generally 35 mm or more. While a road bike only manages to house 23 mm road tires, generally. </p>



<h4>Tires</h4>



<p>There are so many options when it comes to gravel bike tires. Suited for gravel racing, to bikepacking with 20 kg of gear strapped to the bike. There are tires that suit depending on the type of gravel riding. Generally gravel bike tires as knobby and wider compared to road tires. The tires is one of the main catalyst that make gravel bikes so amazing. They allow you to explore off-road. Gravel bikes tires run anywhere from 32 mm to 40 mm while road tires are around 23 mm</p>



<p><strong>Why should I buy a gravel bike?</strong></p>



<p>A gravel bike is a better option out of the two in my opinion! As I love exploring the paths that are less travelled. And lust for off-road wilderness style of riding. A gravel bike allows you to do this! If this is the type of riding you have in mind then a gravel bike is your best bet!</p>



<p>You have the ability to ride a huge variety of riding conditions and terrains. You are not limited to only the road. </p>



<p><strong>What is a good gravel bike?</strong></p>



<p>If you are looking for some good gravel bike options, you can read a recent article on this blog about some of the best gravel bikes under $1000.</p>



<p>I am currently working on writing more editions to this with best gravel bikes under $1500 and $2000 and even a $3000 or a complete best gravel bike list. But if you are looking for a great gravel bike option that offers value for money. Some gravel bikes I am liking at the moment are; the Specialized Diverge, Cannondale Topstone, Trek Checkpoint, Felt Breed, Rondo Ruut. Just to name a few!</p>
