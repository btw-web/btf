<p>When looking for gifts for the bikepacking, adventure cycling fanatic! What do you get them? Maybe you are looking for some gifts for Christmas. As a fellow bike traveller and someone who is getting into bikepacking (and loving it!) Any of the items on this list I would be more then happy to receive as a gift. </p>



<p>Some of these are really useful like the Click Stand and are items that the bikepakcer you have in mind might not have. Lets just say they are not your most common bikepacking gifts. </p>



<p><em>*If you want to buy any of these bikepacking gifts, doing it via the Amazon links give Cycle Travel Overload a small commission which goes into creating more great resources for the bike travel community.</em></p>



<p>Here is the quick list of all the potential gifts for that special bikepacker:</p>



<ul><li>Click Stand</li><li>Wahoo Elemnt Roam GPS</li><li>Voile Straps</li><li>Gore R7 Shakedry Trail</li><li>Dissent 133 Waterproof Gloves</li><li>Ryders anti fog riding glasses</li><li>2020 Salsa Cutthroat with Shimano GRX 810 Di2</li><li>Kona Sutra LTD 2020</li><li>A Gift Card For REI</li></ul>



<h2>Click Stand</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="480" height="640" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-11.jpeg?resize=480%2C640" alt="" class="wp-image-3619" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-11.jpeg?w=480&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-11.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-11.jpeg?resize=38%2C50&amp;ssl=1 38w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>So what is a Click Stand you may ask? It is a simple little gadget that would be perfect for any bike traveller. As bikepacking and touring your bike is fully loaded with heavy gear and that can make it particularly difficult to manoeuvre and lean against objects. There are many ways around this. Like a more traditional bike stand. but the Click Stand is different! </p>



<p>They are a foldable portable kickstand for your bicycle. So once folded you can pack it away and pull it out when ever you need. There is no need to worry about if the Click Stand will be able to support your bike or not. They come in six different models from a carbon fibre mini stand or the max Click Stand, which is best for heavier, fully loaded touring bikes. </p>



<p>The stands are able to come in various amounts of folding segments which allow for the stand to fold smaller which is ideal for bikepacking! And they also come in a huge variety of colors to suit your style. </p>



<h2>Wahoo Elemnt Roam GPS</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="678" height="452" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images.jpeg?resize=678%2C452" alt="" class="wp-image-3620" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images.jpeg?w=678&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This little gadget is what I plan to get very soon. It is a great gift for a bikepacker as navigation is a very important aspect. This Wahoo Roam GPS has all you need for all your bikepacking adventures. </p>



<p>It has a simple set up and on-device navigation with color display. The device features a smart &#8220;back-on-track&#8221; setting which re-routes your direction to get you to where you need to go, if you ever veer off track. </p>



<p>The crystal-clear 2.7&#8243; Gorilla Glass color display provides a stunning viewing experience. Allowing you to see your route and data with ease. It also has a ambient light sensor, so depending on your environment lighting the devices backlight will adjust to match the conditions. </p>



<p>The battery life on this GPS is pretty good with 17 hours of battery before you need to recharge. But it is another thing that you will have to charge. When on multiple day adventures this is something to consider, but I guess it is better then getting lost.   </p>



<p>It weighs no more then 3.3 oz (93.55 grams) and is waterproof for up to 5 ft. Priced at $380.00 at REI. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F160875%2Fwahoo-fitness-elemnt-roam-gps-bike-computer">But you should read the reviews to see how good this bike computer really is!</a></p>



<h2>Voile Straps</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="554" height="554" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-1.jpeg?resize=554%2C554" alt="" class="wp-image-3621" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-1.jpeg?w=554&amp;ssl=1 554w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-1.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>These are probably the most handy thing you could buy for any bikepacking enthusiast and they would be greatly appreciated. Voile Straps allow you mount just about anything to your bike with ease. Great for if you want to over load your bikepacking rig with extra gear without the need to get other mounts. Or like you see above the are a security feature that keeps your water bottle fixed well in place on the water bottle mount. </p>



<p>So lets go back! Violet Straps were invented almost three decades ago as a unique way to bind skis together. But since then they have been used to secure, bundle, and repair almost anything on the go. And have become very popular in this bikepacking space. </p>



<p>The versatility of these straps never fail to amaze, with all the creative ways the people have come up with using them. They come in four different styles and material. And you can also order some with your own custom branding on them. Maybe customize with that special someones name on them, that would cool! <a href="https://amzn.to/2N8JOMI">They are a really cheap way to strap more stuff to your bike and are a gift that would come in very good use. Starting at $5.95</a></p>



<h2>Gore R7 Shakedry Trail</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="678" height="452" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-2.jpeg?resize=678%2C452" alt="" class="wp-image-3622" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-2.jpeg?w=678&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-2.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>When it rains you you still want to get out and go bikepacking there is no need for it to stop you. With a Gore-Tex jacket it will keep you waterproof. It is designed to be a running jacket but it is more then capable at being that jacket that keeps you dry when it pours. </p>



<p>It features everything you need in a rain jacket for your bikepacking adventures. Abrasion resistant, durably waterproof, highly breathable &amp; lightweight, it is a go-to for any kind of adventure in the outdoors for that matter. Not to mention its packability for when it is not in use. Weighing in at 175 grams and <a href="https://amzn.to/2JHvfOe">priced at $299.99</a></p>



<h2>Dissent 133 Waterproof Gloves</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="678" height="452" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-3.jpeg?resize=678%2C452" alt="" class="wp-image-3623" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-3.jpeg?w=678&amp;ssl=1 678w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-3.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Lets face it! When travelling by bike in those colder months of the year, your hands can get really cold. A solution to this is the Dissent 133 waterproof gloves. </p>



<p>So how did they get the name &#8220;133&#8221;? Well based of the UK, there are, on average, 133 days of rainfall per year. They were designed to allow you to ride those wet days and this is a tool that will help you get it done.

<h2>Ryders Anti Fog Riding Glasses</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-4.jpeg?resize=640%2C480" alt="" class="wp-image-3624" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-4.jpeg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-4.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-4.jpeg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Ryders offer some stylish and practical Anti Fog Riding Glasses options that are ideal for bikepacking. They have tapped into a common problem that occurs in sports that you may use eyewear. Things are going to get foggy, well unless you use these glasses. </p>



<p>The back of their lenses have a military-grade, hydrophilic layer. This layer absorbs and disperses water vapour/humidity throughout the material, eliminating the opportunity for it to condense on the surface as fog. </p>



<p>They have even provided a solution for the front side of the lenses to. As so often when you are riding in wet conditions when water gets on the lenses it become hard to see. Ryders treat the front side of the lens independently with a hydrophobic coating. It defends against saturation by shedding water to provide a clear view, free from large drops and water marks. <a href="https://amzn.to/2NABR1E">Priced at $116.99 they are a specific pair of glasses, best suited for bikepacking.</a></p>
