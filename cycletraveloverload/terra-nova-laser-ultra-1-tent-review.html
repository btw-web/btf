<p>This could be the most ultimate tent for your next bike travelling adventure! </p>



<p>Only comes in at a mere 0.56 Kg. This tent has been awarded the Guinness World Record for the lightest double wall shelter in the world, and still features Terra Nova high quality standards!</p>



<p>The fly and base of the tent is made from a cuben fibre, polylaminate material. That on first inspection of the tent appears to be very delicate and looks as though it could rip easy. However, it is extremely durable, windproof and waterproof. As a little bit of history in the sailing and yachting world. It has 600 pound tensile strength, making it extremely tough, you can be rough with it, pull the material and not worry about it tearing easily. </p>



<p>It has me worried that this tents floor is made from cuben fibre as it may puncture and create holes if not cared for. Although cuden is much easier to repair compared to materials like silnylon and it is more puncture resistant to.  </p>



<p>This tent is a one person, with one scandium aluminum pole, that is very strong and lightweight, that runs down and around the middle section of the tent. With smaller carbon fibre pole at the back of the tent.</p>

<p>The tent is a super lightweight design, where this scandium pole runs through a sleeve in the rain fly and the tent itself attaches to the fly from underneath with a series of toggles that connect to elastic bungees on the fly. </p>



<p>The great thing about this tent is that the fly and main tent material stays connected with a clip system at the back, making it easier and quicker to setup and dismantle the tent. All the is required is putting the poles up to setup the tent. </p>



<p>The carbon fibre pole that holds the tent upright at the rear of the tent, breaks apart into two sections making it more user friendly to back this tent. </p>



<p>The midsection of the tent wear the main pole runs around the tent includes a waterproof material that folds over the pole pocket. Also the way Terra Nova built this tent is with waterproof in mind, the stitching points are rolled over on top of each other then sewn, insuring that no water can pass through then seems. </p>

<p>Depending on what you like with a tent, due to its minimalistic design and intended use, this tent does not include any bells or whistles. It is made as a very lightweight tent thats main purpose is to keep you sheltered and dry in bad weather. </p>



<p>It may not suit someone who is very tall, a 5&#8243;9&#8243; person can fit well in this tent no problems. </p>



<p>The door of the tent opens up and when open folds down to the floor of the tent, allows quiet a lot of airflow when opened, and making the tent fell less cramped. </p>



<p>The tent does include a very small vestibule that should allow you to fit some of your gear, if touring it might be a tight fit to get all your panniers in there. But you could defiantly fit most of the little things that you may need to keep dry in rainy conditions. </p>



<p>If you need more ventilation, the tent provides a option to tack up the end of the tents rain fly, with lightweight toggle design. </p>



<p>The tent has multiple guidelines included, that are reflective and have plastic adjustable tension pieces, allowing you to tighten the steak out on the tent. </p>



<p>One of the more unique features of this tent compared to other tents is the 12 titanium stakes. That weigh only 1 gram each. It must be said that they move about and potentially fall out when the tent flats, and are easily lost, if getting this tent you may want to change stakes and get something a little more adequate. </p>



<p>Sold separately is a footprint for this tent, it is essential that you use some kind of groundsheet, if you are using it frequently. </p>



<h3>What is good about this tent</h3>



<ul><li>Extremely lightweight, one of the lightest tents in the world</li><li>Very fast to set-up, expect it to take 2 or 3 minutes if that</li><li>Improved ventilation points on the tent</li><li>Enough room for only one person and most gear</li><li>Gear in the vestibule can be easily access from inside the tent</li><li>The side entry is protected by a vestibule</li><li>Tough in heavy wind and stormy weather</li></ul>



<h3>Things to consider</h3>



<ul><li>Very expensive tent</li><li>No pockets for additional storage</li><li>Worry about the cuben material floor and potential for punctures</li><li>Limited head room, required to be a little hunched over when inside the tent. </li></ul>



<h3>Final Thoughts </h3>



<p>If you do decide to fork out some serious cash for this tent, you will have the pride and bragging rights of owning the lightest one-person single-wall tent in the world. And with this privilege you pay a premium price for it. When you take into consideration the replacement of current steaks and guy-lines to a more functional and realistic option. The overall weight of the tent diminishes.. </p>



<p>It is safe to say the cuben fibre rain fly is guaranteed to last a long time. However, the cuben floor is the main worry. As it is seen that this is the week point that needs to be raised about this tent. It is much more likely to puncture with frequent use. And it might be a better choice for an alternative option that is of less cost. </p>



<p>But, otherwise if you are willing to patch up punctures (easy as it will be with this material) as they happen, so you can have this super light weight tent then all the power to you. </p>



<p>At the end of the day, the decision depends on what your personally prefer in a shelter for your bike travels and what you budget is. As a high-end ultralight tent this is the bees knees. But there is numerous tents out there that are not that much more heavier that are a fraction of the Laser Ultra 1&#8217;s price. </p>



<p>It must be said that Terra Nova tents are made with high quality and lightweight in mind and they do that very well. </p>
