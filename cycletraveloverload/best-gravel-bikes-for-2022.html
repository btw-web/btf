<p>Can you believe it? It&#8217;s almost 2022! Only a few months left in 2021 at the time of writing this post. Bike brands are already giving us a taste of what 2022 has to offer when it comes to gravel bikes. </p>



<p>At the trend has no signs of slowing down. The gravel bike market has filled a nice gap in our cycling community. Allowing you to push drop bar bikes to the limits of adventuring capabilities. Gravel bikes could almost be the perfect bike to do it all. Maybe! Maybe not! Depends on how deep you want to go. </p>



<p>But never the less they are very capable bikes that can allow you to explore off the beaten path and see places you might not have though to venture. At Cycle Travel Overload we are all about exploring by bikes! And we are super excited to be putting this list together of some of the new and updated 2022 gravel bikes. </p>



<p>We have started to see a growing trend in gravel bikes which offer larger tire clearances. Which is a big deal for me personally. Having the ability to run mtb tires on a gravel bike allows you to go further and with some extra road dampening. Also some bikes are coming out with suspension options, for those looking to ride some jaw jarring terrain! </p>



<p>So wanna check out these new 2022 bikes? Okay enough talking let&#8217;s do it! </p>



<h2>2022 Diamondback Haanjo </h2>

<p>The Diamond Haanjo has 8 different bike models on offer. Ranging from $785 to $4,650 USD. Comparing all 2021 to 2022 models there have been no upgrades or changes to the bikes in anyway. They have just been marketed as 2022 for this coming year. There is nothing wrong with that. As this gravel bike is a good entry level rig if you want to get into gravel biking. With more advanced models if you want something more. </p>

<p>It is a rather upright riding bike with a 1.59 stack/reach ratio, the 430 mm chainstay length puts it in the short to mid section for gravel bikes making the rear end fell quick. While the trail is either 66 or 73mm depending if you opt for the Haanjo 6C 650b wheel bike or not. Which is in the higher end making it feel stable up the front. You get clearance for up to 700c x 45mm or 650b x 2.1 inches. </p>



<h2>2022 Megamo West</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="533" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled-design-94-1.png?resize=720%2C533&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7646" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled-design-94-1.png?w=1703&amp;ssl=1 1703w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled-design-94-1.png?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled-design-94-1.png?resize=1024%2C758&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled-design-94-1.png?resize=768%2C568&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled-design-94-1.png?resize=1536%2C1136&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled-design-94-1.png?resize=50%2C37&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Untitled-design-94-1.png?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>An interesting new gravel bike that hit the market back in 2021. With new models for 2022 with upgraded colours. Completely new to me personally. The Megamo West from Spain is a gravel bike that suits those looking to discover new terrain. Explore new trails and go on bikepacking adventures. Built to support; 650bx47, 700cx37 up to 700cx50 wheel sizes. A full carbon gravel bike build featuring seamless looking internal routing for that sleek aesthetic. </p>



<p>Again everything stays pretty much the same for 2022 but different colour options and the slight change in components with some models like the AXS 03. The bike has a 1.50 stack/reach ratio putting it in the average range on the upright/aggressive scale. While the rear sees a 435 mm chainstay fitting nicely into the mid &amp; all-rounder category and rather chill ride feel in the back. Making the bike in theory to be a well balance rig! </p>



<h2>2022 BMC URS</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="424" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BMC-URS-Al-One-gravel-bike-2022-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C424&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7644" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BMC-URS-Al-One-gravel-bike-2022-1.jpeg?w=1569&amp;ssl=1 1569w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BMC-URS-Al-One-gravel-bike-2022-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BMC-URS-Al-One-gravel-bike-2022-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C603&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BMC-URS-Al-One-gravel-bike-2022-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C452&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BMC-URS-Al-One-gravel-bike-2022-1.jpeg?resize=1536%2C905&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BMC-URS-Al-One-gravel-bike-2022-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/BMC-URS-Al-One-gravel-bike-2022-1.jpeg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>BMC URS code name for &#8220;UnReStricted&#8221; is a gravel bike that is set for adventures. Not only that it is a gravel bike that is super lightweight and features a race-ready frame. It is definitely more suited for the gravel racer. With a 1.37 stack/reach ratio putting it in the aggressive seated position. Also the chainstay is short at 425mm adding to its quickness! </p>



<p><strong>Suggested Reading &#8211; <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-flat-bar-gravel-bikes/">Best Flat Bar Gravel Bikes 2022</a></strong></p>



<p>This years models see more options with alloy frames, which means cheaper prices. When comparing updated models from last year. Only differences seems to be colours and the extra model options. Prices for the 2022 bikes range from $2,099 to $10,499. </p>

<p>The Jena is a gravel bike that fits the bill for most styles of gravel riding. Allowing you to ride fast for performance on dirt roads and single track, or adventure, exploration, and bikepacking. A light, reactive, and easy-to-handle bike with racing-comfort geometries. It made the list for our <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ultimate-list-of-the-fastest-gravel-bikes-gravel-race-bikes/">Ultimate List Of The Fastest Gravel Bikes &amp; Gravel Race Bikes</a>. </p>



<p>Again nothing seems to have changed with the 2022 models, except for design and colour options. The Wilier Jena has a <a href="https://wilier.com/en/my2022/int/endurance-bikes/gravel-bikes/jena">plethora of bike options</a> to choose for each budget level. </p>

<p>The new Redwood gravel bike by Poseidon comes in a black which is amazing! Bit of a difference from the adventure green. This bike <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-value-gravel-bikes/">took #1 ranking for the best valued gravel bike in 2021</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Suggested Reading &#8211; <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ultimate-list-of-steel-gravel-bikes/">Ultimate List Of Steel Gravel Bikes</a></strong></p>



<p>With pretty much the same build except for colour options. You get a generous 21.88″ climbing gear which is rather good compared to most gravel bikes. Which will make riding those hills a little easier. Huge tire clearance, the bike comes with 27.5 x 2.35″ tires but the ability to fit up to 2.5&#8243;. It is an alloy build which is what makes it cheaper. But it is made for adventure with tripe fork mounts, rather upright 1.48 stack/reach ratio and the Advent X groupset, weighing in at around 12.5 kg!  </p>



<h2>2022 Devinci Hatchet</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="420" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/46c74-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C420&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7662" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/46c74-1.jpeg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/46c74-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/46c74-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C448&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/46c74-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Devinci Hatchet comes in three different model options, the cheaper bike, Carbon GRX RX600 starts at $4,000. Looks like there is no aluminium options. Only carbon rigs, that merge off-road riding with fast gravel roads and even road riding if you wish. With 700c x 45mm / 650b x 2.1’’ tire clearance.

<p>Specialized have innovated again and made some more changes to their new Diverge line up. With many options to choose from for each budget level. The ultimate all rounder gravel bike. </p>



<p>&#8220;We tossed gravel geometry ‘status-quo’ out the window. The new Diverge has the most progressive geometry we’ve ever created for a drop bar bike, giving riders a capable and stable bike in the dirt, that still feels responsive and nimble on the road. We’ve increased the frame’s reach, introduced a slacker head tube and a longer offset fork. All this creates incredible confidence with a planted feeling in the dirt, while spec’ing shorter stems keeps the overall cockpit length the same and the steering lively. We’ve kept the bike’s BB low to increase stability, but high enough to utilize with 650b wheels if that’s your jam.&#8221;</p>



<p>The new Diverge has space for up to  47mm tires with a 700c wheel and 2.1” with a 650b wheel. </p>

<p>The new Kona Sutra LTD takes on the DNA of the 2021 ULTD which was an upgrade or &#8220;unlimited&#8221; option compared to the 2021 LTD. They are different bikes when it comes to geometry. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/kona-rove-vs-kona-sutra-2021-models-compared/">Check out this comparison</a> of the 2021 Kona Rove vs LTD. Which compares the ULTD and LTD. </p>



<p>So Kona have gotten rid of the ULT title and now the 2022 LTD is their ultimate adventure rig! Comparing the specs of the 2022 LTD to the 2021 ULTD everything geometry wise is identical. The only difference I could find was slightly bigger disk rotors on the 2022 model. Using the SRAM Centerline 180mm compared to 160mm. Also they got rid of the guard around the front crank which adds to its cool points. </p>

<p>The all new Trek Checkpoint has been completely redesigned. Comparing 2021 and 2022 models and there is quite a few to choose from. The first obvious difference is the frame. With the main goal to create a dampened ride for those off the beaten path adventures. The <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/au/en_AU/inside_trek/isospeed/">IsoSpeed decoupler</a>, is responsible for a controlled rebound that soaks up fatiguing bumps without bouncing you around. </p>



<p>The all-new progressive geometry is quick and nimble yet keeps you stable and in control on fast, choppy descents. How is it different? Comparing 54cm frame sized bikes for 2021 and 2022 we can see that the stack/reach ratio is now 1.48 compared to the 1.42, making it much more upright for long bikepacking adventures. The chainstay length is also 10mm longer, wheelbase is 27mm longer overall. The trail is now 70 compared to 64 for the 2021 models. It is overall now a more stable and well-balanced bike for gravel bike adventures. </p>



<p>Also the bike now has a sleek internal storage compartment that gives you a versatile spot to stow tools and gear. Along with integrated frame bag mounts and rack and mudguard mounts. With the same tire clearance for up to 45c and similar bike weight. </p>



<p>Prices starting from $2,399 USD for the alloy model. </p>

<p>Featuring a completely new gravel design with gravel specific geometry. The New Orbea Terra takes all the experiences gathered from both Road and MTB, to deliver a balanced ride, with precise handling and maximum control. </p>



<p>Comfort is a major factor with the new Terra. The angles and dimensions are considered carefully across a range of sizes to maximize rider comfort. Careful tuning of frame rigidity allows Terra to adapt to rough surface. A shorter seat tube, with a slightly more relaxed angle, allows the 27,2mm seat post to flex more. </p>



<p>Riding super fast sections and trails needs to be easy. And that is why the geometry has been improved. With a 430 mm chainstay, 1043 mm wheelbase, 69 trail and 1.49 stack/reach ratio. </p>



<p>It also features a storage area inside the downtube. Along with many mounting options. </p>

<p>A bike with modern MTB inspired geometry, long top and head tubes and short stem to offer nimble, confidence-inspiring handling. Priding itself on comfort and off-road capabilities. </p>

<p>If you are looking for an adventure/bikepacking gravel bike this is worth consideration. With decent tire clearance for up to 700c x 42 mm or 650B x 50 mm. If you want to explore beyond the normal. I would recommend checking out the more rugged &#8220;SILEX+&#8221; version, which can easily tackle more demanding terrain. </p>

<p>Looking for that bike to satisfy all your backcountry desires? From&nbsp;bikepacking and gravel grinders to everyday adventure rides and group trekking. The Devote has you covered. </p>



<p>If you want to check out other <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/12-best-womens-gravel-bikes/">women&#8217;s gravel bike options</a>, all these bikes are worth checking out. </p>



<p>However the Devote is a favourite! Narrower bars and a shorter reach is why this bike is such a great option for most women looking to get into gravel grinding. Also it also holds up great to the abuse you can expect to give it when riding the rougher stuff. You get clearance for 700 x 45 mm and 650 x 50 mm tires. </p>



<p>For a small frame you are looking at a 376 reach compared to say a 381 reach for the same sized frame Giant Revolt. Also the Devote has a 1.48 stack/reach ratio which means rather average compared to most other gravel bikes. $30 mm chainstay length, 75.9 trail and 1020 wheelbase. </p>
