<p>One of the most popular bikepacking destinations in the world is Chile, and I’ve become obsessed with it! I’ve spent hours looking up routes, travel blogs, insane photography and bikepacking tips. So, I thought it was about time to write down my findings and share them with you. Being from Australia makes going to South America quite a big investment so it’s not somewhere I have previously indulged. I’ve heard of many people bikepacking there but never realised how incredible it actually is!</p>



<p>It offers complete wild camping freedom and isolation like nowhere else. Whether you’re riding over mountain passes through the outdoor lovers&#8217; nirvana of Patagonia, or whether you’re getting the miles in through the Atacama desert, Chile has it all. People who have ridden there cannot explain the natural beauty they have seen. They comment on how friendly the people are and how good the gravel roads are. </p>



<p>Let me share my research with you and we can explore this wonderful land together, digitally (for now). This article is going to look at the top 5 bikepacking and touring routes through Chile that I have found and cannot wait to explore myself! Hopefully this is a good bit of travel inspiration for when we can all go adventuring the world again.</p>



<h2>Top 5 bikepacking routes in Chile</h2>



<ol><li><strong>Lakes District </strong></li><li><strong>Careterra Austral (Patagonia)</strong></li><li><strong>Terres del Fuego (Patagonia)</strong></li><li><strong>Pasos de Agua Negra</strong></li><li><strong>Monkey Puzzle Trail</strong></li></ol>



<h2>Lakes District</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="404" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chile-lake-district-activities-1505979583-785X440.jpg?resize=720%2C404&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6418" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chile-lake-district-activities-1505979583-785X440.jpg?resize=785%2C440&amp;ssl=1 785w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chile-lake-district-activities-1505979583-785X440.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chile-lake-district-activities-1505979583-785X440.jpg?resize=768%2C430&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chile-lake-district-activities-1505979583-785X440.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Probably one of the most serene bikepacking areas in Chile. It is truly breathtaking. Passing huge pristine lakes with snow capped volcano backdrops, rainforests and tiny villages with striking and colourful native architecture. You will feel like you’re in a storybook. There is a route called Huilo Huilo which goes through the Ecological reserve which I want to tell you about. There’s also some pretty amazing looking mountain bike trails here too! </p>



<p>The route is around 203km long and is a fairly easy ride. It passes through some villages so you can refuel fairly easily every couple of days and if you want accommodation it’s there but if you prefer to wild camp you can. It should take around 4 days with a river crossing or two. Going South to North you will start at Lago Ranco and head West. You’ll follow the Rio Pillanleufu up towards Neltume. Then you can head North towards Coña Ripe on Lago Calafquen. </p>



<p>If you’re heading to Chile for a short period of time then the Lakes District is a great choice, or can be combined with a much longer trip from Patagonia!</p>



<h2>Carretera Austral</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="380" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Carretera-austral-sernatur-DST263.jpg?resize=720%2C380&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6419" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Carretera-austral-sernatur-DST263.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Carretera-austral-sernatur-DST263.jpg?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Carretera-austral-sernatur-DST263.jpg?resize=768%2C405&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Carretera-austral-sernatur-DST263.jpg?resize=1024%2C540&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Carretera-austral-sernatur-DST263.jpg?resize=50%2C26&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This is a long epic highway route through the backbone of Chile. Expect 1200km of gravel roads, lakes and high mountains. Despite being an iconic highway many people report minimal traffic so staying in touch with nature is easy. Trip reports say there are beautiful natural camping spots and plenty of water sources. Winner!</p>



<p>At times it can be harsh to ride in but if isolation and gravel roads are what you&#8217;re seeking then this is your place! You’ll meet the Pacific Ocean at times, then climb through Parque Nacional Queulat heading towards the largest town of Coyhaique. This route takes you past the famous and amazing Marble Caves at Lago General Carrera and Chile’s largest river, Rio Baker. Some amazing scenes here, even if you don’t do the whole route.</p>



<h2>Tierra de Fuego &#8211; Patagonia&nbsp;</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="333" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tierra-del-fuego-united-by-adventureweek_595586790344c.jpg?resize=720%2C333&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6420" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tierra-del-fuego-united-by-adventureweek_595586790344c.jpg?w=2400&amp;ssl=1 2400w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tierra-del-fuego-united-by-adventureweek_595586790344c.jpg?resize=300%2C139&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tierra-del-fuego-united-by-adventureweek_595586790344c.jpg?resize=768%2C355&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tierra-del-fuego-united-by-adventureweek_595586790344c.jpg?resize=1024%2C474&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tierra-del-fuego-united-by-adventureweek_595586790344c.jpg?resize=50%2C23&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tierra-del-fuego-united-by-adventureweek_595586790344c.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tierra-del-fuego-united-by-adventureweek_595586790344c.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This literally translates to ‘Lands of fire’. Who doesn’t want to explore that?! This is the archipelago at the southernmost tip of Patagonia and the route is called Fin del Mundo which means ‘end of the world’. It doesn’t get more epic than this! The empty, isolated track here is desert like in parts and has some of the oldest forests in the world in other parts. The route goes between Punto Arenas and Ushuaia and has 5330m of ascent. Make sure to go in November to March so you can access the full route and remember South to North will see you tackling that heavy prevailing headwind, plan ahead!</p>



<p>This route to the end of the world is 628km long and will take around 10 days. There are some long pushes and climbs and the weather can make this very difficult. Equally, if you’re riding North to South you can use the winds to your advantage. I really want to ride here, it looks like nothing else, and it’s the closest to Antarctica you can get! </p>



<h2>Pasos de Agua Negra</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="441" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/este-mic3a9rcoles-se-abre-el-paso-de-agua-negra.jpg?resize=640%2C441&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6421" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/este-mic3a9rcoles-se-abre-el-paso-de-agua-negra.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/este-mic3a9rcoles-se-abre-el-paso-de-agua-negra.jpg?resize=300%2C207&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/este-mic3a9rcoles-se-abre-el-paso-de-agua-negra.jpg?resize=50%2C34&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you’re after altitude then this is the route for you. This is more of a touring route than a bikepacking route but nevertheless it’s epic. This route is about 365km long and has a high point of around 4700m! It’s making me sweat thinking about it. This route takes you from Chile to Argentina and takes you past some insane looking spikes of snow called ‘penitentes’, past idyllic lakes and climbing bumpy gravel roads into Argentina. There are some pretty desolate looking gravel roads and on this route so be prepared, probably need to stock up supplies for 6 or so days at some points. There is a river close by for a lot of it which is good for water resupplying. What most people say to watch out for is the effects of the altitude, cycling becomes very difficult this high up and your mileage will drop significantly. You should spend a day or so acclimatising rather than aiming straight for the summit. Then comes the downhill, what we all dream of. Apparently, the headwind and poor road surface can be a killer here and can take longer than you think.</p>



<h2>Monkey Puzzle Trail</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="720" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC5375-scaled.jpg?resize=720%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6422" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC5375-scaled.jpg?w=1290&amp;ssl=1 1290w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC5375-scaled.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC5375-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC5375-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC5375-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DSC5375-scaled.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Named after the trees there, this trail offers a variety of riding, some dirty bumpy single track for those who want it or smoother gravel and road riding for those that don’t. Following rivers, hot springs and forests from Melipeuco to Ralco. It passes through the towns of Lonquimay and Chequenco along the way. There are different route options through the national parks and wild camping or accommodation options depending on your preference. Compared to the other routes I’ve outlined this one seems to have a lot more greenery, more off-road and a lot less altitude. Sounds right up my street! It covers about 230km and should take around 4 days, so it’s completely doable and enjoyable. Probably a good intro ride to South America!</p>



<p>So there we have it, my top 5 bikepacking and touring routes through Chile. I can’t stop looking through blogs and pictures of the place I can’t wait to go!</p>
