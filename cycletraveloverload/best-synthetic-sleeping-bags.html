<p>If you are like me and like to purchase ethically produced products. For example not down for sleeping bags and want to buy something that didn&#8217;t cause the harm or death of animals to make. Then you will appreciate this list of synthetic sleeping bags. </p>



<p>But first it must be mentioned that not all sleeping bags are considered equal. Unlike down, synthetic sleeping bags are said to not preform as well in colder weather as down seems to be the best for warm. Down is expensive and this might be why you want to opt for synthetic, for the cheaper prices. But down does have a better warmth-to-weight ratio and compresses more for a smaller packed size. But there are synthetic options out there that can keep you warm in temperatures even below zero. </p>



<p>It was very hard to find really any synthetic sleeping bags that ticked all the boxes. Here at Cycle Travel Overload we are about exploring by bike. And this requires that most of our gear be lightweight or ultralight. While ideally the sleeping bag being able to produce warm in the coldest of nights. </p>



<p>Along with lightweight and performance the sleeping bag ideally needs to pack rather smaller in volume, to not take up that much space in bikepacking bags or panniers. Yes if you are bike touring and you have a large 4 x panniers setup plus room to mount a sleeping bag on top of your rear rack then you can get away with a larger volume sleeping bag when packed. But if you are like me and bikepack then you know ever 1L of volume needs to be optimised.</p>



<p>So ideally when I am looking for a sleeping bag, anything under 1 kg in weight is acceptable but really I want something lighter if I can get under 500 grams and a great temperature rating, like 2 degrees and under then that seems rather good. And of course with a small packing volume. But honestly this is hard to come by with synthetic sleeping bags.</p>



<h2>Wiggy&#8217;s 35º Sleeping Bag</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="513" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/35Deg-SpecialBag__22809.1512150437.1280.1280-1.jpg?resize=720%2C513&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5604" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/35Deg-SpecialBag__22809.1512150437.1280.1280-1.jpg?w=1175&amp;ssl=1 1175w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/35Deg-SpecialBag__22809.1512150437.1280.1280-1.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/35Deg-SpecialBag__22809.1512150437.1280.1280-1.jpg?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/35Deg-SpecialBag__22809.1512150437.1280.1280-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C730&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/35Deg-SpecialBag__22809.1512150437.1280.1280-1.jpg?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Weight is one of the main factors for me when it comes to sleeping bags. And Wiggy&#8217;s are renowned for producing synthetic only sleeping bags. This bag is their lightest weight with a decent temperature rating. This bag weighs in at 2.5 pounds or 1.13 kg. Yes it is on the heavy side for sure when it comes to bikepacking. But still worth it in my opinion. You get a temperature rating of +35º F or +1.67°C which is like I said decent. At least here in Australia it would do the job as it gets down to about 5 to 10 degrees at night. Combined that with thermals and it should be okay. </p>



<p>Wiggy&#8217;s sleeping bags feature a Lamilite filling which uses a continuous filament fiber called Climashield. Climashield is comprised of thousands of continuous strands of synthetic fibers in a unique interlocking solution. By carefully combining specially designed continuous fibers. Climashield products are manufactured with superior thermal efficiency and durability performance to alternative insulations. The sleeping bags use the radiation heat out bodies produce to trap it in the bag and keep you warm. <a href="https://www.wiggys.com/specials/35-sleeping-bag/">Prices for the sleeping bag start at $130.00</a></p>



<h2>NEMO&nbsp;Forte 20 Sleeping Bag</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="515" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/aef1a652-503a-4824-83c1-53337f9f9fd1.jpeg?resize=720%2C515&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5605" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/aef1a652-503a-4824-83c1-53337f9f9fd1.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/aef1a652-503a-4824-83c1-53337f9f9fd1.jpeg?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/aef1a652-503a-4824-83c1-53337f9f9fd1.jpeg?resize=768%2C550&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/aef1a652-503a-4824-83c1-53337f9f9fd1.jpeg?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>It is a real stretch to find any synthetic sleeping bags that compare to Down quality. Even with great brands like Nemo who are known for their lightweight gear. It is difficult to find a bag under 1 kg with below zero capabilities. But if you are after a below zero bag (in Celsius) this Nemo Forte 20 bags offers a temperature rating down to 20 degrees (F) or -7 degrees (C) with a weight from 2 lbs. 14 oz or 1.3 kg for the regular option. </p>



<p>The bag is targeted to those side sleepers. I should raise my hand, that&#8217;s me too. A classic mummy design that adds room at the elbows and knees for 3-season, side sleeping comfort. Yes all synthetic is is made from 80% postconsumer recycled content, PrimaLoft RISE insulation which delivers maximum warmth with less weight and water retention than conventional synthetic insulation. (They also have a <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F163034%2Fnemo-forte-20-sleeping-bag-womens">womens model here</a>) Which is slightly heavier. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F162948%2Fnemo-forte-20-sleeping-bag-mens">Prices start from $199.95</a></p>

<h2>Marmot Trestles 0 Sleeping Bag</h2>

<p>If you are after a super warm synthetic sleeping bag, there comes more weight. The Durable SpiraFil insulation provides an exceptional combination of warmth, softness, low weight and packability.
