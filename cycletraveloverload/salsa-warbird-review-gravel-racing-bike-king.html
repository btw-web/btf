<p>The Salsa Warbird was the first ever gravel racing bike. Launching back in 2012, back then it was more then a cyclocross bike but still lacking the gravel bike features that it is so famous for today. Since the beginning it has gone through many different styles and variations. The Salsa Warbird is available in two current 2020 models online. The option is yours between the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F167219%2Fsalsa-warbird-carbon-apex-1-bike">Salsa&nbsp;Warbird Carbon Apex 1</a> and the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F167218%2Fsalsa-warbird-carbon-grx-600-bike">Salsa&nbsp;Warbird Carbon GRX 600</a>. To be honest I personally love the SHRAM 1&#215;11 setups and it would be a no brainer for me to get the Apex 1 plus it is $600 cheaper!</p>

<p>The Warbird is based around a high-modulus carbon fiber frameset. The bike is designed for racing on gravel, Warbird provides control, comfort and speed when the going gets rough. If you are looking for a touch cyclocross racing bike or something to tackle events like the Dirty Kanza 200 this is a go to option. </p>

<p>If however you are just looking for a bike that would work well for various types of bikepacking adventures, this would be more then capable. You get many eyelets for mounting gear on the bike, (top tube and fork braise-ons). Do remember that this bike is all carbon fibre bike. The fork is a Waxwing Carbon.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/fc934c73-3818-4a00-a8e3-63b0794aee2a.jpeg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4666" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/fc934c73-3818-4a00-a8e3-63b0794aee2a.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/fc934c73-3818-4a00-a8e3-63b0794aee2a.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/fc934c73-3818-4a00-a8e3-63b0794aee2a.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/fc934c73-3818-4a00-a8e3-63b0794aee2a.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>One of the main features that is amazing about this bike is the Vibration Reduction System or VRS. Which is said to &#8220;tame tough terrain!&#8221; This feature has two main functions on the bike. With a tall, thin, vertically oriented seat-stay that subtly flex outward on impacts, promoting vertical compliance. While also horizontally-oriented chainstays with Class 5 VRS resist pedaling torque to maintain a laterally stiff rear end with the efficiency and comfort endurance riders need. Overall the VRS works with the gravel racing geometry to deliver a comfortable, responsive and confident ride. </p>



<h4><strong>Salsa Warbird Weight and Other Specs (Apex 1 Vs GRX 600 Specs Compared)</strong></h4>

<p>The all Carbon frameset Warbird comes in at around a total weight of 20.31 pounds or 9.2 kg. I was looking online and had trouble finding the frameset weight. Although I did find that Salsa did make around 100 grams of frame improvements when it comes to the new models of the Warbird. But a sub 10kg bike is definitely a good selling point, especially for gravel racing. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="411" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/8318cba2-3b11-4b34-9dab-767bfb0b8997.jpeg?resize=720%2C411&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4663" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/8318cba2-3b11-4b34-9dab-767bfb0b8997.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/8318cba2-3b11-4b34-9dab-767bfb0b8997.jpeg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/8318cba2-3b11-4b34-9dab-767bfb0b8997.jpeg?resize=768%2C439&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/8318cba2-3b11-4b34-9dab-767bfb0b8997.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>GRX 600</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The main two differences with the two models mentioned above is the gravel gearing. Yes they are both really great, but the GRX 600 has a Shimano RX600-11, 46/30t crankset with a Shimano RX810 Rear Derailleur. With the Apex 1 you get, you guessed it a SRAM Apex 1 X-Sync, 42t crank with SRAM Apex 1 Rear Derailleur. Obviously if you are not familiar already the GRX 600 comes with 2 × 11 drivetrain option which gives you better climbing gears and more variety.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="407" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/586ca472-cd22-41e2-aa08-1b28f7588069.jpeg?resize=720%2C407" alt="" class="wp-image-4667" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/586ca472-cd22-41e2-aa08-1b28f7588069.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/586ca472-cd22-41e2-aa08-1b28f7588069.jpeg?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/586ca472-cd22-41e2-aa08-1b28f7588069.jpeg?resize=768%2C434&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/586ca472-cd22-41e2-aa08-1b28f7588069.jpeg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>APEX 1</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The bottom bracket on both bikes is still the same with the BB86 PressFit. When it comes to brakes you get TRP Spyre-C Flat Mount, 160 mm rotors Mechanical disc brakes on the Apex 1. While the GRX 600 has Shimano RX400, Hydraulic disc brakes with the RT66 160 mm rotors. All the other specs are rather similar. The only other difference is the rims which are WTB Serra for the Apex and WTB Speedterra with the GRX 600. And obviously different shifters. </p>



<h2>Great Things About The Salsa Warbird</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/0aec13b3-7cce-4695-a717-e2745c3a5aef.jpeg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4668" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/0aec13b3-7cce-4695-a717-e2745c3a5aef.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/0aec13b3-7cce-4695-a717-e2745c3a5aef.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/0aec13b3-7cce-4695-a717-e2745c3a5aef.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/0aec13b3-7cce-4695-a717-e2745c3a5aef.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>The Warbird has one the best cargo capacity of most gravel bikes on the market. Giving you up to 4 different mounting options for water bottle cages on the frame. This is for sizes 56cm and up. </li><li>If you are getting this bike specifically for gravel racing then the geometry is more slacker and better suited for this. Giving you more stability over sketchy sections. </li><li>The new 2020 models come with upgraded colors then the previous years models. And the better 2020 Warbird models come with the Shimano GRX gravel component group set. </li><li>You also get three mounts on each fork leg allowing you to carry all the water, supplies, and extra gear you need for a full day (or days) on the dirt.</li><li>If Dropper Posts are your thing, you the Warbird has you covered. It is dropper post compatible with 1x or Di2 set ups. </li><li>You also get internally sleeved cable routing which helps keep your cables clean and prevents rattling for a quiet ride, so you can enjoy the solitude of the open dirt roads.</li><li>The new 2020 models have some rather cool gravel riding upgrades including the ergonomically designed brake levers. These make it easy to maneuver the bike over rough roads and wet conditions.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Salsa Warbird Geometry and Sizing</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1bb27d64-1f3e-4ed4-a268-11190b14a963.jpeg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4669" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1bb27d64-1f3e-4ed4-a268-11190b14a963.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1bb27d64-1f3e-4ed4-a268-11190b14a963.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1bb27d64-1f3e-4ed4-a268-11190b14a963.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1bb27d64-1f3e-4ed4-a268-11190b14a963.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The geometry of the Warbird is more towards the gravel racing side which places you in a position that can be maintained for hours on end over bumpy B-roads and loose surfaces, reducing fatigue. </p>



<p>But lets talk numbers. For example we are going to take the Salsa&nbsp;Warbird Carbon Apex 1 model in the 56 cm model, it has a 70.8° head tube angle, 73° seat tube angle, a 70mm bottom bracket drop, 430mm chainstays, and 585 mm of stack and a 381 mmm reach. With a wheelbase of 1,038 mm.</p>



<p>The low bottom bracket and stable wheelbase help keep tires planted and boost confidence; Long top tube and short stem increase stability at high speeds and on rough descents. </p>

<p>When having a look at the bikes overall angles it seems as though it is more suited to gravel racing as the bike is intended to be used mostly for. But again there is not stopping you from using it on normal bikepacking overnight adventures. </p>



<p>The Warbird is available in seven different frame sizes:&nbsp;49,&nbsp;52.5,&nbsp;54.5,&nbsp;56,&nbsp;57.5, 59, 61. So you do get the option for all you really tall humans out there to get a racing gravel bike that will fit! </p>

<p>When gravel roads beckon, the Salsa Warbird Carbon GRX 600 bike is the answer. With a gravel-specific drivetrain and responsive, comfortable carbon frameset, it&#8217;s ready to go all day—on any terrain.</p>



<h2>Things To Keep In Mind</h2>



<ul><li>Maybe it is just me, but I have the Kona Sutra LTD 2020 and I have 50mm tires this. And since using these sized tires it would be a stretch for me to go back to anything thinner. But it is worth noting that the Warbird is able to have full-fender coverage for up to 700c x 38mm or 650b x 47mm tires. Which is still rather good but not the best for similar bikes.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Bike Owners Thoughts on the Salsa Warbird</strong></h4>



<p>Most bike testers for the Salsa Warbird have mentioned that this bike is &#8220;so lively and quick.&#8221; Even when the bike was tested with a number of water bottles and bike bags it is &#8220;yet so comfy and surefooted.&#8221; You know it is built to crush gravel even when the rough stuff is so easy peasy!</p>



<p>&#8220;On a regular ride I do on a MTB, it&#8217;s 2mph quicker on average. Very comfortable. Very stable and predictable. Rolls well and feels very planted and predictable. I absolutely love it.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Salsa have done great work in being able to connect the dots between road oriented snappiness and endurance stability for long days in the saddle. Back in 2012 they mastered a solution to the cyclocross bikes not being the best suited for extended distance events and with this Warbird the problem was solved. to this day the Warbird stands as the top dog when it comes to gravel bike racing. </p>



<p>Even though the Salsa Warbird is high gravel racing pedigree it is still a great bike to take out on bikepacking outings. With more then enough storage options for all your gear. Including top tube bag bosses, low rider rack mounts, mounts inside the triangle, below the down tube, and along the fork legs, as well as fender mounts. What more could you ask for in a gravel grinding machine? </p>
