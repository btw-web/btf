<p>If you are in the market for a new touring bike. You can pick up something nice for around the $2,000 mark. In this article we offer you the ultimate list of touring bikes under this budget.</p>



<p>All bikes are touring bikes at heart. And recommended for taking on a adventure. Some maybe be more suited for lighter tours and other across the world expeditions. </p>



<p>Depending on what type of touring adventure you have in mind, the bikes in this list offer it all. </p>



<p>When we put this list together. We wanted to just stick to touring bikes strictly. So this means opting out any gravel bikes and bikes more suited to bikepacking. </p>



<p>So just quickly what is a touring bike? For the purpose of selection for this list of bikes. A touring bike is one that is more suited for road cycling with some off-road from time to time. Build tough, generally from steel, although some bikes are still good when made from other materials. As the more modern materials are improved from years passed. So you can expect aluminum and carbon options. Also touring, for me, means that you will be using a pannier setup. Which means you need a bike with long enough chainstay and wheelbase. While also providing all the mounting braze ons for racks. Geometry on a touring bike is designed to offer more relaxed positioning for long days in the saddle. </p>



<p><strong>So what are the best touring bikes under $2,000?</strong> Here is the list of them for your reference. Learn more about each bike further on. There is a range of expedition, light touring and off-road touring bikes. For all kinds of touring. All bikes are either 2021 or 2020 models, so you know you are looking at the newest in touring bike technology and design. </p>

<p>The Sutra is a personal favourite of mine. The Sutra LTD is my personal bike of choice. The reason I got the lTD is it can be used for bikepacking and touring. As the chainstay lengths are the same on this touring sutra. However if you are just after a dedicated touring bike this boasts more than enough to get the job done. With the Dero 3 × 10 drivetrain providing a wide range of gears. With Mechanical Disc Brakes, Steel build, Brooks B17 Leather saddle, Schwalbe Marathon Mondial 700x40c, racks and fenders. All priced at $1,499</p>

<p>The ll new 2021 Trek 520 is a steel frame touring bike with mid-range components and mechanical disc brakes. Those mid-range components include; a Alivio, Sora 3 x 9 groupset. However it is not a full steel bike, like the Sutra. With a aluminum fork. Total weight&nbsp;of the bike is 31.4 lbs / 14.2 kg. It comes with Bontrager H1 Hard-case Ultimate, 700x38c&nbsp;tires and racks. Price for this bike is $1,679. </p>



<h2>2020 Co-op ADV 3.2</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="455" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/f5398d2c-7018-48e2-a742-138751f740f6.jpeg?resize=720%2C455&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6266" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/f5398d2c-7018-48e2-a742-138751f740f6.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/f5398d2c-7018-48e2-a742-138751f740f6.jpeg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/f5398d2c-7018-48e2-a742-138751f740f6.jpeg?resize=768%2C485&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/f5398d2c-7018-48e2-a742-138751f740f6.jpeg?resize=50%2C32&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>With this bike you get a aluminum frame touring bike with high-end components and hydraulic disc brakes. Aluminum for me personally is not desirable. Steel is real! But still for the price ad the higher quality components this is a good buy. The groupset is a 2 x 10 Shimano Deore XT. Rolling on some Donnelly X&#8217;Plor MSO, 650b x 50 tires. And weighs 25.5 lbs / 11.6 kg. Priced for this bike is only $1,078. </p>



<h2>2020 Polygon BEND R5</h2>

<p>The Polygon Bend R5 is a aluminum frame touring bike with high-end components and hydraulic disc brakes. Featuring a carbon fork for that extra suppleness. The groupset is a 1 x 11 GRX 800. This is more suited for gravel grinding. But if you are looking for a light touring / gravel bike. This is one worth considering. It comes with WTB VENTURE 650X47C tires and even a dropper post. While also featuring front and rear racks. Priced at $1,299</p>



<h2>Surly Bridge Club</h2>

<p>Not your traditional road touring bike. But a completely capable off-road touring bike, that is a steel frame touring bike with upper mid-range components and hydraulic disc brakes. I have met a few tourers who use this bike for touring and bikepacking rides. Very versatile with the SX Eagle groupset and options for 26″ / 650b / 700c wheels. The bike comes stock with some nice and wide WTB Riddler 27.5&#215;2.4&#8243; tires. Making it awesome for some rough touring conditions pretty much anywhere. It is a flat bar bike, but you could easily swap them out for some <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/trekking-bars-butterfly-handlebars-review-my-experience-after-5000-km/">butterfly bars</a>. Priced at $1,200</p>



<h2>Surly ECR</h2>

<p>Another steel touring bike from Surly, which again is more suited for off-road adventures. This bike has better high-end components with a 1 x 12 NX Eagle, but mechanical disc brakes. But one of the bigger selling points for this bike is it comes stock with the Surly Moloko bars. Which offer many comfortable riding positions, which is perfect for long tours. The bikes rolls on some nice and supple Surly Knard 27.5&#215;3.0&#8243; tires. Priced at $1,900</p>



<h2>Ribble Adventure 725, SRAM NX</h2>
