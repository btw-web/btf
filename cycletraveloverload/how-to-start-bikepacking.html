<p>In theory, anyone with a bike and a rucksack can start bikepacking. Bikepacking is about getting out into the great outdoors, away from the hustle and bustle and discovering new places. Bikepacking by definition is any multi-day cycling adventure, usually off road, that involves camping. It’s about being self-sufficient on two wheels and setting up camp when your little legs can’t cycle any longer. Some adventures may be shorter and see you through towns to pick up food along the way, and others might be longer and more wild meaning you have to carry all your food, water and a stove with you. Whatever your journey entails this article will help you get started.</p>



<h3><strong>First bikepacking trip</strong></h3>



<p>This is so exciting! Be prepared for things to go wrong, to get lost and to get pretty wet and muddy! This is all part of the adventure. We suggest starting local and going for a single night or weekend trip. This allows you to learn what you NEED to pack, and how you and your bike FEEL while you’re riding. You can better judge your achievable mileage for longer trips if you start here. If anything does go wrong then you should be able to get to safety or help easily.</p>



<h3><strong>Make sure everything works</strong></h3>



<p>First things first, make sure your bike and helmet are in good working order. Get it in for a service, and make sure you’ve got spares and the mechanical kit you need. No point getting all the gear and setting off to find out everything goes wrong 20km in!</p>



<h3><strong>Plan to your route according to your bike and ability</strong></h3>



<p>Think about the bike you’ve already got. If you’ve got a road bike then you’ll need to plan a route on more sealed and country roads. Get your OS map out and look for bridleways or footpaths. If you own a mountain bike then you can look at more off-road trails. To really get you excited why not buy a bikepacking book for well established, easy routes near you. Bikepacking is not about how fast and direct you can get somewhere. It’s about adventure, discovery and being outdoors. </p>



<p>You will be carrying more load than you’re used to, so you won’t be going as fast. You might be navigating single track trails that you’re not used to, and might get lost. Take this into account when planning your route. If you’re wild camping then this matters less but if you’re planning on booking campsites then you need to ensure they aren’t too far apart (or not far enough!). Get your map out and have a few camping options. Generally, arriving late and leaving early whilst ‘leaving no trace’ is the done thing when wild camping. Some countries are more strict than others and some countries may have animals you need to be wary of, so read up before you go. If you are booking a campsite, we recommend having a shorter ride than a longer one, in case the weather turns, it gets dark or something goes wrong. You can always ride further next time.</p>



<h3><strong>What gear do I need for bikepacking</strong></h3>



<h2>Bags</h2>



<p>Like we said at the start, technically you can go with just you and a rucksack! You just don’t want that rucksack to be so heavy it gives you back pain. We recommend getting at least a saddle bag in addition to your rucksack as these hold the most and are well positioned for the load.</p>



<p>Next up are handlebar bags and tube bags. You can easily strap a dry bag you already own to your handlebars with ski straps or similar if you don’t want to invest much initially.</p>



<h2>Sleeping</h2>



<p>Next you will need somewhere to sleep. This can be a small tent or bivvy bag. Which one you get will depend on your trip style. If you’re likely to get wet and face the elements for a few days in a row you will want a small tent and packable air mattress. If you’re only away for the night in milder climates than a small bivvy bag or swag will do.</p>



<h2>Food and water</h2>



<p>Next comes food and water. If you’re only away for a night and will be cycling through towns then you could save on weight and buy your food as your go. If you’re heading out into the wilderness you’ll need to pack it all up with you. If you’re doing it properly and are away in the wilderness for a few days you’ll need a little camping stove too! </p>



<p>Think about packing long range fuel foods like dried fruit and nuts, oat bars and complex carbs. If you’re cooking on your stove things like porridge sachets with dried fruit, couscous or pasta with tinned fish and dehydrated food sachets are all good options. Foods that don’t mind getting squished are always a bonus!</p>



<p>Your rucksack should ideally be one that can take a camelbak water container or you can mount water bottles on your frame. If you’re going somewhere where finding water is going to be difficult then always over pack, cycling with the added weight is going to be more difficult than usual cycling so you’ll need more water. We always take water purification tablets just in case.</p>



<p>So you’ve got a rigged up bike, a route, a tent and some fuel. Now all you need is to get out there and give it a go! Every trip will be different and you will grow and learn every time, we are so excited for you! We always like taking a friend to share the epic adventures with, but equally, a bit of solace and ‘me time’ might be just what the Doctor ordered.</p>
