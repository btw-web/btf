<p>The idea of getting outside and exploring by bike, seems more and more appealing these days. As lockdown and covid has changed the way we perceive how life was before. </p>



<p>Getting out and exploring by bicycle seems much more popular but for a good reason. There is nothing quite like packing all the gear you need to thrive on a bike and riding off to an unknown location. </p>



<p>If you currently have a bike, it is most likely good enough to go bikepacking. Well at least to get started and familiar with bikepacking. However bikepacking bikes are a special breed. And offer much more options than a standard bike. </p>



<p>Offering better on bike comfort for those long days in the saddle, thanks to an upright, comfortable and progressive geometry. Long wheelbase, longer chain-stay and appropriate trail lengths, making the bike more manageable when cornering with a load. Along with large tire clearances for tires that can just about roll over all types of terrains. Many mounting options and braze-on eyelets for bags, racks and other cargo cages. </p>



<p>Below is our favourite bikepacking bikes of 2021. included are gravel bikes, hardtail MTB, full suspension and even fat bike options. To give you the perfect bikepacking bike for all type of bike adventures. </p>



<h2>Kona Unit X</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="378" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C378&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7165" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C538&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C403&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?resize=1536%2C806&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C26&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>A practical and well-priced cromoly bike, the Kona Unit is a favourite. Thanks to it being a bikepacking monster thanks to tire clearance for up to 2.8&#8243;, that SRAM SX Eagle 12-speed drivetrain. Offering a 19&#8243; climbing gear and a 86&#8243; highest gear. You also get the option to run single speed, with the modular dropouts. Or it even has the potential to run an internally geared hub. </p>



<p>The bike does lack with a rather narrow 760mm handlebar, no dropper post, and some have complaints with the Eagle SX derailleur when running smaller cranks. </p>



<p>I have been playing with the idea to get this bike and swap out the rigid fork for a suspension and turning this capable bikepacking machine into a hardtail. The frame is designed for a fork with 100mm of travel. With also changing out for some <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-swept-back-handlebars-ultimate-list-of-22-mtb-bars/">sweptback mtb bars</a>. This bike would be so cool with some Moonrise bmx style bars. </p>



<p>The Unit has all you could need to be the perfect bikepacking dirt adventure bike. With stability, comfort, speed and versatility. And for the price it is hard to beat. </p>



<h2>Breezer Thunder</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-thunder_1-2000x1333-2.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7173" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-thunder_1-2000x1333-2.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-thunder_1-2000x1333-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-thunder_1-2000x1333-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-thunder_1-2000x1333-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-thunder_1-2000x1333-2.jpeg?resize=1536%2C863&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-thunder_1-2000x1333-2.jpeg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/breezer-thunder_1-2000x1333-2.jpeg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Breezer Thunder is a well priced fully rigid bikepacking mountain bike. Coming in at a similar price to the Kona Unit X. But the Thunder comes with a dropper post and clearance for tires up to 29 x 2.95&#8243;. The Thunder features WTB Vigilante 29 x 2.5&#8243; tires, and is powered by a 1&#215;12 Shimano Deore drivetrain and Shimano MT500 hydraulic disc brakes. The 34T up front and 10-51T cassette, offers a 19.76&#8243; climbing gear and a 100.26&#8243; highest gear. </p>



<p>The Thunder is bikepacking ready with mounting options galore, including rack and fenders, bottle mounts, triple pack mounts on the fork legs, plus the seat stay mounts. Then additional bosses on the top tube and under the downtube.</p>



<h2>Kona Sutra ULTD</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="437" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kona-Sutra-ULTD_0-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C437&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7175" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kona-Sutra-ULTD_0-1.jpeg?w=2334&amp;ssl=1 2334w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kona-Sutra-ULTD_0-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kona-Sutra-ULTD_0-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C621&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kona-Sutra-ULTD_0-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C466&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kona-Sutra-ULTD_0-1.jpeg?resize=1536%2C932&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kona-Sutra-ULTD_0-1.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1242&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kona-Sutra-ULTD_0-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kona-Sutra-ULTD_0-1.jpeg?w=1440 1440w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kona-Sutra-ULTD_0-1.jpeg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The all new 2021 Kona Sutra ULTD, meaning &#8220;unlimited&#8221; is an upgrade from 2020&#8217;s &#8220;limited or LTD&#8221; model. See the main differences here. However the gearing is still limited like the LTD. It features the SRAM NX, 36t X-Sync crank and SRAM PG1130 11-42t cassette. The bike gets a 24.93″ climbing gear and 94.79″ highest gear. </p>



<p>I personally rate the Kona Sutra, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/kona-sutra-ltd-review-bikepacking-bike/">read the review here</a> of the 2020 LTD model. It had its downfalls with a limited climbing gear. I have added 2.3&#8243; MTB tires and a 28T crank giving it a nice 19.50&#8243; climbing gear. While also upgrading to 50cm dropbars with more degree flare. No need to worry about skinny  gravel tires if you plan to ride mountain trails. The ULTD comes with the Maxxis Recon Race EXO TR 29&#215;2.25&#8243; tires. </p>



<p>The ULTD also includes some changes to the frame with more mounting options for gear. It is a really upright dropbar adventure bike with a 1.57 stack/reach ratio. </p>

<p>If you are on a budget and looking for a very capable bikepacking bike, this Poseidon Redwood is worth the look. It made it in the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-gravel-bikes-under-1000-for-2021-budget-gravel-bikes/">best gravel bikes under $1000 article</a> we posted here on Cycle Travel Overload.

<h2>Surly Karate Monkey</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-surly-karate-monkey_5-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7181" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-surly-karate-monkey_5-1.jpeg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-surly-karate-monkey_5-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-surly-karate-monkey_5-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-surly-karate-monkey_5-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-surly-karate-monkey_5-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Karate Monkey by Surly is a chromoly steel trail bike that has loads of versatility thanks to Surly&#8217;s famous steel builds. The 2021 Karate Monkey comes in a hardtail or full rigid build. I personally fancy the hardtail with the 140 mm travel RockShox 35 fork. (My Kona Sutra is now build out to be my dream touring rig). So I am looking for something more rowdy, to shred singletrack but the bike also needs to carry bikepacking gear.</p>



<p>The KM is a contender in my bike choice for a strong, fast and versatile hardtail bikepakcing machine. It stacks up a little <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/surly-krampus-vs-karate-monkey/">better than the Krampus</a>, being more suited to singletrack. The Karate Monkey 2021 comes with a 1&#215;12 XT, Deore groupset, with 30T crank and 11-51T cassette on the Surly Dirt Wizard 27 x 2.8&#8243; tires. The KM is great at climbing with a 17.94&#8243; climbing gear and 83&#8243; highest gear.  </p>



<p>That High fibre green really pops for me, I love it. Some people really don&#8217;t though. You might be better off with the Fools gold. Also the KM has a 120mm travel TranzX SP15 dropper post. It is suited for daily trail riding and longer singletrack-heavy bikepacking routes. Making it a great choice and one of the best bikepacking bikes for 2021. </p>



<h2>Salsa Timberjack XT</h2>

<p>The Salsa Timberjack comes in 8 different builds. For bikepacking value we recommend the XT in the 29 or 27.5 configurations. For just over $2,000 USD, it is a decent value bikepacking hardtail. If you want to spend a bit more and get a better drivetrain you can look at the GX Eagle. </p>



<p>So why the Timberjack? It has a geometry that is well balanced for both bikepacking and trail riding. With a 130mm travel fork (ability to fit uptoi a 150mm fork if you wanna explore some really challenging terrain.) And being well specced with the XT, Shimano 1&#215;12 groupset, it is oozing with value. The drivetrain gives you a 18&#8243; climbing gear and 91.50 highest gear. </p>



<p>It sees some upgrades from last years model, with a slacker head tube angle, from 67.6° to 66.35°, and a steeper seat tube, from 73.2° to 75.1°. This means a more efficient pedalling position and better riding on steep, technical descents thanks to a slacker front end. It is however a little heavy for a aluminum bike, if that bothers you, weighing in at around 32.7 lbs / 14.8 kg. </p>



<h2>Marin Pine Mountain</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="413" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4888125.jpeg?resize=720%2C413&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7166" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4888125.jpeg?w=1376&amp;ssl=1 1376w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4888125.jpeg?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4888125.jpeg?resize=1024%2C588&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4888125.jpeg?resize=768%2C441&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4888125.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4888125.jpeg?resize=346%2C200&amp;ssl=1 346w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>A ready to ride out of the box, hardtail steel bikepacking bike. The Marin Pine Mountain offers both trail riding fun and bikepacking capabilities. Ready for an adventure thanks to a plethora of mounting options, top tube mounting and too many to count inside the frame. With the option to download a diagram for making a custom frame bag to fit the frame perfectly. </p>



<p>The Pine Mountian&#8217;s Trail Geometry is a mix between agility for trail riding, and all day comfort for bikepacking. Short chains-stays keep a shorter wheelbase for that active ride, while a 66.5 degree head angle makes for confident steering with or without the weight of gear. With a slightly longer wheelbase then the Unit and identical length chainstays. (For large sized frames). Also the reach is a little shorter than something more comfortable like the Kona. </p>



<p>The Bedroll Bar from Marin features a 50mm rise and a long, straight top bar for mounting handlebar packs away from cables and controls. With ample mounting area for gadgets and bike computers. However this is an aluminum handlebar and some have claimed that it is stiff to ride on. </p>



<p>Also another let down on this bike was the Vee Flow Snap tires. Which are claimed to not preform well which is no thanks to the thin side walls. When running them with low PSI they are dangerous to ride. </p>



<p>You get a couple options with the Pine Mountain 1 and 2. Our go to would be the Pine Mountain 2 with the RockShox 35 Gold RL 120mm travel fork, 1&#215;12 SLX, FSA groupset. Which offers a 18.7&#8243; climbing gear and 95&#8243; highest gear. </p>



<p>It is a decently priced, entry level bikepacking bike, that has missed the spot on a few components and parts that may require upgrading if you really want to get the best out of this bike. </p>
