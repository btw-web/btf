<p>I honestly believe that all people can ride what ever bike. And we are going to get stereotypical in this article but it is for the better of the people who are curious specifically for womens only gravel bikes. Ladies generally have shorter torsos, narrower shoulders, longer legs, wider hips and smaller hands and feet than men. Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, as humans of all genders we vary in shape and size. But these common characteristics for women changes the relative measurements of a well-fitted bicycle frame. Meaning that geometry may vary in reach and top tube length, it will depend on your arm, leg torso ratio&#8217;s. </p>



<p>And as it doesn&#8217;t exactly matter if you buy a &#8216;women&#8217; specific gravel bike. There are some brands out there that do make ladies specific gravel bikes. And there is also other bike choices for women that have been recommended by other women gravel bike riders, that we will cover in this article. </p>



<p>Honestly I think it has more to do with body type than gender, and body type tends to trend along gender lines, but certainly not exclusively. Also if you are a smaller person it can be difficult to find a bike that fits you correctly. Especially when you intend to use it for adventure cycling here you need clearance for panniers. And it can be difficult to fit any kind of bike bag like a frame bag on really small bikes. But rest assured if this sounds like you we have some bikes that might be good.  </p>



<p>Regardless if a bike is a &#8220;man or womens&#8221; it does not matter much if it fits better on average. You want a bike that fits your body best and this doesn&#8217;t not mean that a womens bike is at all best. But bike manufacturers. Change some things on womens bikes to make them fit &#8216;better&#8217;. The saddle will be gender specific and sometimes the bars will be a bit narrower on women&#8217;s models. Also you normally see womens bikes that are smaller in reach and stand over height as well as more narrow handle bars. It is best to get the bike fit to your body at the end of the day. Your best bet is to test our a bunch of bikes, mens and womens to see what feels right for you. </p>



<p>Other factors you may see in womens bikes is that they sometimes are a tiny bit lighter because it is a tiny bit smaller. Generally womens hands are smaller and so the grips and brakes are designed to be easier for you to reach. Also a smaller framed bike will work better with 650c or 26” wheels as a 700c wheel might be just to big, and cause toe overlap. </p>



<p>Most of these gravel bikes are women specific, but there are a few which are unisex or potentially I guess mens. But I know women who still use these bikes and generally they opt for a XS or S sized frame. And that seems to work well.</p>



<p>Here is a quick view of the bikes for easier comparison. </p>

<p>After you have had a quick look at each bike. If you want to do some further comparing of components and crunching specs. </p>



<p>I have put together a in-depth comparison guide for all these bikes. Going over groupset, build, and wheel components and specs. You can download the Google Sheet for free, to help you better compare each bike and make a informed decision which bike might be best for you. </p>

<p>With the Canyon you get a generous Shimano’s new GRX400 gravel groupset which is ideal for tackling some of the more difficult climbing you can expect out there on the gravel. </p>



<p>The bike weighs in at 9.42 kg. A aluminium frame and carbon fork built bike that is fine-tuned for female riders thanks to its women’s-specific contact points, including adapted cockpit dimensions and Selle Italia women’s saddle. </p>

<p>A stealthy black looking rig! The Brava SLR, a women’s-specific cyclocross bike with disc brakes is all about performance and versatility. Yeah sorry I guess more cyclocross then gravel, but definitely still capable. It has the versatility for cross races or bikepacking adventures. </p>



<p>Made from a ALUXX SLR alloy frame features an OverDrive 2 steerer for precise handling. The top tube is shaped for mount and dismount ease as well as shouldering comfort. featuring a SRAM Apex 1 groupset with the SRAM S-350, 40t crank and SRAM PG 1130, 11&#215;42 cassette. </p>

<p>Good old Surly! The straggler is one of their gravel bikes that is a mechanical disc brake pavement and steel gravel bike. You get the option for 700c or 650b. The 650b option works best for this bike, and the clearance for 650b x 41mm or 700c x 41mm tires with fenders. Coming stock with SRAM Apex groupset. Which means a SRAM Apex 42T crank and SRAM 11-42t rear cassette. Plus you get the option to accommodate for racks and fenders.</p>

<p>Another steel gravel bike build comparable to the Straggler is Salsa take with the Vaya. This purple tone is the 105 but there is also the new Salsa&nbsp;Vaya GRX 600 available for $300 more. Categorised as a all road&nbsp;bike. it&nbsp;has clearance for tires up to 50mm without fenders or 45mm with fenders. </p>



<p>You get a smooth-riding steel frame, stable geometry, and rack mounts making it a capable bikepacking rig. You also get the waxwing carbon fork, Shimano 105 2&#215;11 drivetrain, and tubeless ready WTB Riddler tires. Not to mention the three pack mounts on the fork. The GRX 600 features a very effective 2&#215;11 gravel groupset. </p>

<p>If you are looking for a full carbon, ultra-high gravel bike. Then Juliana has you covered with this gravel grinder. Just look at this bike, it is so so nice. It is a incredibly lightweight, strong, and comfortable bike. That has taken the knowledge gained from years of mountain bike innovation, resulting in a stiff yet great off-road feeling bike.</p>



<p>It includes size specific fork offsets, 3 water bottle cage mounts and you get room for a 45mm 700c or a 2.1&#8243; 650b tire. While you get the advanced wireless electronic shifting drivetrain of the <em>SRAM Force eTap AXS</em>. A pricey bike but you get quiet a lot of high tech features at $5,899</p>

<p>This Pinnacle gravel bike is available in the UK. It has been on the market for 7 years and in 2020 it has taken on a whole new redesign. It is a versatile bike that offers it all. The new Arkose frame has full compatibility for wheel size (650B x 52C or 700C x 45mm), rear axle and Di2/cable gearing options, plus internal F+R dynamo light routing. Add this to proven handling that sits on that fine line between the best of road and gravel bike characteristics and it’s a contender for being your one do-it-all drop bar bike. </p>



<p>Featuring a 2&#215;11 speed Shimano 105/Ultegra groupset.

<p>We also have another Norco in this list, as they have a couple women gravel bike options that are both worth including here. The Section A1is a more budget friendly option compared to the Section C3 as it is alloy frame and carbon fork compared to full carbon. But you still get the same groupset and components. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=3727a95c-b736-4887-82ff-a1d0ed6654a8&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.norco.com%2Fbikes%2F2020%2Froad%2Fall-road%2Fsection-aluminum%2Fsection-a1-womens%2F">Priced at $1,799.00 At Norco.</a></p>

<p>Last but not least is Bombtrack&#8217;s Hook Womens bike. If you are after a gravel bike that is more of a adventure bike with mounting galore and all round exploring capabilities this is your bike. This bike is best compared to the Straggler and Vaya steel gravel bike options in this list. It is a 2&#215;10 speed with Shimano Tiagra that sees this bike running a BOMBTRACK LYER forged aluminum crank with 46/30T and MICROSHIFT CS-H100 10-speed cassette, 11-34T. </p>



<p>The difference with this bike is the full carbon disc fork with triple mount. Offer that little extra suppleness over the rough stuff. This bike is equipped for fast-paced riding in adventurous terrain. It is built with contact points and geometry made for women riders. The bike comes in 700c or 650B wheels on the smallest sizes ensuring handling is the same for all users, regardless of height. <a href="https://bombtrack.com/2020-hook-wmn/">Read more at Bombtrack&#8217;s website.</a> </p>
