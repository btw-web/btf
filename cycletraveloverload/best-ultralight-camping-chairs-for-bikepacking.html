<p>Some people like using camp chairs while they are out camping. But does it make sense to cart one around with you on a bike? Personally I am a spring chicken and really don&#8217;t see the need for them. But as some say in your 20&#8217;s you don&#8217;t need a camp chair but when you hit your 30&#8217;s and 40&#8217;s and beyond &#8220;you need a camp chair&#8221;. However true this is, it seems like a interesting piece of gear to take along for you on a bike adventure.  </p>



<p>Now obviously the chairs that we are going to mention in this article are ultralight and pack relatively small making them great for bikepacking and bicycle touring. It does seem like one of those luxury items when out exploring by bike. But so many adventure cyclists have made it work for them. Since you are spending all day in your bike saddle riding, the altered position of a camp chair that has a back rest is quiet appealing. Compared to sitting on your sleeping pad with not much support. And I can see why many have one for their cycling adventures. </p>



<p>Depending on where you are traveling however it kind of seems unnecessary to cart around a camping chair on your bike when you could just find rocks and logs with a sleeping pad and create your own chair. But in some spots in Australia bull ants and other creators could be a problem. And then it would make more sense to travel with a camping chair. </p>



<p>Some people like the idea of a comfy camping chair as a nice thing to have at night for reading or star gazing. And I can see the allure towards them, but I have a very minimalist outlook when it comes to bikepacking and not sure if I would personally use the chair enough to make it worth carrying. But maybe I will convince myself by the end of this article. </p>

<p>A alternative to a chair and a potentially lighter weight setup. Some bike tourers recommend a hammock and using it as a sleeping system but also a chair when you want to sit. </p>



<p>Most lightweight chairs are around the 2 pounds or just under 1 kg but there are even lighter options on the market. Anything around that 1 kg range and under should be ideal for bike camping. </p>



<p>If you really want to get resourceful and not take a chair at all you could use your bike laying on its side as a back rest and use your sleeping pad in a L shape which could work. But it seems the main reasons people are after a camping chair for bikepacking is for ease of getting up and down, while also providing comfort which also would make your nights that much more pleasant. Furthermore some of the chairs mentioned here are designed to keep you off the ground. </p>



<p>But why take a chair when you could ride a couch?</p>

<p>I just had to share this it made me crack up! In all seriousness though, some of the chairs listed down below are light enough at under 500 grams where you could probably justify taking a camp chair bikepacking. I guess we all need at least one luxury item on such adventures to get that little feel of home when we are on the road. And why not have a chair? </p>



<p>So lets dive into some of the best ultralight camping chairs on the market which are backed by fellow bikepacking enthusiasts, which they personally use and recommend for others. </p>

<p>The Helinox Zero is the go to ultralight chair when it comes to bikepacking. So many of the people I talked to use this exact chair and most are very satisfied with it. A super lightweight, compact camping that weighs just 1.1 pounds or 498 grams and packs smaller than a bottle of water (measures 4 x 4 x 14 inches or 10.2 x 10.2 x 35.5 cm packed). </p>



<p>The chairs frame is constructed from advanced proprietary aluminum alloy to provide maximum strength at a minimum weight, holding up to 260 pounds or 118 kg. The seat and carry sack are constructed from durable, lightweight ripstop polyester that resists harsh weather and UV rays.</p>

<p>Out of the Chair One and Chair Zero the &#8216;One&#8217; which is another model by Helinox is said to be more comfortable to some people, as you get more chair. But for bikepacking the Zero is ideal when packing volume and weight are the main priority. It is still comfy after a big day riding. </p>



<p>It would be cool to see them design a chair that has the dimension, lean and hight of the One but built with the light materials of the Zero. Not sure what the end product would be but it would be light and even more comfortable.  The chair sits low to the ground which is perfect for cooking. To get up you just need to place your hands on the fabric edges and push. Setup is quiet easy to, just &#8220;twirl&#8221; the center horizontal shaft and every section just snaps into place. Folding up takes a bit more time but not so much that you won&#8217;t use the chair even on short breaks. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="718" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/71-vbmRTCLL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=720%2C718&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4795" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/71-vbmRTCLL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/71-vbmRTCLL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/71-vbmRTCLL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/71-vbmRTCLL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C765&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/71-vbmRTCLL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=1024%2C1021&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/71-vbmRTCLL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/71-vbmRTCLL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The price is the only real downside to this chair, depending on your budget. I have heard people using these chairs for over 6 years until they start running into long term wear and other issues. But that is a long self life. For the <a href="https://amzn.to/2vZ3DjR">price of $119.95 on Amazon</a> you get a ultralight chair that is one of the best for bikepacking purposes!</p>



<h2>REI Co-op Flexlite Air Chair</h2>

<p>The REI Air Chair is a camping chair that even those gram counting bikepackers will love! For just one extra pound or 454 grams, you get the luxury of sitting high and dry, out of the reach of poking pine needles. </p>



<p>Setup is said to be rather easy using an aluminum frame that&#8217;s similar to the frame on a lightweight tent; 4-leg design provides stability. Sturdy ripstop nylon seat has a durable water repellent (DWR) finish to shed light rain and stains. Folds down easily to store in the included stuff sack. It provides a 250 pound or 113.4 kg weight capacity. </p>

<h4>Helinox Chair Zero Vs REI Co-op Flexlite Air</h4>



<p>When compared to the Helinox Zero this chair is cheaper and slightly lighter but here are some pros and cons when comparing this chair to the Zero from a owner who has used both chairs:</p>



<p><strong>Compared to it, here are some pros for REI Flexlite Air</strong></p>



<ul><li>More stable from front to back, the legs are oriented perpendicular to the way Helinox chair zero&#8217;s are.</li><li>Price ($20 less than Helinox zero)</li><li>Allows for more relaxed and less upright seated position (although accommodates both well)</li><li>Allows wider bodied people</li><li>Uses one piece, hole-less nylon canvas sitting material</li></ul>



<p><strong>Compared to Chair Helinox Zero, here are some cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Less material where the legs fit into the chair, long term durability may be questionable.</li><li>You sit-on more than sit-in, or in other words your butt doesn&#8217;t sit as deep as with the Helinox chair. This might not necessarily be a con though, depending on your preference.</li><li>It uses a loose fitting, mesh stuff sack, the Helinox uses a much more tightly fitted sack</li></ul>



<p>Overall REI I have done a good job offering a ultralight chair that stands up well compared to some of the other models and for a cheaper price of <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F148036%2Frei-co-op-flexlite-air-chair">$99.95 at REI.com.</a></p>

<p>The Big Agnes Skyline chair is another option for a ultrlight chair for bikepacking. Weighs just over 1 pound, for ease of transport to any destination and the chair packs small into included stuff sack. It features a fully shockcorded architecture and color-coded frame offer simple setup and breakdown. It also has a patented hubless frame construction which allows smaller pack size. Pre-bent poles enhance comfort by creating a wider, more stable seat. High-tenacity Robic™ nylon is lightweight and durable; waterproof UTS coating gives fabric a soft feel and enhances tear strength.</p>



<p>This chair does have some more advanced features then the REI chair which makes it seem worth the little extra <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F149711%2Fbig-agnes-skyline-ul-chair">$109.95 at REI.com.</a> The construction and quality of this chair is one of the best for bikepacking. With those heavy duty poles poles made from aircraft-grade aluminum with steel cores at the joints. Just features all around build quality. Even the  fabric seat is bulletproof.</p>



<p>This chair is heavier then the Zero, however having a higher seat height and slightly wider chair could be worth the extra ounces. If you have the extra space (it’s about 5 inches longer than the chair zero when packed) and want to sit more than 11 inches off the ground this is highly recommended. </p>



<h2>Cheap Amazon Ultralight Chair</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/81AtmFOIp0L._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=414%2C489&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4796" width="414" height="489" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/81AtmFOIp0L._AC_SL1500_.jpg?w=1269&amp;ssl=1 1269w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/81AtmFOIp0L._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=254%2C300&amp;ssl=1 254w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/81AtmFOIp0L._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C908&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/81AtmFOIp0L._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=866%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 866w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/81AtmFOIp0L._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=42%2C50&amp;ssl=1 42w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you are on a budget and don&#8217;t want to spend some extra money on insuring that you get the best quality products for bikepacking. Then you can take a risk with some cheap Amazon products. There is always some cheaper versions of some of the better quality stuff available on Amazon. Thanks to people getting stuff made in China and selling them on Amazon at massively reduced prices. </p>



<p>I really am not sure when it comes to quality and durability when it comes to these types of products. But for 1/3 to 1/4 of the retail price for some of these other chairs it could be a good option. </p>



<p>This chair does weigh almost twice as much as the lightest options though at around 2.1 pounds or 960 grams. The packed size is around 11 x 4.3 x 6 inches or 36 x 11 x 15 cm. And a claimed max load of 300 pounds /135 kg sitting weight. </p>



<p>I am actually quiet surprised with the Amazon reviews of this product, they are rather good, if you don&#8217;t believe me give them a read <a href="https://amzn.to/38Fmgqj">here</a>. But this chair does lack some sturdiness like the others, it just doesn&#8217;t support you. There&#8217;s no arm rests and it stops short on the back as well as behind the legs. It&#8217;s also a bit &#8216;rocky&#8217; in that it does flex forwards and backwards with body movement. Also the assembly takes little to master, it is described as very easy but actually is quite tricky to get the last hole in. You can take the chance with something like this as it is only priced at <a href="https://amzn.to/38Fmgqj">$34.97 on Amazon</a>. But it is not the lightest camping chair out there, and I would be worried about how long the chair would hold up to use when bikepacking. </p>



<h2>Trekker Chair Kit</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tr_lifestyle_trekkerchair_2.jpg?resize=481%2C361&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4800" width="481" height="361" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tr_lifestyle_trekkerchair_2.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tr_lifestyle_trekkerchair_2.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tr_lifestyle_trekkerchair_2.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>That is it for the ultralight chair recommendations. But before you go, if you have a Therm-a-Rest sleeping pad you should look into this chair kit system. It allows you to turn your sleeping pad into a upright chair with a back rest. You are still on the ground though with this setup. But it&#8217;s hard to deny yourself the added luxury and convenience of a chair when it only weighs 10 oz (290 g). The Trekker Chair uses ultralight nylon and fiberglass poles to pack small and creates a comfy place to rest and recover after a long day of bikepacking. Starting from <a href="https://amzn.to/2ICnAj3">$39.95 on Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>It seems that you only get the option of chosing two out of these three options when it comes to selecting the right bike camping chair. </p>



<ul><li>Light weight</li></ul>



<ul><li>Comfortable</li></ul>



<ul><li>Cheap</li></ul>



<p>If you opt for a cheap and comfortable chair it is most likely not going to be lightweight. And the same with a lightweight chair that is comfortable it is going to cost some extra cash. However not to sure how you would go with a cheap and lightweight chair, as most of the cheap chairs are heavier, but again you will most likely sacrifice comfort which is kind of the purpose of getting a camping chair in the first place. To relax at the end of a hard day riding. But whatever you choose you should be fine with any of these models above. </p>
