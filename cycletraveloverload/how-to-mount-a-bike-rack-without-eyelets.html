<h3>Bike Racks That Work Without Eyelets</h3>



<p>There are a number of different rack options on the market that will work on your bike regardless if it has no eyelets. Such racks use alternative designs then more traditional racks to mount on the bike. It is best if you go for a rack that is recommended down below. But also as I will let you know more about first you can get around this by less cost effect mounting DIY fixes that don&#8217;t require you to go out and buy a new bike rack. So lets just quickly cover a few of these methods first and then get into the racks</p>



<p>If your bike does not have eyelets there are some solution you can try to get some racks on your road bike. Below I have listed from most practical and durable to least.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="470" height="470" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/32521_tortec_p_clips.jpg?w=640" alt="" class="wp-image-615" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/32521_tortec_p_clips.jpg?w=470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/32521_tortec_p_clips.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/32521_tortec_p_clips.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>P-Clamps</strong>&nbsp;aka cushioned metal loop straps, might be the solution you are looking for and can be a alternative to mounting a rear rack to a bike that has no eyelets. Cheap and simple to use, you can find them in most hardware stores. They come in a variety of different sizes so you are bound to find one that will fit the needed tube diameter. They are very simple to install, just open the clamp and place over the fork blade or seat stay, then close shut, tightening with a bolt, they will not slip.</p>

<p><strong>Tubus Stay Mounting Clamps</strong> Similar to the P-Clamps but made specifically for fitting Tubus Racks to a bike that has no eyelets.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="425" height="425" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/51N4AZQFEXL._SX425_.jpg?w=640" alt="" class="wp-image-623" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/51N4AZQFEXL._SX425_.jpg?w=425&amp;ssl=1 425w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/51N4AZQFEXL._SX425_.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/51N4AZQFEXL._SX425_.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Seatpost Clamps With Rack Eyelets</strong> Some racks are designed to suit mounting with a seatpost clamp with appropriate rack eyelets. Which are great for road bikes that don’t have eyelets for mounting racks.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="466" height="197" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/7194xk2OssL._SX466_.jpg?w=640" alt="" class="wp-image-624" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/7194xk2OssL._SX466_.jpg?w=466&amp;ssl=1 466w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/7194xk2OssL._SX466_.jpg?resize=300%2C127&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Tubus Quick Release Rack Mounting Kit</strong> This is great if your bike does not have lower eyelets. Allowing you to mount the frame using a quick release mounting design. </p>



<p>These are just some of the quick fixes to make most any rack work with a bike that does not have eyelets. So maybe you have a front suspension rack that is obviously not designed with eyelets and mounting a front rack. However there are quiet a few racks that will do the job. </p>



<h4>Zefal Raider Front Rack</h4>



<div class="wp-block-jetpack-tiled-gallery aligncenter is-style-columns"><div class="tiled-gallery__gallery"><div class="tiled-gallery__row"><div class="tiled-gallery__col"><figure class="tiled-gallery__item"><img srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/raider-front-1.png?strip=all&#038;w=585&#038;ssl=1 585w" alt="" data-height="585" data-id="4491" data-link="https://cycletraveloverload.com/?attachment_id=4491" data-url="https://cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/raider-front-1.png" data-width="603" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/raider-front-1.png?ssl=1"/></figure></div><div class="tiled-gallery__col"><figure class="tiled-gallery__item"><img srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/raider-front-1.jpg?strip=all&#038;w=600&#038;ssl=1 600w,https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/raider-front-1.jpg?strip=all&#038;w=727&#038;ssl=1 727w" alt="" data-height="727" data-id="4492" data-link="https://cycletraveloverload.com/?attachment_id=4492" data-url="https://cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/raider-front-1.jpg" data-width="567" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/raider-front-1.jpg?ssl=1"/></figure></div></div></div></div>



<p>This rack is suitable for suspension forks and mounts on the top end to your breaks and bottom clamps the wrap around the fork. This fork is durable, lightweight and high resistance to corrosion made from aluminum. And is very adjustable with the ability to suit different types of bikes.</p>



<h4><strong>Thule Pack ‘N Pedal Tour Racks</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="900" height="595" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/57-1.jpg?w=640" alt="" class="wp-image-627" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/57-1.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/57-1.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/57-1.jpg?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p>More suited for Carbon bikes as it wraps around the seat stays and fork. You will only be able to carry smaller loads with this setup.</p>



<h4><strong>Axiom Streamliner Racks</strong></h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="560" height="560" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/streamliner-road-dlx-1_1.jpg?w=640" alt="" class="wp-image-625" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/streamliner-road-dlx-1_1.jpg?w=560&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/streamliner-road-dlx-1_1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/streamliner-road-dlx-1_1.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></figure>



<p>Great for road bikes as the rack mounts onto the brake bridge and uses quick release on the lower mounting.</p>



<h4><strong>Old Man Mountain</strong> </h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="707" height="850" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/old-man-mountain-sherpa-20-rear-rack.jpg?w=640" alt="" class="wp-image-619" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/old-man-mountain-sherpa-20-rear-rack.jpg?w=707&amp;ssl=1 707w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/old-man-mountain-sherpa-20-rear-rack.jpg?resize=250%2C300&amp;ssl=1 250w" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px" /></figure>



<p>Make some quality rear racks that are suited to every bike regardless if it has eyelets or not. The rack is attached to an extra long quick release skewer (which is included) that replaces the original one.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="466" height="407" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/6141B5E4FKL._SX466_.jpg?w=640" alt="" class="wp-image-617" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/6141B5E4FKL._SX466_.jpg?w=466&amp;ssl=1 466w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/6141B5E4FKL._SX466_.jpg?resize=300%2C262&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /></figure></div>



<p>A <strong>seat-post mounted rack</strong> maybe something you can look into. In my opinion I think they add extra stress on the seat post if the rack is under a substantial weight. Also the handling with this type of setup is a bit cumbersome. Comparing to a traditional rear rack on a touring bike that is. Maybe it is the high of the rack and the weight, plus a light bike. I would not necessarily recommend this system for a longterm setup.</p>



<p>Whatever way you look at it there is always a way around not having eyelets on your current bike. You can mount racks on your bike if you get creative. Hopefully some of these suggestions are helpful to you. </p>
