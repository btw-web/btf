<p>So you love your coffee? As a fellow Melbournian I love coffee, and a really nice coffee at that! You know, something like a Soy Cap gets me grooving. But when it comes to bikepacking does this luxury fall out the window? Well no, there are many ways to make some nice coffee while out on the road and even brew your own, to make that perfect cup!</p>



<p>When it comes to coffee prep and maximum enjoyment you can buy the most amazing coffee machine when you are at home and make some really tasty stuff. But is this all sacrificed when you hit the trails for backcountry adventures? It depends on what you are like, but when bikepacking the making of coffee becomes more challenging. As your main priorities are maximum efficiency, ease of making the coffee and utilising all of your space on bike. So you have to find that nice balance. For super easy coffee Instant is recommended but if you are one for enjoyment and amazing tasting coffee then you may have to take up some space for nicer equipment to make that perfect cup. </p>



<p>Before we jump into the coffee makers and your bikepacking coffee kits. Lets first talk about the a popular way in which to make coffee. </p>



<h3>Cowboy Coffee</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="How to Make Cowboy Coffee" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7UAoT21eqXI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>You could brew cowboy coffee in a pot then make it drinkable by using a tiny lightweight reusable filter over your mug. For a simple method for making coffee that works rather well when it comes to bikepacking. </p>



<p>I surveyed many bikepackers, asking them what they do for coffee when bikepacking? Do they have a mini coffee maker? I thought it would be cool to see what others are doing when it comes to coffee and bikepacking. In this blog post we are going to talk about all the different ways people make coffee while out exploring on their bike. Keep in mind that I asked specifically for bikepacking as this requires smaller equipment due to the limited storage space so all these suggestions will work when bikepacking with minimal storage space which is great! If you are bike touring then you also have no worries. So sit back, grab a coffee! Oh, wait maybe you need to read this post to figure out what you are going to get to make a coffee&#8230;. Oh, sorry don&#8217;t mind me! </p>



<h2>Instant/Decaf Coffee</h2>



<p>This is rather straight forward there are many instant coffee options out there. Just boil up some water in a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bikepacking-stoves-best-camping-stove-for-bikepacking/">bikepacking stove</a> and add to a cup and you are pretty much done. </p>



<h3>Folgers Instant</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/91CenwFKG8L._SL1500_.jpg?fit=547%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4516" width="185" height="345" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/91CenwFKG8L._SL1500_.jpg?w=802&amp;ssl=1 802w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/91CenwFKG8L._SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C1436&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/91CenwFKG8L._SL1500_.jpg?resize=547%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 547w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/91CenwFKG8L._SL1500_.jpg?resize=27%2C50&amp;ssl=1 27w" sizes="(max-width: 185px) 100vw, 185px" /></figure></div>



<p>Coffee is a touchy subject and each person has different tastes but these two instant coffee options seem to be the most popular when it comes to bikepackers taste buds. Folgers is a good coffee, even for instant. Dissolves perfectly. Good with milk/water and hot/cold. Great price and value! It has some great reviews on Amazon and you can get a pack of 1 x 226 grams for <a href="https://amzn.to/2NujV9X">$4.94</a></p>



<h3>Starbucks Via Instant Coffee</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/81PR-BAC6YL._SL1500_.jpg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4517" width="485" height="485" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/81PR-BAC6YL._SL1500_.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/81PR-BAC6YL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/81PR-BAC6YL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/81PR-BAC6YL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/81PR-BAC6YL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/81PR-BAC6YL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/81PR-BAC6YL._SL1500_.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /></figure></div>



<p>Starbucks is another popular option with bikepackers when it comes to instant coffee. They have many different flavours to choose from. Made with the same 100%&nbsp;<em>arabica</em>&nbsp;beans, Starbucks VIA&nbsp;Instant offers the same Starbucks&nbsp;coffee in an instant. 1 box include 8 packets. <a href="https://amzn.to/38bsNJy">From $14.96</a></p>



<p>For me I am more a barista style coffee guy! You know that really fresh tasting stuff? And they require some kind of coffee making contraption. </p>



<h2>Bikepacking Coffee Setups and Makers</h2>



<p>Some of the options include french press and other press method coffee makers, then you have grinders and other cool coffee makers too. </p>



<h3>AeroPress Go</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/aeropress-go-2-transparent.png?fit=640%2C571&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4520" width="397" height="354" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/aeropress-go-2-transparent.png?w=1187&amp;ssl=1 1187w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/aeropress-go-2-transparent.png?resize=300%2C267&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/aeropress-go-2-transparent.png?resize=768%2C685&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/aeropress-go-2-transparent.png?resize=1024%2C913&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/aeropress-go-2-transparent.png?resize=50%2C45&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /></figure></div>



<p>The AeroPress Go gives you the same capabilities when it comes to making coffee as the original AeroPress, but in a smaller travel friendly size, making it a great choice for bikepacking. I was going to include the original in these options of coffee setups but there is no need with this little ripper. It is able to make remarkably delicious American, espresso, and cold brew style coffee. The AeroPress Go is optimized for traveling, camping, or just going to work by making it convenient and easy to take your AeroPress with you. Its smart design ensures that you will never be without delicious AeroPress brewed coffee wherever you go. <a href="https://amzn.to/376H6Pj">Priced at $31.95 on Amazon.</a> </p>

<p>I have met a few bike travellers who use these coffee makers and have had the chance to use one for myself and they are actually pretty cool. You can pick up so many different brands out there.

<h2>Bikepacking Cups and Mugs</h2>



<p>The trusty bikepacking dangle mug! For those of you who are not familiar with a mugs purpose in bikepacking. And where do you store the mug. It often can be attached to the outside of your saddle bag, hence the name. Having a sweet mug handing off your bike looks cool! But don&#8217;t they get dirty?</p>



<p>Reddit folklore once said that they take two mugs! One to dangle (for looks) and another stowed away in there bags (the one they actually use for coffee). Two mugs this is genius! Well, I am hoping you picked up on my sarcasm. Yes the mug will get dirty and at this point &#8216;dangle mugs&#8217; are becoming a meme of bikepacking in a way! But it might be something that is worth sacrificing for those instagram worthy shots. </p>



<p>Titanium seems like a rather popular material choice when it comes to mugs for bikepacking. As they are lightweight, corrosion resistant, Safe: Titanium in a non-toxic metal and doesn&#8217;t react with food, Durable: Can handle a bit of rough handling and wont chip like your old enamel camping cup and most of them can be heated directly over a flame. </p>
