<p>Today we are going to take a look at the Selle Anatomica saddles. They look rather similar to Brooks. But are a more modern take on the old school design. </p>



<p>They make a few different models based on rider weight. Later on we will cover the different models and help you to figure out which one is better for you. </p>



<p>For the Selle Anatomica saddles they focus a lot on offer more comfort then the Brooks. Or that is what they say. And for good reason, let me explain. They have unique slot cut out down the middle of the saddle which offers comfort by allowing each sit bone to move independently. This further relieves pressure from the perineal&nbsp;area. Also the Flex-Fly Slot&nbsp;cutout gives the saddle a bit more flex and moves with your peddling motion pretty naturally. Also it acts as a bit of suspension when going over bumps.</p>



<p>The biggest selling point for me when it comes to this saddle is the instant comfort on bike. There is no need to wait out a break in period on this saddle compared to something like the brooks. It is comfortable from day one. </p>



<p>They also offer the longest rails in the industry which means more seatback. They have two kinds of leather, veg and watershed. The veg leather is dipped in vegetable oil and is said to last longer. It does however take a little more time to be comfortable then the water sed leather but it is more durable. </p>



<h2>Benefits Of The Selle Anatomica </h2>



<p>It is important to note that there are known and well documented medical issues associated with riding bicycles for prolonged periods of time. And this is why Selle Anatomica took it upon themselves to produce a saddle that would combat these issues. </p>



<p>One of the main issues for riders with uncomfortable bike saddles was the pelvic floor &amp; sit bone related issues. It is a relatively weak structure and is not designed to withstand extremes of weight bearing on it and does not shield the neurovascular structures in that area well. Selle Anatomica saddles offer central pressure relief in this area. Allowing the saddle to flex superiorly and inferiorly independently on the left and right sides and provide internal/external rotation in sync with the riders pedalling motion. The saddle also helps with prostate relief. </p>



<h2>Selle Anatomica Saddle Line Up</h2>



<p>So lets have a look at the Selle Anatomica saddle options and what each one is best for. When it comes to these saddles they don&#8217;t offer different widths or gender specific models. They focus mainly on offering a different range of saddles based on your weight and the amount of miles you plan to ride. </p>



<p>Here is a quick look at the leather saddle line up compared to each other with some insightful details that I hope helps you in making a purchasing decision. I put together a FREE downloadable Google Doc detailing all the specs and differences of each saddle in a easy to view way! (leather saddles only) The other two &#8211; R2 and C Series Carbon are in a different league. </p>

<p>If you are after a in-depth showdown with <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/brooks-vs-selle-anatomica-which-is-the-best-saddle/">Selle Anatomica and Brooks saddles</a>. I wrote a blog article thoroughly detailing what the difference is between each saddle and which one would be better for you. Feel free to head over and give that a good read. </p>



<p>In this article I outline much more detail about each saddle brand. But in summary, I have covered some of the benefits of the Selle Anatomica but there are some small things worth considering that are not so good about this saddle. </p>



<p>Some users have reported that this saddle can get squeaky at times. Especially when used in dusty environments.</p>



<p>Also the rails can bend easily if you are not careful. There are different weight requirements for the leather and the rails. According to the company, there are also requirements for where on the rail you install it and what type of body frame you have. Make sure to look into these details to see if you will be a appropriate weight for the saddle you are looking at.</p>



<p>Overall they are good saddles for touring, commuting or cycle travel in general. They have a unique selling point with the patent cutout design that in theory seems super beneficial to reduce pain and pressure down there. Definitely worth considering!</p>
