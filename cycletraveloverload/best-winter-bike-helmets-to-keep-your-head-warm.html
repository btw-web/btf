<p>Riding during the colder times of the year? Or do you live in a rather cold location? Is making the plunge to purchase a winter bike helmet worth it? That&#8217;s what we are going to cover in this article and by the end we will have suggestions for some of the best winter bike helmets. </p>



<p>Why not just use a beanie underneath your normal bike helmet? It seems like a rather valid point, doesn&#8217;t it? As bike traveler&#8217;s we have a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-winter-cycling-shoes-boots-2020/">number of options when it comes to winter shoes.</a> Maybe we should just use a ski or snowboarding helmet? </p>



<p>Before you go grab your snowboarding helmet out of the cupboard and head out on a frezzing bikepacking trip. You might want to reconsider. We are lucky that bike brand manufacturers are always pushing the envelope and coming up with new and emerging gear to make life on the bike that little bit more comfortable. </p>



<p>Snowboarding helmets are simply too bulky and don&#8217;t provide enough ventilation. They often have too much padding and size to them for cycling. An ideal winter bike helmet would be something that offers some kind of lining, with ear flaps, and vents that can be open or closed while riding. And ultimately much lighter weight.</p>



<p>What are the alternatives? You could get a size larger helmet and pair that with something like a balaclava if you are looking for a budget approach. Or even a beanie under the helmet as suggested. But these all have their drawbacks. And the big one is ventilation and the ability to keep your head warm in extreme temperatures. 45Nrth make a specific product handy for this! <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F138875%2F45nrth-greazy-merino-wool-cap">The Greazy</a> is a merino wool cycling cap or earlap cap, that is made to fit underneath a helmet with ear and eye coverage from the cold. </p>



<p>I am not sure about you. But if I was in the market for a winter bike helmet I would want a biking specific cold weather helmet. Not sure if it is a good idea to use a ski specific helmet for cycling. As there is that potential that ski and snowboarding helmets might conform to a different set of safety standards then bike helmets. </p>



<p>But let&#8217;s take a look at some of the best winter bike helmets on the market today. </p>

<p>This is a winter bike helmet that features a insulated cold weather liner which helps keep you warm in chilly conditions. In a one size fits all system it also has a integrated LED taillight for that added safety while out on the road. And you also get the MIPS technology for next level helmet protection. <a href="https://www.specialized.com/ca/en/centro-winter-led/p/162041">Priced at $110.00</a></p>



<h3>Garneau Ghost Helmet</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/10297686x1041561_zm.jpeg?resize=404%2C404&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5921" width="404" height="404" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/10297686x1041561_zm.jpeg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/10297686x1041561_zm.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/10297686x1041561_zm.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/10297686x1041561_zm.jpeg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Designed specifically for fat biking. it offers more ventilation then a ski helmet and as fat biking in the snow is common this makes for the perfect helmet for the job! Featuring the Spiderlock Creo retention system that can be easily adjusted using just one hand for a comfortable fit. Again well ventilated with a number of 10 vents. The in-mould construction of the helmet features evacuation channels to insure your head is well protected but also stop overheating. It also has earpads to shield you from the cold that can also be detached as it gets warmer. Furthermore it even has a goggle fastener at the back to hold your goggles in place. Total weight is 12.4 oz or 350 grams. Also the helmet passes cycling crash safety standards. <a href="https://garneau.com/us_en/ghost-helmet-1406255">Priced at $37.99</a></p>



<h3>Lazer Dissent Helmet</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/@AaronWHautala_LazerDissent9085.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5922" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/@AaronWHautala_LazerDissent9085.jpg?w=3072&amp;ssl=1 3072w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/@AaronWHautala_LazerDissent9085.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/@AaronWHautala_LazerDissent9085.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/@AaronWHautala_LazerDissent9085.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/@AaronWHautala_LazerDissent9085.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/@AaronWHautala_LazerDissent9085.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/@AaronWHautala_LazerDissent9085.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Another winter bike helmet best suited for fat biking. From my understanding Lazer is a cheap bike helmet brand you can pick up at Walmart. Not too sure on how well made these are. But seem like a good entry level option. It is a durable and comfortable helmet, perfect for winter riding. Rating by fellow fat bikers. It has vent flow adjustability for when the temperatures change with the 13 adapt vents with IN/OUT design. Even if you are wearing gloves the magic magnetic buckle closure makes it easy to use. The earpads are removable for warmer weather and they are also compatible with Lazer&#8217;s goggle integration. Weight comes in at 418 grams and prices vary. </p>



<h3>Giro Timberwolf</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FLAOR.jpg?resize=427%2C427&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5923" width="427" height="427" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FLAOR.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FLAOR.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FLAOR.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FLAOR.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FLAOR.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Personally I am a big fan of the Giro helmets. They offer their own take on the winter bike helmet. With the Timberwolf designed for chilly temperatures they have taken inspiration from snow helmet profiles. featuring the Thermostat Control ventilation system allowing you to control how much ventilation comes through. Also paired with the warmth from the brushed fleece liner and removable ear pads. The Front Stack Ventilation reduces goggle fogging. Ideal for cold-weather mountain biking, commuting and fat bikepacking. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=92594cfb-2b30-40ba-ab76-f9c20ed4612c&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgiro-timberwolf-helmet">Priced at $119.95</a> </p>



<h3>Bern&nbsp;Brentwood 2.0 Bike Helmet</h3>

<p>The original Brentwood helmets had a great following behind them. Since Bern have updated with the 2.0 option that includes all the features in their bestselling Brentwood model with an updated, modern look and improved fit. It is one f the more versatile bike helmets. Not a dedicated winter bike helmet. it is best suited for those looking to commute and who dig that old school skater helmet vibes. The Bern Zipmold+ technology gives a low-profile fit that&#8217;s lightweight and has a higher strength-to-weight ratio than in-mold helmets. It has 13 vents for great ventilation on those warmer days. The removable visor allows customization. If you are looking to use this in winter it is ideal if you can get the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F160317%2Fbern-brentwood-20-winter-helmet-liner-with-crank-fit">winter liner for the Brentwood</a> (for a extra $30.00), which features ear flaps.
