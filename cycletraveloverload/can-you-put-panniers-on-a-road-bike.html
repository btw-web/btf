<p>So you want to try out bike touring but only have a road bike? You are heading in the right direction, some people wait until they have the right gear to go, but using what you already have is a great way to get started. </p>



<p>The short answer is yes, it is possible to turn your road bike into a touring bike. You can mount panniers on your road bike, regardless if the frame has no eyelets to attach a rack. Today I am going to walk you through your potential options. </p>



<h4><strong>Can you use road bike for touring?</strong></h4>



<p>If you plan to fully loaded tour with multiple panniers and all your camping gear then a road bike might be out of the question. As road bikes are not made to carry all that extra weight. The frame and wheels will struggle under additional weight and you are likely to run into mechanical issues. If however you plan to go on a light bicycle touring adventure then you could make it work. But my advice is, if you want to go on an around the country or world tour best bet is to get a dedicated <strong><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-touring-bikes-2022/">touring bike</a></strong>. </p>



<h2>Mounting Racks On Your Road Bike</h2>



<p>Some entry level Trek and Giant road bikes do allow the option to attack racks with eyelets on the bikes frame. But some other road bikes don&#8217;t give you this option. </p>



<h2>What if my bike doesn’t have eyelets?</h2>



<p>If your bike does not have eyelets there are some solution you can try to get some racks on your road bike. Below I have listed from most practical and durable to least. </p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" width="470" height="470" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/32521_tortec_p_clips.jpg?resize=470%2C470" alt="" class="wp-image-615" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/32521_tortec_p_clips.jpg?w=470&amp;ssl=1 470w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/32521_tortec_p_clips.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/32521_tortec_p_clips.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p><strong>P-Clamps</strong> aka cushioned metal loop straps, might be the solution you are looking for and can be a alternative to mounting a rear rack to a bike that has no eyelets. Cheap and simple to use, you can find them in most hardware stores. They come in a variety of different sizes so you are bound to find one that will fit the needed tube diameter. They are very simple to install, just open the clamp and place over the fork blade or seat stay, then close shut, tightening with a bolt, they will not slip. </p>

<p><strong>Seatpost Clamps With Rack Eyelets</strong></p>



<p>Some racks are designed to suit mounting with a seatpost clamp with appropriate rack eyelets. Which are great for road bikes that don&#8217;t have eyelets for mounting racks. </p>

<p>More suited for Carbon bikes as it wraps around the seat stays and fork. You will only be able to carry smaller loads with this setup. </p>

<p>Great for road bikes as the rack mounts onto the brake bridge and uses quick release on the lower mounting.  </p>

<p><strong>Old Man Mountain</strong> Make some quality rear racks that are suited to every bike regardless if it has eyelets or not. The rack is attached to an extra long quick release skewer (which is included) that replaces the original one. </p>

<p>A <strong>seat-post mounted rack</strong> maybe something you can look into. In my opinion I think they add extra stress on the seat post if the rack is under a substantial  weight. Also the handling with this type of setup is a bit cumbersome. Comparing to a traditional rear rack on a touring bike that is. Maybe it is the high of the rack and the weight, plus a light bike. I would not necessarily recommend this system for a longterm setup.  </p>
</div></div>



<h2>Chain-stay length?</h2>



<p>It should be mentioned that a typical road bike is not designed with touring in mind. This should not stop you from using you road bike, but the chain stay length on a standard touring bike is a little longer then a road bike. As touring bikes are designed with a rear pannier setup in mind, and allows some extra room.<strong> You could expect clearance issue with your heal&nbsp;knocking the panniers when pedalling. </strong></p>



<p>In comparison a Road&nbsp;bikes chain-stay is : 40.5 to 41.5cm (less than 16 ½ inches). When a&nbsp;Touring bikes is : 42 to 43.5cm (less than 17 ½ inches). That is roughly on average 2.5 cm (1 inch) in difference. </p>



<p>If you do find that you are striking your panniers it could be because they are too large or you just have huge feet. A potential way around this is to get smaller sized panniers. You should be okay with a pair of Ortlieb&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.ortliebusa.com/prodInfo.asp?pid=6&amp;cid=2" target="_blank">Sport Packers</a>, Arkel&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.arkel-od.com/us/all-categories/touring-bike-bag/xm-28-touring-accessories.html" target="_blank">XM-28’s</a> or even Lone Peak&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.thetouringstore.com/LONE%20PEAK/LP%20PANNIERS/P100/P100%20PANNIERS%20PAGE.htm" target="_blank">Summits</a>. </p>



<h2>Rack Construction</h2>



<p>It is recommended to get bike racks that are made from steel, as these are almost guaranteed to last a lifetime of bike touring wear. Oppose to aluminium racks with have a tendency to wear over time. </p>



<p>High quality steel racks are more expensive then most aluminium racks. But ill last a lot longer. </p>



<h2>Can You Tour On A Road Bike?</h2>

<p>When it is not ideal for longer tours, <strong>Yes you can tour on a road bike. </strong></p>



<p>My first tour was with a road bike. I used a Giant Defy 3 (2014). There is no excuse to get out there and give bicycle touring a go. This setup was so cheap, I bought a <strong>seat post rear rack</strong> and very cheap and bad rear panniers on eBay. And just used the road bike that I already had at the time. It was not the most fun tour that is for sure, but I learnt a lot from this experience. <strong>My point here is that it is possible to tour on a road bike. </strong>And you could make your experience much better in comparison to my first tour from learning from my mistakes. </p>



<h2>Even Weight Distribution</h2>



<p>When packing your bike with all your gear, keep in mind to distribute the weight as even as you can. Having too much weight at the rear will wear the back tyres down much faster. And be more prone to flats. Try getting front panniers too, frame bag, top tube bags, handlebar bags. To get some of that weight to the mid and front section of the bike. It may be difficult to ride at first but after some practise you will adjust. </p>



<h2>Maybe Try Bikepacking!</h2>



<p>Depending on the amount of gear you plan on taking in terms of volume, you could try bikepacking. I am moving more towards this style of bike travel as it is a lighter weight and simple solution to the bike luggage situation. You will have to invest in some decent bike bags ; large saddle pack, frame bag, top tube bags, steam bags, handlebar bar bag. </p>

<h2>Saddlebags</h2>



<p>Saddlebags or saddle packs are a alternative to consider for lighter-weight setups for a day or couple day trips. They still provide storage for gear, but you may need to get lightweight gear, that takes up as small as volume as possible. I am still trying to figure this out for longer tours as I like having two big panniers for all my gear. But it is something to consider. </p>

<h2>Things To Consider When Loading Gear On Your Bike</h2>



<ul><li>Check to see if the rack you intend to get is suited for disc brakes if your bike has them. </li><li>Make sure that the weight of the gear you intend to carry on the rack does not exceed the racks load limit. Most high end racks are built to carry heavy loads. However the cheaper alternatives generally will only be able to carry lesser weight. </li><li>Check to see if your rack is compatible with your panniers. </li></ul>



<h2>Pannier options</h2>
