<p>Maybe you want to get a backpack for bikepacking instead of bikpacking bag. When I talk to bikepacking enthusiast they always say get bikepacking bags compared to using a bikepacking backpack. But considering that backpack are a good solution when it comes to bikepacking if you do it the right way. </p>



<p>If you pack gear in the backpack is fairly lightweight, like a windbreaker, water in a camel back for example. Then it allows some extra space if needed for storing more food when you stock up and you will be using it up and the backpack will get lighter. Some don&#8217;t like them as they can result in a sweaty backs or back issues. Some bags a well ventilated that they can reduce this. I believe they key is to pack them with really light weight gear that would otherwise take up space in bikepacking bags. You can use a backpack to add additional store to a all ready well tuned bikepacking bike bag setup. </p>



<p>The one thing to consider if you are going to select a compressible backpack is that most of them are not that comfortable when it comes to packing items that are not soft and you will most likely feel it stab into your back. </p>



<p>Then there is hip packs or also known as fanny packs that can be used as an additional storage option if you don&#8217;t want to use a backpack. These are great for storing a camera and personal items like money and passport. That will always be on you and all times and easy to access while riding. </p>



<p>Depending on how your bike is setup you could store a backpack on the rear rack of your bike and fasten it down with <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bike-rear-rack-straps-attaching-stuff-to-your-bike/">bike rear rack straps!</a> I wrote a article all about <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bike-rear-rack-straps-attaching-stuff-to-your-bike/">attaching stuff to your bike</a>. Some bags would work well to be just permanently attached to the top of the rear rack and then if you need to go on a hike or walk you can take the bag of when needed. This especially works well when the backpack is not like a compressible pack and does not pack that small. I know I titled this article about bikepacking, but these compressible backpacks could come in handy when bike touring too. As they pack rather small into a pannier. I have had this problem personally myself with a backpack. I would store it in my pannier and it would take up the entire space inside the pannier. At least these bags pack so much smaller. </p>

<p>Lightweight backpacks are ideal for bikepacking. Even ultralight weight trail running backpacks are a great option. As they are designed for running and need to be positioned on the body in a way that they don&#8217;t more around too much while running. All the backpacks below are some good options that are recommended and are worth looking into further. The best bikepacking backpacks allow for your to stow them away into something as small as a jersey pocket or into a bike bag taking up very little space when not in use. Such compressible packs will be included down below. </p>



<p>The choice you have to make if you are sold on the idea of getting a backpack for bikepacking or bike touring. Is if you should get a fully-featured backpack that you will constantly wear or a packable one, both have their advantages and disadvantages! </p>

The low rider pack is designed to lower the centre of gravity of the packs overall fit on the body. Providing more stability on bumpy trails and lets your upper body move more freely.

<p>Not really a backpack but Ultra Marathon Hydration Vests by Ultimate Direction could be a great bikepacking storage solution for on the body. They are designed for runners, meaning that they are comfortable to wear when running. Running is much more demanding then riding a bike. In theory I cannot see why they wouldn&#8217;t work for a bikepacking adventure. </p>



<p>It is a featherweight vest at 8.1 ounces or 230 grams and carries ample gear with a minimalist feel. 7+ exterior pockets and ample storage for up to 10L+ of capacity. <strong><a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F128578%2Fultimate-direction-ultra-hydration-vest-40">Priced at $129.95 on REI.com</a></strong></p>



<h3>Osprey Ultralight Stuff Pack</h3>

<p>A bag like this Osprey backpack is great for when you go bike touring. Allowing you to have a day bag for non-bike related activities. It is a very good bag, that comes with a very good guarantee as well. Osprey make some great products, their backpacks come with a heap of features. Also they have a lifetime repair or replacement warranty regardless of the cause of the damage. This Ultralight Stuff Pack only costs $34.95. Don&#8217;t take my work for it you should head over to Amazon and check out the reviews for yourself. It is the perfect option to carry along with you and when you need that extra space for carting food it does a great job at accomodating, but not recommended for all time use as a backpack while riding. </p>



<h3>Sea To Summit Ultra-Sil Daypack</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-27.jpeg?resize=370%2C364&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4044" width="370" height="364" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-27.jpeg?w=480&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-27.jpeg?resize=300%2C295&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-27.jpeg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Sea To Summit is the direct competitor to the above Osprey Stuff Pack, but this Sea To Summit is cheaper at $32.95. I should have mentioned the Osprey is a 18L and this backpack is a 20L in comparison. But they both pack smaller then a fist. </p>
