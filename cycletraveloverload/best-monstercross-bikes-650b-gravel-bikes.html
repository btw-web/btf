<p>Monstercross bikes are a do-it-all bike with dirt drops that has nice wide and supple tires. All these bikes listed down below make some really good bikes for a off the beaten path adventure. These bikes are built to house a min of 2.1&#8243; tires and the 650b combination means you can get a wider tire then some 700c options. The 650B gravel tires are wider and also allows riders to use lower tire pressure, increasing the handling of the&nbsp;bike&nbsp;off road. While these bikes are capable on asphalt, the&nbsp;650B gravel bikes&nbsp;really shine in serious off road situations like tight mountain&nbsp;bike&nbsp;trails and rough sections of&nbsp;gravel adventure&nbsp;rides or races. </p>



<h3>What is a Monstercross bike?</h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s first dive into what really categories a monstercross bike or monster gravel bike. Some describe them as a bike the perfect all rounder bike that fits somewhere between a cyclocross bike and 29er mountain bike. And you don&#8217;t have to go out and build your own. Today there is more and more bikes which are hitting the market as more riders from the rod or mountain bike end of the spectrums wish to dive into their counterparts riding disciplines. Roadies wanting to hit the trail and explore off the pavement and mountain bikers wanting the efficiency or speed similar to a road bike but still with the ability to ride the dirt. The monstercross bike is the perfect balance between these two worlds. </p>



<p>Also know as monster gravel bikes. Reason being majority of gravel bikes can be limited when it comes to tire clearance with the option to really only run up to 40 to 45mm tires. But these bikes all have decent tire clearance for riding the rougher stuff and tasking you further on your adventures. </p>



<p>These are my personal favourites, as the writer for Cycle travel Overload, I have a huge passion for adventure bikes and gravel bikes. If I had unlimited space in my apartment to store all these bikes I would own them all. </p>

<p>One of the things that stands out to me about the Gorilla Monsoon bikes is how bloody nice they look. The two tone is so good. I personally like the orange and yellow tone model. But this is an ultimate 650B Monstercross bike! It is their dirt do-it all solution. A sweet beast designed to handle on- or off-road shredding, bikecamping, short-duration dirt touring, and the pursuit of good times! </p>



<p>An all steel build with 612 Select CroMoly steel frame and 4130 CroMoly tapered forks. It features a stealth dropper post routing near the bottom bracket. Along with the SRAM Apex 1 groupset with a FSA Comet 1x, Direct Mount 36t Ring and Sunrace 11spd, 11-42t cassette. It is a strong and capable monster for hilly trails out in the middle of nowhere. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FAll-City-MY19-Gorilla-Monsoon-Bike-Apex%3Favad%3D256925_b1a01e80d">Price is $2,099 at Tree For Bikes</a>.

<h2>Ibis Hakka MX</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="472" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIR.jpg?resize=720%2C472&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5164" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIR.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIR.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIR.jpg?resize=768%2C503&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FIR.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Ibis Hakka MX is a dreamy bike that I also love! Did I mention? These are my dream bikes! A all carbon build, meaning a lightweight 650B gravel bike compared to a heavier Gorilla Monsoon. The Hakka is Ibis answer to the &#8220;Swiss Army Knife&#8221;. A versatile bike that can do it! If you are after a more detailed review, we have one <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ibis-hakka-mx-review-ultralight-bikepacking-bike/">here</a>. The frame is under 1000 grams meaning you could use this bike from the likes of the morning group sesh to bikepacking across the country!</p>



<p>You can run 700c wheels if you desire, the Hakka has a frame clear­ance for up to&nbsp;700&nbsp;x&nbsp;40c or&nbsp;27.5&nbsp;x&nbsp;2.1” tires. Available in coal, bone white/teal or fire ball read. The red is my kind of rig! The Rival 650B option comes in at <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fibis-hakka-mx-disc-650b-rival-complete-gravel-bike%3Fskid%3DIBSB05X-BONWHITEA-S49C%26ti%3DU2VhcmNoIFJlc3VsdHM6SWJpcyBIYWtrYSBNWCBEaXNjIDY1MGIgUml2YWwgR3JhdmVsIEJpa2U6MToxOkliaXMgSGFra2EgTVggRGlzYyA2NTBiIFJpdmFsIEdyYXZlbCBCaWtl">$3,399 at Back Country</a>. This build features the Praxis Zayante Alloy, 30mm spindle, 40t crank with SRAM PG 1130 11-42t cassette. </p>



<h2>Kona Libre</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="439" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/libre.jpg?resize=720%2C439&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5165" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/libre.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/libre.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/libre.jpg?resize=768%2C468&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/libre.jpg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you are after a small saving on a very comparable bike to the Hakka MX you could look further into the Kona Libre. It features a all carbon build with the Shimano Rival 1&#215;11 with the same number of teeth for crank and cassette (different brand for the crank). The Libre has a 40t X-Sync crank and the exact same cassette, the SRAM PG1130 11-42t 11spd. </p>



<p>But there is quite a difference in geometry out of the two. The Libre has a longer reach, chainstay length and overall wheelbase. Therefore you could come to the conclusion that the Hakka would be more snappier and responsive on the rough stuff. The Libre also feature much more versatility when it comes to mounting options. Top tube mounts and more on the forks. It does come with 700c wheels and tires, WTB Riddler TCS 700x45c. The price for this bike starts <a href="https://www.konaworld.com/libre.cfm">from $2999.00</a></p>



<h2>Bearclaw Thunderhawk</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="424" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bearclaw-bikes-oct-201800619-Thunderhawk-new-carbon-fork-Thunder-Burts-1024x654.jpg?resize=720%2C424&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5168" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bearclaw-bikes-oct-201800619-Thunderhawk-new-carbon-fork-Thunder-Burts-1024x654.jpg?resize=1024%2C654&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bearclaw-bikes-oct-201800619-Thunderhawk-new-carbon-fork-Thunder-Burts-1024x654.jpg?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bearclaw-bikes-oct-201800619-Thunderhawk-new-carbon-fork-Thunder-Burts-1024x654.jpg?resize=768%2C452&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bearclaw-bikes-oct-201800619-Thunderhawk-new-carbon-fork-Thunder-Burts-1024x654.jpg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>I am new to being introduced to the Thunderhawk just found out about this bike a few days ago, if you are after a full titanium gravel bike. This is definitely a great option! Just look at this thing it is a weapon of a bike! It is available in two models; the high end Force 1 with Hydraulic Disc brakes and the Rival 1 with Mechanical Disc brakes. For the purpose of this article we are going to include the Rival for comparison sake. Which we included in the comparison document (available for FREE download) just to make it a more even playing field for the other bikes. The Rival option is <a href="https://bearclawbicycleco.com/thunderhawk-titanium-650b-gravel-bike/">priced at $3,890</a> with the Force 1 is $1,800 more at $5,690.</p>



<p>Put in Bearclaw&#8217;s words the &#8220;Thunderhawk lends itself as a&nbsp;performance-minded 650b road plus bike&nbsp;that’s equipped to handle all road adventure rides, mixed-terrain endurance races, gravel grinders, and long bikepacking trips.&#8221;  You get all the rack, fender and other mounting options you could dream of and the bike fits up to&nbsp;a 700x50c (29×1.9″) or 650x60c (27.5×2.35″) tires. </p>



<h2>Salsa Warbird 650B</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="416" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/warbirdforce1650.jpg?resize=720%2C416&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5169" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/warbirdforce1650.jpg?w=970&amp;ssl=1 970w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/warbirdforce1650.jpg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/warbirdforce1650.jpg?resize=768%2C443&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/warbirdforce1650.jpg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>I did say i was going to keep it a &#8220;even playing field&#8221; but I forgot about the Warbird aka The Gravel King! Salsa build this bike in a 650B option with a SRAM Force 1 groupset. Which puts this bike in the high-end component level carbon frame gravel bike category. If you want our take in a review on this bike, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/salsa-warbird-review-gravel-racing-bike-king/">read this article.</a> </p>



<p>The Warbird is able to fit up to 700c x 45mm or 650b x 2.1 inch wheels and tires. it is one of the best gravel bikes for cargo capacity. You also get a more slacker gravel racing geometry, mixed with ergonomically designed brake levers and the frame is 100 grams lighter from the previous Warbird. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FSalsa-2019-Warbird-Carbon-650b-Force-1-Gravel-Bike">All for a price of $3,499 at Tree Fort Bikes</a></p>

<p>Norco now has some 2020 models for your liking; the Search XR S1 650b and the Search XR S2 650b which are amazing bikes. But I have a thing for the 1x groupsets and you can pick up the green 2019 model for 20% off. </p>



<p>I am such a sucker for this bike, I have seen one in the flesh and it screams adventure! So this bike above is the Steel option. Which features a carbon fork and 650B wheels with the SRAM Rival 1 groupset. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=3727a95c-b736-4887-82ff-a1d0ed6654a8&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.norco.com%2Fbikes%2F2019%2Froad%2Fgravel%2Fsearch-xr-steel%2Fsearch-xr-steel-rival-1%2F">Price for this bike is $2,239.00 at Norco</a></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="455" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20_search-xr-c-2_gold-1.png?resize=720%2C455&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5171" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20_search-xr-c-2_gold-1.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20_search-xr-c-2_gold-1.png?resize=300%2C190&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20_search-xr-c-2_gold-1.png?resize=768%2C486&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20_search-xr-c-2_gold-1.png?resize=1024%2C648&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20_search-xr-c-2_gold-1.png?resize=50%2C32&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20_search-xr-c-2_gold-1.png?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Then for the Carbon option they have some nice 2020 models that are both in the 1&#215;11 groupsets but you can choose between the Norco Search XR C2 or Norco Search XR C1. Whats the difference? Well first price the C1 is $1,200 more. But the C1 is a &#8216;full&#8217; carbon bike. By that I mean you get carbon wheels, a carbon crank, and carbon handlebars. But this sees no change in the groupset as they both have the Shimano GRX 800. </p>



<p>In my opinion the Norco Search XR C2 would be my choice, as I don&#8217;t see the value in that much more for carbon parts. And personally I love steel bikes the most anyway. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=3727a95c-b736-4887-82ff-a1d0ed6654a8&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.norco.com%2Fbikes%2F2020%2Froad%2Fgravel%2Fsearch-xr-carbon%2Fsearch-xr-c2%2F">The C2 is priced at $3,799.00</a></p>

Along with bar-end shifters you get that old school touring bike feel. But also so many options to mount gear, look at the forks.</p>
