<p>I am so happy to find out that such a security measure exists for bicycle enthusiasts. It seems as though the most easiest of ways to take advantage of a locked bike. The wheels are often never locked up with the rest of the bike. Say you just spent $1000 <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/complete-list-of-best-gravel-wheelset-for-adventure-cycling-and-bikepacking/">on a gravel wheelset</a>. This could be a potential incentive for a theft to come along and steel them right off your bike. If you are spending this kind of money on wheels then you may want some further security. And this is where locking skewers and bike wheel locks come in and offer that peace of mind. Also other components too might be on your mind and have you a little worried about if they will be stolen when you park out front the library for a couple hours. We have also included some security options for locking your seat post and saddle as well. You can also get these bicycle security bolts which will work for locking down other components on your bike like the saddle, pedals, crankset, handlebar and headset. The security measures are endless and this is very promising and offers a great deal of piece of mind for cyclists.  </p>



<p>if you really wanted to you could just get a long bicycle lock and lock both wheels through. Or use two bike locks. Locking either wheel. But this can get on the bulky side and is not the best solution. These locking options listed in this article below are for one of the main purposes that it is a minimalist approach to locking your bike that does not require extra bulky and heavy bikes locks to be carried everywhere you ride. If you have just purchased a rather expensive bike. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/kona-sutra-ltd-review-bikepacking-bike/">Like me!</a> Then these locking ideas can be a great solution to any worries that you may have. </p>

<p>Quick Caps is a quick release wheel lock that does not require you to replace your entire skewer. Simply put it’s a fit and forget mechanism which discourages thieves from stealing your bike wheels and you carrying less locks. The lock made an appearance on Kick Starter and managed to rase much more then its intended goal. This lock is simple but amazing!! It works by simply sandwiching the quick release wing from either side and locks together. So genius!! They are designed to not in anyway effect they way your bike rides and they only weigh 51 grams each. They are made with strength and durability, there tests show that it takes 900 Nm of force to break the lock.&nbsp; The Quick Caps are made from a single piece of marine grade aluminium which is ideal for outside weather conditions and very light weight. From what I could tell on the Kick starter page this lock does not work with the older quick release skewers that you get on retro bikes from say the 80&#8217;s. Also some users have had troubles getting the lock to fit, so it is best to do some further research to see if it will fit your bikes quick release. </p>

<h3 id="title">Pinhead Bicycle Locking Skewer Set</h3>

<p>On Amazon I found what seems to be one of the better options when it comes to bicycle wheel theft. Available in a 2 pack. It includes a front and rear wheel locking skewer, with each lock operated using a unique multi combination key. They seem like a rather great solution if you live in a big city where theft is unfortunately rather common. I would say they are not the best solution on the market. <a href="https://amzn.to/2vf3J5W">But the reviews on Amazon are rather good</a> <a href="https://amzn.to/2vf3J5W">with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating</a>. </p>



<p>I bought these skewers to prevent my wheels from getting stolen again, and they have done the job! I don&#8217;t take my wheel off ever, so I really had no use for quick release anyway. You can register your serial number so if you lose your key, they can send you a new one. There were previous concerns that there was a tool that could remove these easily, but they now include a washer that prevents that tool from working. The set is priced at <a href="https://amzn.to/2vf3J5W">$42.83 on Amazon</a></p>



<h3>Delta Axlerodz Bolt On Bicycle Skewers</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="444" height="180" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/31T8KSVETDL._AC_.jpg?resize=444%2C180&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4608" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/31T8KSVETDL._AC_.jpg?w=444&amp;ssl=1 444w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/31T8KSVETDL._AC_.jpg?resize=300%2C122&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/31T8KSVETDL._AC_.jpg?resize=50%2C20&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you are after a super budget friendly secure bicycle skewer set then look no further then these Delta Axlerodz skewers. These bolt-on skewers are designed for quick-release wheel hubs. Made from anodized aluminum heads, stainless steel centering springs. They use a 5 millimeter allen key for installation. And weigh in at 69 grams (2.45 ounces). For the priced these costs at <strong>$19.95</strong> for the pair it is a complete bargain. They are rather good for the priced. <a href="https://amzn.to/383W9Kg">Read the reviews if you don&#8217;t believe me. </a></p>



<p>However, some users have mentioned that the decorative &#8220;washer&#8221; on the Allen head side isn&#8217;t sufficiently countersunk to accommodate the chamfer between the head and body of the axel bolt. This causes the bolt head to bind a little, making the teeth of the &#8220;washer&#8221; grind into the dropouts. You can remedy this by deepening the countersinking by hand with a large drill bit. And also the steel insert on the far end of the axel can pull through even if you use a good torque wrench (I used a CDI torque wrench) to ensure 7nm. The insert is largely held in place by an interference fit, which is a bad idea when there is active tension on the insert. Once the insert starts sinking, the nut is useless. I resorted to using the nut from the set of quick release skewers these Axelrodz were intended to replace. </p>

<p>As with the locking skewers other locking systems are also available for seatpost and they also have a complete skewer set which is for wheel and seatpost. They work in exactly the same way as a normal skewer, slide through the hub, make sure it&#8217;s tight and then close the lever. To unlock them, you must invert the bike so it&#8217;s resting on the saddle and bars with the wheel upwards. If your bike is securely locked upright to a post or rack, it cannot be opened and your wheels and saddle cannot be stolen, yet you retain the practicality and ease of use of quick release skewers in the event of a puncture, mechanical problem or need to store or transport your bike with wheels and saddle off. Priced at $28.87 USD</p>
