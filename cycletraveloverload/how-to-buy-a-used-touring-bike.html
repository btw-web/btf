<p>I have always try and get a bargain on everything I buy. For me there was no difference when buying my SURLY LHT. I ended up pay a grand total of $250 for my touring bike. Which has been with me for tours over japan, many places in Australia and in Europe (very soon).</p>



<p>I want to share everything I have learnt from my experience buying a used touring bicycle. If you do it the right way you can save a lot of many, if you were to pay retail. Think about it, I paid $150 for my Surly LHT and they cost $1,350 RRP. That is quite a saving.</p>



<p>Buying used is a good idea if you are getting started into bicycle touring. And you don’t want to spend too much money on this passion to see if you will enjoy it. I have no doubt that you will love it by the way. But you know what I mean.</p>



<p>Depending on where you live it can be more difficult to find great deals on used touring bikes. If you are in the United States there is plenty. Australia where I am from is okay. But other places I am not too sure how established a second hand market is for touring bikes. I would assume UK and European countries would be good too.<br></p>



<h2>Where To Buy?</h2>



<ul><li>eBay</li></ul>



<ul><li>Gumtree or CraigsList</li></ul>



<ul><li>Pawn Shops</li></ul>



<ul><li>Second Dealers</li></ul>



<ul><li>Garage Sales</li></ul>



<ul><li>Facebook Marketplace (this is a great place to find some deals)</li></ul>



<p>Once again depending on your location. If you have access to eBay, Gumtree, CraigLists or any other online e commerce platforms. You changes are high in finding a good deal on a touring bike.</p>



<p>You can shop at Pawn Shops and other second physical store dealers too. Places like Garage sales are gems too. I bought my Surly from a Cash Convertors, which is a National Pawn Shop here in Australia.<br>I want to do a quick experiment. At the time of writing this post. I am going to do some quick searches to see what used touring bikes are available right now. I love this stuff.</p>



<p>Depending on the type and brand of bike that you are most interested. It will depend on what your search term is. You may want to go broad and search for “touring bike”. But some sellers who are listing touring bikes. May not use that keyword in there title and sometimes it will not show up in the search results. So if you want and Surly search for the brand of the bike you want. This will give you more results too look at.</p>



<p>I Am a huge fan of Surly Bikes so I did a search on Gumtree.</p>

<p>Here is a Surly Long Haul Trucker all complete and looks ready to go for $1,200 AUD not bad as they retail for around $2,000 AUD. Finding a great brand, used touring bike. For half of the retail price is about the right price you should expect to pay.<br></p>



<h2>Negotiation</h2>



<p>You can always negotiate on prices from used sellers too. So don’t think you have to pay the asking price. Either send them a offer that is not crazy low but is a realistic number, that fits in your budget. You could get this one for $1,000 who knows.</p>



<h2>Do You Want A Project Or A Complete Bike?</h2>

<p>Most would want a ready to go bike. My Surly was so cheap because I was paying for the frame and that is about it. I like a project and my Surly has been a building progress.</p>



<p>This is what my Surly looked like when I brought it for $220 AUD. As you can see the frame was the only good thing about the bike. But over time I have been able to build it up into a nice touring bicycle.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/making-the-perfect-cup-of-coffee-16.png?fit=720%2C405" alt="" class="wp-image-732" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/making-the-perfect-cup-of-coffee-16.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/making-the-perfect-cup-of-coffee-16.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/making-the-perfect-cup-of-coffee-16.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/making-the-perfect-cup-of-coffee-16.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p>And this is what it currently looks like now.</p>



<p>If you are buying a used touring bike that you want to ride as soon as you buy. I would recommend to look out for these mains things on the bike:<br></p>



<h2>Frame and Fork</h2>



<p>This is the heart of your bike. If the frame and fork fail, then the potential costs to replace would be the same or even more then buying a new bike. So make sure to look over the frame and the body of the bike. To see if there is no dint, scratches or heavy damage to the bike in any way.<br>Before purchasing make sure that the bike is the correct size for you. Get on and have a ride if you must.</p>



<h2>Drivetrain</h2>



<p>Ask the seller how many miles have they rode with the bikes current drivetrain setup. After a few thousand miles you are looking at replacing the cassette and chain. This is not the most costly job, but something to consider before buying a used touring bike.</p>



<h2>Wheels</h2>



<p>Check over the wheels to see if they don’t have any cracks or broken spokes. See if the wheel is true and spins without wobbling from side to side.</p>



<h2>Brakes</h2>



<p>Check the brake pads as they may need replacing which is not a big deal as they are very cheap for new ones. If the bike has disc brakes, make sure to test them and see if they work .</p>



<h2>Tyres</h2>



<p>Check the tyres on the bike also. As you may find that they have a considerable amount of wear and you may encounter flat tyres. Sooner rather then later. So you should also expect the buy some tyres if needed.</p>



<h2>Attachment Points</h2>



<p>This is a given if you are shopping for touring bikes. But to make sure. Look for braze-ons or attachment points for racks.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>This is me having some fun but on Gumtree again as you saw before. I was searching for some Surly Fat Bikes. As these are they type of bikes I want to get next. Planning to do a epic tour of the Canning Stock Route in Western Australia.</p>

<p>So the Surly Pugsley is on my radar.</p>



<p>If you are smart with your money and shop around. You can find deals also on all the new parts that your bike may need before you head off on you bike tour.</p>



<p>Also one more thing, when you are buying a used touring bicycle. And that is that you must expect some other costs after purchasing the bike. In part upgrades. Bikes wear and tear over time. I see this as something that you will have to do when you ride a new bike for a certain amount of time anyway. And is something you should expect. But at the end of the day you are still going to walk about with more money in your pocket. So you could spend that on buying bicycle touring gear.</p>



<p><strong>Extra Tips</strong></p>



<ul><li>If the listing has one photo or the pictures are not that greatest. Or the bike is not clean and not looking presentable. This is your opportunity to down value the bike. But it also sends a message that the person is not attached to the bike as much.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Don’t take it personal when trying to get a cheaper price. It is part of the game. If you are fair enough, you should be able to come to a agreement.</li></ul>



<p>But I wish you all the best in you used touring bike journey.<br>It is the best way to buy not only a bike but anything in general. I am very frugal with my money and like to make every dollar stretch that little bit further.<strong> </strong></p>
