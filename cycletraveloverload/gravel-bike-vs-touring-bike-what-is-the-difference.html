<p>Gravel Bikes are taking the cycling world by storm. Are they a quick trend or are they here to stay? All I know for sure is cyclists from all types of riding styles are flocking to checkout the gravel bike scene. Compared to the  traditional touring bike, what is the difference?</p>



<p>They are both designed with adventure in mind. But a more traditional touring bike is limited with mostly tarmac and pavement riding while the right gravel bike can explore well beyond and still take all your gear with you. </p>



<p>Generally gravel bikes are more suited for light touring and bike adventures. As they are generally not as tough as the traditional touring bikes, with geometries that can vary from something like a road bike (being less comfortable for long days in the saddle) to a touring bike (very upright riding position and extra on bike comfort) and everything in-between. On the other hand touring bikes are dedicated bikes for carry gear specifically on racks with bulky panniers. </p>



<p>Touring bikes generally have a bigger gear range both for climbing and descending. Some gravel bikes are only good on the largest gears and can really lack when it comes to slow, steep climbs. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-value-gravel-bikes/">Making sure you choose the best gravel bike for your adventures is a must!</a> </p>



<h3>Touring Bikes And Gravel Bikes Compared </h3>



<p>When it comes to the physical characteristics of either a gravel bike or touring bike. There are numerous traits that can help you identify them apart. For each paragraph below I mention a new aspect of the bike and what specifically about that part of the bike makes it either a gravel or touring bike. for easier comparison you can compare each paragraph in the touring and gravel bike sections. </p>



<h4>Touring Bikes</h4>



<p>The classic touring bike is almost always made from steel. Making it heavy but very tough and forgiving. In my own opinion steel is my favourite bike material for adventure cycling. </p>



<p>You can expect bar-end shifters for simple maintenance if required on drop bar bikes while some even come with flat bars. </p>



<p>A number of rack, fender mounts and braze-ons built into the frame. Even some touring bikes come with front and rear racks. </p>



<p>Typically they come with 700c wheels but you can also expect 650b and 29&#8243; (which are a MTB 700c wheel and tire). The tire widths can range from <strong>37C to 48C on average</strong>. </p>



<p>The typical touring bike can weigh anywhere from <strong>13kg to 15kg</strong>. With exceptions on either end of this range. But a majority fall into this weight range.</p>



<p>Touring bikes have much larger gear ranges on both the high and low end. Making them more preferred for tackling all types of grades (up and down) easier then gravel bikes. The average gear range for a touring bike is generally <strong>18&#8243; granny gear is great and up to a 120&#8243; high gear</strong> is ideal on a touring bike. </p>



<p>Also touring bikes have more robust components in general compared to gravel bikes. For example touring bikes rims often have <strong>36 spokes</strong> making for a stronger wheel to carry extra gear. </p>



<h4>Gravel Bikes</h4>



<p>Gravel bikes can come in a variety of different materials, from steel to carbon, to titanium or aluminium. To be fair touring bike also can come in alloy, carbon and titanium also but it less common then with gravel bikes. </p>



<p>It is most common for gravel bikes to come with flared drop bars that offer around 6 to 20° + flare in the drops for that extra comfort on more bumpy terrain. Also flat bars can be common for gravel bikes. </p>



<p>Some gravel bikes come with all the rack and fender mounts you will need and even sometimes top tube mounts for integrated bags. But it can be hit and miss, as some gravel bikes don&#8217;t come with any mounts. And it is very unlikely to find gravel bikes for sale with racks. </p>



<p>Gravel bikes come with wider tires in general when compared to touring bikes. It is common to find 700c and 650b wheels, as gravel tires are designed to offer more traction and grip on a range of road conditions. Making them better for handling in the wet, on gravel roads, and other rough roads. Often road bike and most touring bike tires are unable to go with ease. You can expect to find tires from <strong>38c all the way up to 2.3&#8243; or 60mm tires on gravels bikes.</strong> That larger tire volume helps provide extra suppleness and a smoother ride! </p>



<p>The average weight of a gravel bike is anywhere from <strong>9 to 13 kg</strong>! Which is lighter then most touring bikes. This is one of the main reasons of appeal for gravel bikes. They are lighter and allow you to explore the same and even more places then you can on a touring bike. </p>



<p>When it comes to gear range the gravel bike often lacks compared to the touring bike and it is hard to find any with <strong>under 20&#8243; for climbing and they often max out at around 100&#8243;</strong> or less on the highest gear. Because they are most commonly found with 2x or 1x drivetrains while touring bikes are most often 3x!</p>



<p>Gravel bikes have less spokes then touring bikes. On average you can expect around <strong>32 spokes</strong> on gravel bike rims. As they are generally not intended for fully loaded adventures. </p>



<h3>Are gravel bikes good for touring and long distances?</h3>



<p>Yes, If you ride a gravel bike that is adventure ready it can be the perfect bike for your next tour. These bikes often have a stack/reach ratio of over 1.5 and mid length chainstays, around 430 to 445 mm are ideal for a well balanced gravel bike for touring. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-for-touring-6-best-gravel-bikes-for-touring/">Check out these </a><a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=gravel%20touring%20bike">gravel touring bik</a><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-for-touring-6-best-gravel-bikes-for-touring/">es</a> if you are after something that is great for your next tour or long distance bike trip.</p>



<p>But not all gravel bikes are ideal for touring and riding long distances. As some gravel bikes are designed to be similar to cyclocross bikes and road bikes. With speed and aerodynamics at the forefront. They are not made for comfort over the long haul, which is more important to most when touring. </p>



<p>Also some gravel bikes geometries will not be suited for carry large loads of gear. Which is why it is important to see what the specs are of the gravel bike you are looking to potentially purchase. The start of <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-for-touring-6-best-gravel-bikes-for-touring/">this article</a> also explains what you should look out for when selecting a gravel bike for touring. </p>



<p>In conclusion gravel bikes make a really good light touring bike or even steel gravel bikes like these are more then capable to take you on some rad bikepacking adventures without sacrificing any of your camping gear. If you plan to ride only pavement and run panniers and are not worried about riding at a slower pace, touring bikes are still perfect. But gravel bikes can be the perfect all-rounder allowing you to explore places where touring bikes are just not able or ideal. </p>
