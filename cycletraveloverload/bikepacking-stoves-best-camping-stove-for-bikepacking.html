<p>Some bikepackers prefer to keep their kitchen equipment to a minimum and only take a small stove that can boil water. And that is about its only use. This post is dedicated to finding all those camping stove options that are recommended and used by others. Who take them on bikepacking adventures. That are lightweight and can fit in a frame bag or any other bike bag. </p>



<p>Personally I use the traditional Trangia. Which is quiet a large piece of kit that is on the boarder of being way to big for a bikepacking trip. I manage to make it work, as I love cooking with the Trangia it allows me to cook some of my best vegan recipes in very remote locations all over the world. You can read my review here if you are interested to learn more about this camping stove. </p>

<p>When looking for a camping stove for bikepacking. It is a good idea to get something that can use just about any fuel source or at least a fuel that is easily available in the places you will be travelling. In some places in the world some stove fuels are harder to find. Getting a stove that can burn unleaded, kerosene and/or use cartridges might be good for a world tour?&nbsp;A stove that has many fuel applications is ideal. </p>



<p>The packed size is another factor and if it will pack away in your bikepacking bags. Again its capability to be able to cook more advanced meals if you are feeling creative. </p>

<p>It might be a good idea to look into getting a saucepan that will be big enough to fit your appetite. then use Primus or MSR burner, combined with a a wind protection cap&nbsp;depending on the conditions where you plan to travel. </p>



<p>A wood stove might be a better option for a bikepacking stove. As you don&#8217;t need to track down any fuel. Just use the abundance of pencil sized twigs around camp to keep it going. Even cardboard from food packaging makes great tinder. </p>

<p>You might want to consider having a two stove setup for bikepakcing and touring. More so for touring especially on long adventures. It makes camp feel more like home and it is great to use a alcohol stove for cooking and a wood stove to keep water warm or boiled for beverages and cleaning. </p>



<p>So what are your bikepacking camp stove options? In no particular order here they are! These are used by other bikepackers and can be recommended if you are looking for a adequate stove for bikepacking. </p>

<p>Although it is not the best system for cooking some very advanced meals, like one can master with a full sized Trangia. It still is a great cooking system for boiling water, doing so in 100 seconds. You can get the <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F884005%2Fjetboil-pot-support">pot support </a>attachment. Which allows you to cook in a frying pan. Total weight for this system is 13.1 ounces or 371 grams. </p>

<p>Although I highly recommend the original non stick Trangia for cooking some epic meals. Unfortunately it is not the best option for bikepacking and being able to pack away in a small space. However Trangia have caught onto the demands for lightweight and small packing camp stoves. That they do offer the Trangia Triangle which is essentially a Trangia fuel canister with 3 stainless steel sides along with a support ring. Offer a very minimal stove setup, that packs away small with the dimensions of 14cm x 10cm x 1cm and only weighing in at 115 grams. </p>
