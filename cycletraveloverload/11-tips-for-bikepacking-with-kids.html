<p>Just because you have children doesn’t mean your bikepacking adventuring should stop. If anything, sharing these bikepacking experiences with children will enrich them and give them a healthy sense of adventure and understanding of the world around them. But now your kid is too big to fit in your saddlebag, how are you going to take them with you? Their little push along bike might not quite handle the single track! We have had our thinking caps (and helmets) on and have come up with 11 tips to help share your adventures with your little pals.</p>



<h2><strong>Reasons to cycle with children</strong></h2>



<p>Firstly, let’s look at the reasons why you should be taking kids out exploring with you. A blog post by the British Journal of Medicine (BJM) called <a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bjsm/2017/03/30/play-pedals-engaging-preschool-children-cycling-improve-mental-physical-health-future-generations/">‘Play on Pedals’</a> exposes why cycling is so good for kids.</p>



<p>In this day and age it is becoming increasingly difficult to wean the kids away from digital screens. Teaching them to ride a bike or exposing them to the outside world at an early age can form this into a hobby early on to make the screen time naturally lessen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Actually learning to ride a bike builds their bone density, muscles bulk and cardiovascular health. All of this will help maintain a happy healthy child. The balance and coordination needed for riding a bike has obvious developmental benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When riding a bike or being taken out on a ride the child also learns about interacting with their surroundings and learns a sense of independence and accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going out and exploring and planning routes, reading maps and signs is excellent mental health work. This problem solving helps their brains develop, improves mental wellbeing and resilience. Planning a ride together or just having that extra time together (if they’re too young to plan) is excellent bonding time for you and your family. There’s no remotes to fight over and an abundance of new experiences to share with each other.</p>



<h2><strong>Bikepacking with kids</strong></h2>



<p>When bikepacking with kids, it isn’t about smashing out the crazy miles and most exciting terrain. It’s about the experience and learning new skills like map reading and problems solving. It’s about those times around the campfire and learning to set up a tent. Now we have established it’s a great idea, how are you going to take them and how are you going to make it fun? No, we are not putting them in the dog basket!</p>



<ol><li><strong>Trailer</strong> &#8211; If your child is still quite small then a pull along trailer could be an excellent way of bringing them with you. This two seater version from <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Burley-Design-Bike-Trailer-Yellow/dp/B010LLGWKE/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=bike+trailer+kids&amp;qid=1596765934&amp;sr=8-3">Burley</a> means you can pack your kit in it too! You need to stay on fairly sealed roads when using a trailer otherwise the kids will have a very bumpy ride back there!</li><li><strong>Involve them in decision making </strong>&#8211; One of the hardest things with kids is keeping them interested. If they have a significant role in the route planning, where you&#8217;re camping and what activities you’ll be doing then they’re much more likely to stay engaged.</li><li><strong>Let them lead &#8211; </strong>If they feel like you’re cycling away from them all day then this will lead to frustration. If they’ve helped plan the route let them lead you to the destination. Map read together and give them some independence. If they have some responsibility they will enjoy it a lot more.</li><li><strong>Give them some kit to carry &#8211; </strong>Obviously don’t overload them, but giving them their own bar bag with some food or clothes in is a great way to give responsibility to them. This will make them feel important and fully involved. The less passive the trip the better.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Shorter routes &#8211; </strong>Like we said before, these adventures aren’t about how far you can go. Little legs get tired quickly and tired legs get grumpy quickly. You may want to have a plan B ready if the grumpy-tired-legged child doesn’t want to continue.</li><li><strong>Regular stops</strong> &#8211; This breaks up the attention span. Kids can’t concentrate on anything as long as adults even if they’re enjoying it. Plan to stop and do an activity to break the day up. Could you do a bit of rock climbing or bird watching? Is there a castle or a beach you can visit?</li><li><strong>Bring snacks </strong>&#8211; We know you bring snacks anyway but we mean fun snacks! Like marshmallows for the fire or hot chocolate for the stove.</li><li><strong>Online research </strong>&#8211; Kids love screens and colourful fun images. Why not look up a few travel inspiration images of where you’re going beforehand so they can recognise it when you get there? This will keep them looking out for things as you go.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Break up the ride</strong> &#8211; Can you take the ferry or the train on certain sections? Everyone loves ferries and trains and it gives legs a rest whilst still covering some distance.</li><li><strong>Send a postcard &#8211; </strong>Stop off in a town to choose a postcard and get them to write down what they’re loving about the trip and send it home.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Learning to live outside </strong>&#8211; Learning how to make a campfire, use a stove or set up a tent is every kids dream. Seize this opportunity. Maybe get them some books to read on the topic beforehand so they can put what they read into action.</li></ol>



<p>Now, we seem to have made it all sound very easy and enjoyable. However, there will be tantrums and there might be rain but that’s all part of the experience. Good planning and research will help overcome the troubles. Don’t make it too hard they want to give up or too boring they don’t want to do it again. Start off with a weekend trip and extend as you feel able. The bikepacking world is their oyster!</p>
