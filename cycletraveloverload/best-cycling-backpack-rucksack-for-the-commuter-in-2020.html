<p>Here at Cycle Travel Overload we love adventures across countries, powered by nothing more then the energy you exert when pedalling a bicycle! Although backpacks are not considered all that popular with this type of riding. As when bikepacking or bike touring wearing a heavy backpack can cause sweat and pain in your back over the long term. This is why bikepacking bags and panniers are ideal.</p>



<p>However this article is for the commuter! the city slicker looking for a backpack to wear just when cycling into the CBD for work or school or doing the weekly grocery run. </p>



<p>There are many cycling backpack options to choose from. And in this article we are going to share with you some of the most popular cycling backpacks for commuting purposes. </p>



<p>You may even want to consider panniers before deciding on a backpack. As they take the weight of your body and on the bike. However it is best if you ride a touring bike or commuter bike with rear eyelets to accomodate a rear rack to mount the panniers on.</p>



<p>Also these bikes are designed with a longer chainstay length and wheelbase generally. This change in bike geometry stops your heels from hitting the pannier as you pedal. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-bike-panniers-best-panniers-for-touring-commuting-bikepacking/">We recommend you head over and check out the best pannier options if you are interested.</a> </p>



<p>Or why can&#8217;t you have both? What do you mean? you might be asking! It might be a better idea to opt for <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/17-best-convertible-backpack-panniers-in-2019/">backpack panniers</a>. These act as a backpack when you are of the bike or when you just want to roll with a backpack. But convert into a pannier. hiding away the shoulder straps to fit onto a rear rack. And yes you can ride with one pannier on one side of the rear rack. Generally if it is light enough it works. But I have found that the bike is more difficult to manoeuvre when the single pannier is quiet loaded and very heavy. Some of these backpack panniers made the list anyway. </p>



<p>As mentioned in the linked article above. If you have Ortlieb panniers you can use <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F798959%2Fortlieb-panniers-carrying-system">this item</a> to turn the pannier into a backpack!</p>



<p>When looking at a backpack for cycling you want something that is going to offer comfort when wearing on your back and shoulder area. Due to the obvious. When riding you already are putting more strain on your body in a bent over position and the added weight of a backpack and its contents can hurt your back over the long term. A backpack with extra padding in these areas is a good trait. </p>



<p>This also means that a backpack with chest and hip straps is going to offer extra comfort. Taking some of the weight from the strain around your shoulders. And distributing the weight more evenly. Also stopping the backpack from more side to side while riding. Some womens backpacks even have more adjustability to accomodate for fitting under or over the bust area instead of directly over the top. </p>



<p>What type of gear do you typically take with you when commuting? This is something you need to know. If you always take your laptop with you to work in a coffee shop. most but not all cycling backpacks will have a padded compartment area to house a laptop. If you work somewhere where you need to carry a change of clothes like formal wear you will also need a backpack with a large opened storage area. If however you only take a few small things with you regularly then you should be able to get away with a smaller volume backpack. </p>



<p>If you only pack very limited gear like a wallet, phone and keys for example <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-bikepacking-backpacks-hip-packs-fanny-packs/">you might be able to get away with a waistpack</a>. (also this linked article has some ultralight weight day pack options. That pack away to nothing if you like bikepacking and want a minimal backpack for when off the bike. But also want it to pack away, taking up very little volume.)</p>



<p>Plus these hip packs look hip! These are getting much more popular in bikepacking for carrying just important small things on your body when travelling like passport. But they would work just as well for a minimalist cycling commuter. </p>



<p>Waterproofing is also idea. But not as common with most backpacks. But if you can find one that is waterproof rather then water resistant this might be a good choice. If you get caught out in the rain while commuting you want to keep your valuables dry and safe. But typically when commuting you re not going to continue to ride in a downpour. Therefore it is conceivable to consider water resistant backpacks as you only need it to briefly keep your gear dry while you seek shelter. Ideally you want a backpack that has at least some deal of waterproofing just incase. </p>



<p>Also when it comes to organisation. There is a backpack for most. If you like just throwing all your stuff into one single compartment and digging through then there is backpacks for that. And also if you rather be super efficient and organised. Putting everything in there little compartments then there is backpacks that are catered to the very organised one. </p>



<p>Ideally the best cycling backpack should have optimal breathability. With channels that run along the back and straps to circulate air flow and allow sweat to whisk away and not build up and cause nasty sweat patches. </p>



<p>Also something to consider is getting a backpack that offers visibility and reflection components to the design. This is just for that extra safety and visibility when riding particularly at night. </p>



<p>Keep in mind that you are most likely not going to find a backpack that fits all these criteria. But it is worth deciding which are most important to you and choose a cycling backpack that specialises in those certain traits. This brings me onto the next point. Some cycling backpacks will have hydration systems installed in the bag. If you have no water bottle cage mounts or plan on commuting longer distances that require you to keep your hydrations up these backpacks are a contending solution. Allowing you to drink directly from a tub that runs out of the bag to your mouth. </p>



<p>Keep in mind that these bags are in no particular order of which is the &#8220;best&#8221; as the best is subjective to your own personal needs and matching the backpack to those needs. </p>

<h3>Ortlieb&nbsp;Commuter Daypack City</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6ac1bc21-fdd4-4206-812e-bd479baf1c3c.jpeg?resize=375%2C544&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5619" width="375" height="544" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6ac1bc21-fdd4-4206-812e-bd479baf1c3c.jpeg?w=405&amp;ssl=1 405w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6ac1bc21-fdd4-4206-812e-bd479baf1c3c.jpeg?resize=207%2C300&amp;ssl=1 207w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6ac1bc21-fdd4-4206-812e-bd479baf1c3c.jpeg?resize=34%2C50&amp;ssl=1 34w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>One of the more stylish backpacks here, by Ortlieb you know you are getting durability and waterproof construction. The cycling backpack has 1 front pocket (not waterproof); organizer with inner pockets; padded sleeve for notebook/tablet. With a roll-top closure with strap and adjustable alloy hook make for quick access. When it comes to airflow you get ventilated shoulder straps and a back panel which has ventilation channels. Removable waist and sternum straps. And loops for U-lock, helmet and blinking light. Weigh comes in at 1 lb and 10.8 oz or 759 grams. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F102314%2Fortlieb-commuter-daypack-city">Priced at $175.00</a> A few things to pick on this backpack is the vertical orientation of the zipper is not ideal. The vertical slit makes it more cumbersome to deposit items into. The three colors the bag is available in are all dark, and it lacks big reflective patches that Ortlieb are famous for on their panniers. It has nothing apart from the small Ortlieb logo (2&#8243; across) located at bottom right. </p>

<p>The roll top closer design is rather popular with commuter cycling backpacks. But what can I say I really like this style! The main selling point of the Chrome Blckchrm is the versatile contraction. The technical sailcloth material with a 22° bias that resists tearing. Is what it&#8217;s all about. Plus the number of nifty little pockets, like for the quick access phone pocket near the lower back area on the backpack. With waterproof zipper. The waterproofing is enhanced with the removable seam-taped waterproof tote liner.
