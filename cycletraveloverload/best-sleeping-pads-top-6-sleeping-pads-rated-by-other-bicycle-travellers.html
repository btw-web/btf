<p>This sleeping pad seems to be one of the favourites with other bicycle travellers. It packs small, easy to carry in bike bags and/or panniers. One bike camper, who suffers with back issues. Stated that &#8220;I sleep better on this Thermarest mat then in my own specialised bed. Highly recommended!&#8221;</p>



<p>Something to consider is that when the NeoAir is fully inflated it is quite hard. This is remedied by deflating it to about 25% to get a softer feel, which works well. </p>

<p>Similar to the one above but also includes a layer that reflects your heat. making it so much warmer. </p>



<p>Note that both these pads, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PZKTPVK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vegancodey-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00PZKTPVK&amp;linkId=64f0b782dcf82706c0794bf408ae9d2c">NeoAir XTherm </a>and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PZL14EK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vegancodey-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00PZL14EK&amp;linkId=407f1167d494702e4badb9f300fa60ce">NeoAir Xlite</a> are noisy pads if you under-inflate them. Which may be something to consider as most bike campers end up doing so to get exactly the most preferred level of comfort. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PZKTPVK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vegancodey-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00PZKTPVK&amp;linkId=64f0b782dcf82706c0794bf408ae9d2c">Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm Ultralight</a> is the ideal winter sleeping pad. I is heavier then the previous pad due to being made form thicker and more durable materials.</p>

<p>A comfortable, warm, and light weight sleeping pad. These Insulted pads seem to be the way to go when you are cycling colder climates. You never feel cold from the ground and the inflation sack works great once you are used to it! </p>



<p>If your sleeping bag is pushed to its rating limit. The mat can help add that addition warmth, so you are not freezing. </p>



<p>One of the setbacks some experience for over a year of use, the down comes out noticeably. </p>



<p>However this newer model has some additional upgrades compared to the older model.</p>



<ul><li>The new flat valves are much better than the old rotating valves. Including separate inflation and deflation valves. These seem less prone to breaking. </li><li>the new Schnozzel Pumpbag allows you to pump up the pad much quicker then before only taking 2 cycles compared to 10 which is much faster.</li><li>The repair kit included has a small storage pouch attached to the storage bag. Including the patches, a tube of adhesive and instructions. </li></ul>



<p>It is also great to know that Exped&#8217;s customer service is exceptional, and they completely stand behind their product.</p>

<p>This Sleeping pad is one of the most comfortable in the list. Firm enough that your body does not touch to ground as you lay on your side. Quit light and Fits well in its stuff sack. </p>



<p>As this pad is foam filled, the warmth from the insulation can be instantly felt immediately.</p>



<p>It can be inflated rather hard, providing some of the best support in a mat. It has a stiffer feel than most pads, would be more preferred compared to other soft and squishy pads. </p>

<p>Right off the bad this is a more interesting pattern to most pads. Also a bargain in price compared to most other sleeping pads. While also offering warmth and comfort. It is relatively light but it is also around $100 cheaper then most other sleeping pads that are very lightweight. Also packs down very small. </p>



<p>One of the downside to this sleeping pad is the poor valve design/quality, you may have to do a DIY fix job. Klymit has a known problem with their valves. Many of them leak slowly when in use. They have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kkLMmIwzFQ">youtube video</a> on how to fix it, which is not hard, but is also not something you should have to do when buying a new pad. </p>



<p>If you are wanting to know how to do a quick fix on these pads. You will have to pull the valve out (slightly difficult to do), apply strong super glue (like <a href="https://amzn.to/2TxG8ZS">gorilla glue</a>) and press it back in and it so be fixed. After doing this fix if required these sleeping pads are perfect. </p>

<p>A very cool and super bright sleeping pad. That is well built, comfortable and a very lightweight choice. The double-wide pad is huge, with heaps of room if you are over 6 foot. And is the best camping mattress for couples if you get the double-wide option. </p>



<p>Some of the things to consider about the sleeping pad is the price, it is fairly expensive and also comes with no pump. It takes like 60 big breaths to blow up. I am not sure about you but that sounds like a nice warm down workout from a day of pedalling, haha. </p>
