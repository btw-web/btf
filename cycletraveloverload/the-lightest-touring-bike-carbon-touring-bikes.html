<p>If you know anything about touring bikes. It is that they are considerably heavy when compared to other bikes like most gravel bikes. Which are merging the line between road riding and adventure riding! </p>



<p>However a more traditional touring bike is made to be so robust that it can stand up to anything you through its way. Meaning carrying all the gear and supplies needed to tour around the world. This extra load results in a stronger bike and built from stronger materials which results in an overall heavier bike. For example, most touring bikes are made from steel and have racks to hold panniers. </p>



<p>In this article we are going to take a look at some of the lightest touring bikes available. Not to be confused with &#8220;light&#8221; touring bikes. This types of touring bike is built to carry less of a load than a full fledged touring bike. Having that said a majority of these bikes are more suited to &#8220;light&#8221; touring. </p>



<p>Generally speaking if you plan to go on an around the world voyage, you actually want a bike that is more suited to riding around the world with all your extra gear. And these bikes are heavier. </p>



<p>But the lightest Touring Bike goes to the Salsa Warbird, at a whopping 18.2 lb or 8.26 kg for the top of the line model priced at $6,999. </p>



<p>If you want to find out more details for all the other carbon touring bikes I have a list below. Also some great budget options if you want to save some cash! </p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Lightest Carbon Touring Bike</h2>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Salsa Warbird</h3>

<p>The Salsa Warbird takes the cake for lightest touring bike in this list. But it comes at a cost! Salsa&#8217;s fully specced out, top of the line Warbird weighs in at 18.2 lb or 8.26 kg and priced at $6,999</p>



<p>With the base model at 9.12 kg or 20.1 lb. But if cutting weight is what you&#8217;re only after, checkout the Salsa Warbird Carbon AXS Wide model. The bike is ideal for gravel racing, but would also make a perfect fast touring bike. With rear rack capabilities thanks to the Salsa Wanderlust Rack and Salsa Rack-Lock Seat Collar.  </p>



<p>However just incase you have some questions. We have answered some of the most common queries. </p>



<h3>What is a good weight for a touring bike?</h3>



<p>Touring bikes on average weigh between 26 to 33 lbs or 12 to 15 kg. Including racks and fenders. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/touring-bike-and-gear-weight-bicycle-tour-packing-tips/">In this article</a> I surveyed bikepackers and bicycle tourers to find the average weight of their bikes with gear. </p>



<p>However the bikes in this list range from the lightest at 18.2 lbs or 8.26 kg to 26.2 lbs or 11.9 kg. Which still weighs less than most &#8216;normal&#8217; touring bikes. </p>



<h3>How much does weight slow you down on a bike? Does a heavy bike slow you down?</h3>



<p>A heavy bike doesn&#8217;t slow you down us much as you might think. Aerodynamics is said to be the most important factor when it comes to cycling efficiency. Which is why bikepacking is becoming more popular these days. Allowing for gear to be store don your bike in a more slipstream manner. Appose to touring bike panniers which can block more of the wind acting like sails slowing you down.</p>



<p>It is why I personally like steel bikes for adventure riding. Yes they weight a little more than carbon bikes. Say 3 to 4 kg more. But they are built to with-stand all the gear load you can imagine. And are overall better designed for bike adventures. </p>



<p>But yes the heavier the bike the more it will slow you down. But it is actually not as much as some might seem. Only if you are racing is where it would make sense to consider a lighter bike. Not really as much for touring. </p>



<p>Now that is out of the way. Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the lightest touring bikes. </p>



<p>The criterial for choosing these bikes was lightweight (obviously), upright and comfortable riding positioning, mounting options on the frame for racks, fenders even kickstands, large gearing ranges and ratios, more robust components and more readily available parts (from around the world). Long chainstays for weight distribution, and for providing clearance between panniers and the rider&#8217;s heels, higher trail than traditional road bikes for loaded stability, </p>



<p><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-vs-touring-bike-what-is-the-difference/">This article</a> goes into further detail about what makes a good touring bike. And compares them to gravel bikes, if you are potentially looking into gravel grinding. </p>



<p>Just quick, more adventure ready gravel bikes can make a great option and often some of these carbon touring bikes share similar DNA to them. However these types of gravel bikes are more suited to bikepacking, which might mean leaving those panniers at home. </p>



<p>But if you are looking to explore with panniers then these carbon touring bikes have the geometry to accommodate and avoid negatively impacting ride handling. Which if you don&#8217;t choose the correct gravel bike. It can be a big mistake. </p>

<p>The cheapest Carbon Touring bike in the list goes to the Haanjo 5C EXP by Diamondback. Priced at $2,000 and weighing in at 21.8 lb or 9.88 kg. It is about 1.62 kg heavier than the lightest bike listed. But 3.5 times cheaper! </p>



<p>Available with 650b x 47c tires, mechanical disc brakes and mid ranged components. Fairly upright with around 1.54 stack/reach, mid range (430mm medium) chainstay, and 75.5 trail. Its bar-end shifters give it that touring bike feel. Making for ease on-trail and tour maintenance. The Shimano 3&#215;9 drivetrain offers huge gear ranges compared to most other 1x gravel options in this list. They also offer their 7C bike which costs more. </p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">(Most Capable Carbon Touring Bike &#8211; Heaviest Bike Overall)</h2>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Salsa Fargo Carbon</h3>

<p>The Salsa Fargo is a truely capable adventure / touring bike. Ideal for trail riding and dirt road touring. Coming with 29&#8243; x 2.6&#8243; Maxxis Ikon tires. It has those wide enough tire to truely take you just about anywhere. With a super upright stack/reach, long chainstay and large trail, all purpose built to be ridden under a load. It is however the heaviest carbon touring bike in this list. </p>

<p>Because weight seems to be the most important reason you would choose a carbon touring bike over a steel rig. We have included a top 5 feature of the lightest carbon touring bikes. </p>



<p>The Giant Revolt takes 2nd place with the Advanced Pro 0 model, weighing 18.3 lb or 8.3 kg and priced at $6,150. Yeah it is not quite as light as the Warbird but cheaper. Both bikes have the same tire clearance for 700c x 45c. Revolt with less mounting options. Looking at the table above, the Revolt is slightly less upright than the Warbird and shorter at the chainstay by 5mm (for a medium frame). Which puts the Revolt in that shorter side and Warbird Mid range. But both would still feel rather quick in the rear. With rather similar trails, in that high and stable range. </p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">3rd Lightest Carbon Touring Bike (Also Lightest/Cheapest Bike)</h2>
