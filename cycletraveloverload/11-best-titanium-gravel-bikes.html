<p>Put in Bearclaw’s words the “Thunderhawk lends itself as a&nbsp;performance-minded 650b road plus bike&nbsp;that’s equipped to handle all road adventure rides, mixed-terrain endurance races, gravel grinders, and long bikepacking trips.” You get all the rack, fender and other mounting options you could dream of and the bike fits up to&nbsp;a 700x50c (29×1.9″) or 650x60c (27.5×2.35″) tires.</p>

<p>I am a fan of the Genesis gravel bike line. That is no different to their De Fer Ti. Providing a still and efficient platform made from double-butted Titanium. They have kept the mudguard eyelets, rear rack mounts and generous tyre clearances. Offering a all round capable bike for any adventure you may have planned. <a href="https://www.genesisbikes.co.uk/bike/croix-de-fer-ti">Priced from £3699.99</a></p>
