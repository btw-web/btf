<p>This blog is mostly all about tips, tricks and information all about traveling to the most stunning corners of the globe by bicycle! Touching on the best bikes to how to guides about bikepacking and touring. This article is a little different! During the writing of this post I am locked down with the Coronavirus and I thought what better time then to create a resource that would help others to organise their garage to store their bikes much more efficiently and well ordered. </p>



<p>These racks are great for saving space in your garage if you are like me and have a ever growing collection of bikes, you know it can get hectic at times with bikes scattered everywhere and they can be a tangling tripping hazard. These solutions just make for easy access to your bikes and other things in your garage. A clear and clean garage means a clear mind!</p>



<p>There are a number of different ways to store your bike inside! We are going to cover all the different methods and I will suggest recommended bike racks and mounts for each category. </p>



<h2>Bike Storage Rack Wall Mounted</h2>



<p>Mounting your bike on the garage wall is one of the most common and best space saving ways to store your bikes. There are two main ways to store your bike on the wall. With either vertical mounts or horizontal. I personally recommend a horizontal wall mount. As this allows many options to store bikes in the garage. If you have hydraulic disc brakes it is beneficial to store horizontal compared to vertical. As vertical can result in the brakes leaking. </p>



<h3 style="text-align:center" id="title">Feedback Sports Velo Wall 2D Rack</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="720" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/71EB-cdrppL._AC_SL1100_.jpg?resize=720%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5206" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/71EB-cdrppL._AC_SL1100_.jpg?w=1100&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/71EB-cdrppL._AC_SL1100_.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/71EB-cdrppL._AC_SL1100_.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/71EB-cdrppL._AC_SL1100_.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/71EB-cdrppL._AC_SL1100_.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/71EB-cdrppL._AC_SL1100_.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>So starting with horizontal bike wall storage racks, this Feedback Sports Rack allows you to move the bike closer to the wall. the independent arms adjust in 2 dimensions. The rack screws into any standard wall stud. This rack is adjustable, meaning the cradles move independently in vertical and horizontal directions. The cradle arms are made from the most soft cradle material they could develop, to prevent scratches to your frame. This is a more premium and elegant designed rack. <a href="https://amzn.to/3bBvsOm">Priced at $38.69 on Amazon</a></p>



<h3 style="text-align:center">Bike Wall Mount Rack Storage Hanger</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="352" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61nbGTuhzhL._AC_SL1500_-1.jpg?resize=720%2C352&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5208" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61nbGTuhzhL._AC_SL1500_-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61nbGTuhzhL._AC_SL1500_-1.jpg?resize=300%2C147&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61nbGTuhzhL._AC_SL1500_-1.jpg?resize=768%2C375&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61nbGTuhzhL._AC_SL1500_-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C500&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61nbGTuhzhL._AC_SL1500_-1.jpg?resize=50%2C24&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61nbGTuhzhL._AC_SL1500_-1.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>A generic bike wall mount hanger these are rather common and can be found in your local shops. but if you have a hard time with availability you can <a href="https://amzn.to/2UTo0r3">shop over at Amazon for this exact one for $15.99</a>. It has a lot of reviews. Maybe not the best product out there but for the price it is rather good. It features a strong solid steel construction with a load capacity up to 44 pounds or 19.95 kg. Suitable for most kinds of bikes, although some people had trouble using it with step over womens bikes. Made from a rubber coating which ensures no scratching. and as a bonus it folds upwards when not in use. </p>



<h3 style="text-align:center" id="title">Steadyrack Classic Bike Rack</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="720" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61LEKpFLJfL._AC_SL1000_.jpg?resize=720%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5209" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61LEKpFLJfL._AC_SL1000_.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61LEKpFLJfL._AC_SL1000_.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61LEKpFLJfL._AC_SL1000_.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61LEKpFLJfL._AC_SL1000_.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61LEKpFLJfL._AC_SL1000_.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Now we move on to the vertical bike storage racks and mounts. Again please note that I don&#8217;t recommend these for bikes with hydraulic disc brakes. The Steadyrack Classic has over 600 ratings on amazon and a 4.8 out of 5 star rating and <a href="https://amzn.to/2ymJSU1">priced at $69.99. I highly suggest you don&#8217;t take my word for it have a look for yourself</a>. This rack is suitable for road, hybrid and select mountain bikes with tire diameters 20” to 29” and widths up to 2.4”. It has a maximum recommended weight  of 35 kg. </p>



<h3 style="text-align:center" id="title">Delta Cycle Leonardo Da Vinci Bike Rack </h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/81JyuacF7L._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=496%2C786&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5210" width="496" height="786" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/81JyuacF7L._AC_SL1500_.jpg?w=946&amp;ssl=1 946w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/81JyuacF7L._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=189%2C300&amp;ssl=1 189w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/81JyuacF7L._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C1218&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/81JyuacF7L._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=646%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 646w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/81JyuacF7L._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=32%2C50&amp;ssl=1 32w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The other vertical bike rack option I have for you is a more minimalist designed then the last. <strong>Perfect if you are looking for something super budget friendly.</strong> Again this rack attaches to the bikes wheels for easy store. With a modern design, the storage hooks look good on the wall even without the bike. No assembly required, easy installation to wall. It says it fits all wheel sizes but not sure if that is true with bikes like a fat bike. (also more on racks suitable to fat bikes later). And a maximum load of 40 pounds or 18.14 kg. <a href="https://amzn.to/3aESyng">Rack is priced at $15.79 at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Ceiling Bike Storage</h2>



<p>Ceiling bike storage racks are perfect for keeping your bikes out of the way! There are a couple good options that allow for such storage. The first hangs your bikes upside down by the wheels. And if you don&#8217;t want your bike upside down there is also a hoist system bike storage option too. </p>



<h3 style="text-align:center" id="title">Saris Glide Bike Storage Rack</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="488" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/s-l640.jpg?resize=640%2C488&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5211" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/s-l640.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/s-l640.jpg?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/s-l640.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Saris bike storage rack is a heavy duty option that can hold up to four bikes and you can buy 2 bike add-on extended piece to make it bigger. One cool thing about it is that it is made with 100% recyclable, non-rusting materials. The suspension hooks adjust to the bicycle wheelbase automatically. You also get the room between bikes to access each bike. Weight capacity for 50 pounds per bike. Or 22.6 kg per bike. <a href="https://amzn.to/2WX2S5Y">Priced at $244.99 at Amazon.</a></p>

<h2>Common Questions:</h2>



<h3>Is it OK to hang bike upside down?</h3>



<p>Depending on the type of bike you have and most commonly the type of brakes. Hydraulic disc brakes don&#8217;t benefit from the bike being upside down for to long. As this can effect the brakes and make them leak. </p>



<h3>Are bike hooks bad for bikes?</h3>



<p>Generally no! If you can get a rack that has adequate rubber or similar material padding on the contact areas of the bike. You should be fine and not expect any damage to your bike. </p>
