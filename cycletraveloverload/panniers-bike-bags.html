<p>There are a variety of different types of bike bags suited specifically for bikepacking, that are on the market today. I will show you all the bags I am currently using on my Surly setup at the moment. </p>



<p>Just quickly here are the type of bags and panniers I have used over the last 3,000 KM +</p>



<ul><li>Handlebar bag</li><li>Stem / Snack Bags</li><li>Top Tube Bag</li><li>Frame Bag</li><li>Rear Panniers</li></ul>



<h2>Handlebar Bags</h2>



<p>For a long time I was also using the <strong>Bell Bike Handlebar Road Stash Bag</strong>. A very affordable handlebar bag, that served me very well for a couple of long tours. It definitely outlived what I expected it to. The zip, ended up breaking and was deemed useless. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="355" height="280" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/41HKz0rd6nL._SX355_.jpg?resize=355%2C280" alt="" class="wp-image-830" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/41HKz0rd6nL._SX355_.jpg?w=355&amp;ssl=1 355w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/41HKz0rd6nL._SX355_.jpg?resize=300%2C237&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Since then, I have also used another handlebar bag. </p>



<p>The <strong>Mainstream MSX CLS 55 Avantgarde MX</strong>. Which is a great waterproof bag that is similar to the <strong>Ortlieb Ultimate Classic 6 Handlebar Bag</strong>. That I will be talking about later. </p>



<h2><strong>Other Handlebar Bags I Am Considering</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Rando Bags</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="720" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rando_bag5_1024x1024.jpg?resize=720%2C720" alt="" class="wp-image-851" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rando_bag5_1024x1024.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rando_bag5_1024x1024.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rando_bag5_1024x1024.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Rando_bag5_1024x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>I love the idea of Rando bags or Randonneur bags. Very large sized bags allowing you store quiet a lot of gear. Above is the <strong>Rando Restrap Bag</strong>. </p>



<p>The thing to consider with this bags setup. Is the addition rack system that will need to be installed on your bike to support the bag.  </p>



<p><strong>Bikepacking style handlebar bags</strong></p>



<p>There are about three bikepacking handlebar bags that I am currently looking at right now. They all range from very pricey to quiet affordable. Each have the advantages and dis-advantages.</p>



<p><strong>The affordable bag</strong> </p>



<p>A very affordable bikepacking style handlebar bag I am thinking about purchasing soon is the Roswheel Attack Handlebar Bag. It is a dry bag design that attaches to a outer hook bag design which is attached to the handlebars. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="720" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/roswheel-waterproof-bike-handlebar-bag-bicycle.jpg?resize=720%2C720" alt="" class="wp-image-849" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/roswheel-waterproof-bike-handlebar-bag-bicycle.jpg?w=801&amp;ssl=1 801w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/roswheel-waterproof-bike-handlebar-bag-bicycle.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/roswheel-waterproof-bike-handlebar-bag-bicycle.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/roswheel-waterproof-bike-handlebar-bag-bicycle.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>One of the downsides for me personally and maybe to some other considering a bag like this. As it is a dry bag it is harder to access quickly while riding. So you may need to use a top tube bag or frame bag to store items that you wish to access while riding. This bag is more suited to storing items like a tent, sleeping bag and other gear that you use for the most minimal amount of time in a day.  </p>



<p>A great thing about this bag is that it is waterproof. As some cheaper bags don&#8217;t offer this option. </p>



<p><strong>More expensive option</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="424" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bikepacking_bp_7909-1.jpg?resize=600%2C424" alt="" class="wp-image-852" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bikepacking_bp_7909-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bikepacking_bp_7909-1.jpg?resize=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The Ortlieb handlebar-pack, is more pricer. However the brand is very established and respected in the cycling community. While also being waterproof. It makes sense to splash out a bit more on a bag like this. For the guarantee of longevity and a quality product. </p>



<p><strong>Something to consider</strong></p>



<p>Depending on your handlebar setup. Some tight drop bars, may bag may not accomodate or allow for enough room for hand placement. And you may not have full storage capabilities. These bags seem to be ideal for flat handlebar setups. </p>



<p><strong>What I am looking for in a bike handlebar bag for bicycle touring?</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Extra Storage space / volume</strong>. For storing many more items that I must access multiple times every single day. And the Bell bag didn&#8217;t give me that much room for storage. I would love if a bag was deep enough to store my vlogging camera with the Gorillapod attached. For easy access when I need to capture a moment. </li><li><strong>Waterproof</strong>. It has to be 100% waterproof if I am going to be storing important items like my camera and wallet. </li><li><strong>Sturdy design</strong> that has a touch of <strong>simplicity.</strong> I don&#8217;t want to have to read a manual to fully understand just how to use the bag. </li><li><strong>Detachable</strong> from the handlebar mounting point. <strong>Easy to remove from handlebars</strong>. If I choose to take it into a shop with me. Preferably not strapped on. Something that just has a quiet click release design. </li><li>Potentially <strong>individual compartments</strong>, or some kind of separation to help with organisation within the bag. So I can store smalls and snack more easily. </li><li>The bag should <strong>last a very long time</strong>. </li><li>Have great <strong>customer reviews</strong> and a <strong>proven track record</strong>. With nothing but phenomenal reviews.  </li></ul>



<p>So I have been doing a lot of research and have also found the <strong>Ortlieb Ultimate Classic 6 Handlebar Bag</strong>. This bag is the traditional bicycle touring design. </p>

<p>I like this bag as it has dividers for organising all my gear. I have heard some people have problems with the magnetic lid closing system of this bag. As it can be difficult at times to open and close the bag. </p>

<p style="text-align:left"> <strong>Something to consider before purchasing a handlebar bag. </strong></p>



<p><strong>How does it attach to your handlebars and will it fit? </strong></p>



<p>Most bikepacking bags are a simple hook and loop fastener and are universal. However some kind of bag attachments may not fit your handlebars. </p>



<p>Before you go out a buy a handlebar bag. Depending on how it mounts to your bike. You may need to consider your handlebar tube diameter. Near the stem clamping area, may differ from handlebars and you need to make sure that the handlebar bag clamp will fit around your bars. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="950" height="950" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/61AUTNM6b2L._SL1500_.jpg?fit=720%2C720" alt="" class="wp-image-828" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/61AUTNM6b2L._SL1500_.jpg?w=950&amp;ssl=1 950w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/61AUTNM6b2L._SL1500_.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/61AUTNM6b2L._SL1500_.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/61AUTNM6b2L._SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/61AUTNM6b2L._SL1500_.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p>This was my experience with the Klickfix handlebar adaptor/mount. The size that came with the handlebar bag was too small for my handlebars. But however I was able to order a larger piece to fit. But just have the in mind. </p>



<h2>Stem Bag</h2>



<p>Also know as feed bags. These are cool little additions to your bikepacking setup. There are some local handcrafted designs out there like. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wizard.works/?hl=en">Wizard Works</a> is one example of these types of brands that are out there. They create some wicked stuff. Buying from small brands is cool. It maybe a little more expensive. As you are paying for blood, sweat and tears. But I prefer to do that and give back. </p>

<p><strong>Why a stem bag?</strong></p>



<p>These little bags are great for storing snacks for the day. That are very easy to access as you ride. Allowing you to stay on the bike as you munch away. They can hold water bottles for extra water on your trips. A vlogging camera really anything that you may want instant access to while riding. </p>



<p>There are so many other options out there. </p>



<p>Moosetreks sell a affordable option which is available for purchase on Amazon.com for ($26.99 each). The best thing about this bag is the mesh storage on the outer side of the bag. Allowing you to stuff gels and tools. </p>

<h2>Top Tube Bag</h2>



<p>A Top Tube Bag is another option for storing even more gear on your bike. It sets in the &#8216;petrol tank&#8217; position just behind the stem. The bag I have is the Roswheel Attack Series Top Tube Bag. Which is available on Amazon for ($34.99) </p>

<h2>Frame Bag</h2>



<p>When choosing a frame bag. You need to really consider size. Many frame bags come in a range of sizes to fit a large array of different frames. </p>



<p>You can buy a custom bag made specifically with your bikes dimensions or you can buy a mass produced bag, but measure before buying. </p>



<p>Do you want a bag that takes most if not all the frame space. Or do you want to allow for room for a water bottle? Or can you have both? </p>



<p>I am currently using the Blackburn Outpost Frame Bag. Comes in size; Small, Medium or Large. This bag back allows you to have the best of both worlds. You can have it fully extended or have half a normal size frame bag. </p>

<p>When packing a frame bag. You should consider packing heavier weight items. As this will help balance out the overall weight on your bike. Allowing for a more comfortable ride. </p>

<p>This bag is water resistant. Waterproof is alway preferred but I notice it does get a little damp on the inside when it gets wet. So I make sure to only pack items that I don&#8217;t mind when they get wet in this bag. </p>



<h2>Rear Panniers or Seat Post Packs</h2>



<p>I am slowly making the transition into bikepacking. As I have always done bicycle touring. So I am using the <strong>Ortlieb Classic Back Roller Panniers</strong>. Which are great they are waterproof and last a long time. </p>

<p>However I am in the market for a new seat post pack or bag. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="601" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/seatpack_f9901_front2.jpg?resize=600%2C601" alt="" class="wp-image-865" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/seatpack_f9901_front2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/seatpack_f9901_front2.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/seatpack_f9901_front2.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>What I like most about these bags is that you don&#8217;t need to fix a rack to the rear of your bike. No panniers rattling around either. </p>



<p>However they downside for me is less space to carry all my camera gear and other gear to sustain me on a long bike tour. Another thing I hear a lot with others who have used these bags is they sway around a little. Ortlieb has a support-strap add on option for more stability. </p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t want to pay up for the quality of Ortlieb. I have been thinking about this cheaper alternative. </p>



<p>The Roswheel Attack Series Saddle bag is a 10L Max bag which is also waterproof. But is $50.99 on Amazon. </p>
