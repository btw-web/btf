<p>Off-road adventure bikes take on the DNA of a touring bike, mixed with mountain biking. There is no set rules for these bikes. They come in many shapes and sizes. The main idea behind these bikes is to allow you to explore the roads less travelled, off-road. </p>



<p>With all that you need to take you where you need to go. From braze-ons for attaching all the gear, strong frame materials, relaxed and comfortable geometry for riding days on end.</p>



<p>Different from a more traditional <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-touring-bikes-2022/">touring bike</a> which is really only good for road riding with full pannier setups. Off-Road adventure bikes excel when it comes to utility and their capabilities, you can pretty much ride them anywhere. They offer ample tire clearances for that extra suppleness over rough terrain. </p>



<p>Ideally an adventure touring bike will have a low climbing gear say around 18&#8243; which is perfect for riding slowly up steep hills with all your gear. Some of the bikes in this list have as high as 25&#8243; climbing gears which is not ideal but the bikes are still worth mentioning if you wish to alter the gearing later on. They still make great adventure touring bikes. </p>



<p>These bikes are your ultimate bikepacking bike. I have covered many different types of bikes on this blog in the past. These bikes are some of your best options for that ultimate bike adventure in 2022! </p>



<h2>Trek 1120</h2>

<p>A bikepackers dream! Built to explore extreme backcountry destinations in the farthest reaches of the world. Offering unlimited off-road capability. The 1120 is built around a rugged all-terrain frame, 29 x 3&#8243; tires, an included rack system and a mountain-ready spec with a dropper post and a 1&#215;12 drive train. </p>



<p>The Aluminum frame and carbon fork build weighs 14.1 kg and is priced at $2,929. With the stock gearing setup you can achieve a 17.99&#8243; climbing gear and 91.46&#8243; highest gear. </p>



<h2>Kona Sutra LTD</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="427" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_ltd-scaled.jpeg?resize=720%2C427&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8028" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_ltd-scaled.jpeg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_ltd-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_ltd-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C607&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_ltd-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C455&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_ltd-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C911&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_ltd-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1214&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_ltd-scaled.jpeg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_ltd-scaled.jpeg?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_ltd-scaled.jpeg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The all new Sutra LTD takes over from last years ULTD. Which is pretty much the same bike but going back to the original name. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/kona-sutra-ltd-review-bikepacking-bike/">I personally own a LTD</a>. With some changes from stock, like wider rubber and smaller front crank for easier climbing. It is a really capable bikepacking bike for your off-road adventures. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s that bike for just about everyone. Maybe you&#8217;re a mountain biker loving the idea of dropbars or a roadie secretly shredding the single track when no one is looking. The Sutra LTD weighs around 13 kg, a full steel build, with 29 x 2.25&#8243; tires and a 1&#215;11 drivetrain. Priced at around $2,599 you get a bike with a &#8216;limited&#8217; climbing gear at 24.93&#8243; and 94.79&#8243; downhill gear. You also get a dropper post and all the mounting options you could possibly need for your camping gear. </p>



<h2>Bombtrack Beyond</h2>

<p>Considered by Bomtrack as their most accessibly-priced adventure touring bike. Weighing at around 12.9 kg and a 2&#215;10 GX, microSHIFT drivetrain with mechanical disc brakes. Options to run either 27.5″ or 29″ wheels. Depending on what size frame you opt for is dependant on the wheel size that comes with your bike. But no matter what you can expect to get 2.0&#8243; wide rubber. </p>



<p>The Bombtrack Beyond is the perfect first bike for someone looking to get into adventure touring! Another full steel bike build, you cant go rough with the ruggedness of a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ultimate-list-of-steel-gravel-bikes/">steel adventure bike</a> in my option. The 2&#215;10 drivetrain offers a 22.22&#8243; climbing gear and 103.70&#8243; highest gear. You also get a rather upright riding position for a dropbar bike with a 1.59 stack/reach ratio for a medium sized frame.</p>



<h2>Salsa Fargo</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="424" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/salsa-fargo-bike-2021-1-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C424&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8032" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/salsa-fargo-bike-2021-1-1.jpeg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/salsa-fargo-bike-2021-1-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/salsa-fargo-bike-2021-1-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C603&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/salsa-fargo-bike-2021-1-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C452&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/salsa-fargo-bike-2021-1-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Fargo is an adventure touring bike classic. The steel frame and carbon fork build offers a lighter option compared to most other bikes in this category weighing in at around 11.1 kg.

You also get different build options when available if thats what your after, with the choice for titanium for those epic and fast adventures.

<h2>Salsa Cutthroat</h2>

<p>The Kona Unit X has to be one of the better value adventure touring bikes you can buy. The all new 2022 Unit X is priced at $1,599 for a full steel build with hydraulic brakes, the 1&#215;12 setup allows for a 18.70&#8243; climbing gear and a 95&#8243; highest gear. </p>



<p>The Unit is a great base to build out into a truely capable adventure touring rig. I have even tossed up the idea of getting this bike and adding a suspension fork for ultimate adventure comfort. </p>



<h2>Surly Karate Monkey</h2>

<p>The Surly Karate Monkey is another great bikepacking bike for those looking to explore the less known trails and singletracks of the world. One of my personal favourite hardtail bikepacking bikes on the market. With up to 140mm trail up front for ultimate comfort. Hydraulic brakes, dropper post, comes with Surly Dirt Wizard 27 x 2.8&#8243; tires with the clearance for up to 27.5 x 3” tires. </p>



<p>When it comes to climbing you get 17.94&#8243; gear inches and 83&#8243; highest gear. Prices start from $2,299.</p>

<p>The All City Gorilla Monsoon falls into the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/15-best-monstercross-bikes-650b-gravel-bikes-in-2020/">monster cross bike</a> category which makes it a great adventure touring bike option. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/all-city-gorilla-monsoon-review/">Check out</a> what we have to say about it here. All City describe this bike as their dirt do-it all solution. A sweet beast designed to handle on- or off-road shredding, bikecamping, short-duration dirt touring, and the pursuit of good times!</p>



<p>Priced from $2,499 you get the ultimate all steel adventure bike build, with 650b x 2.4&#8243; tires, hydraulic brakes and dropper post, with a 1&#215;11 drivetrain, which offers a rather limited 25.01&#8243; climbing gear when compared to other bikes in this list. The all new 2022 Gorilla Monsoon comes in a GRX and Apex build kit. </p>

<p>The Bombtrack Hook made the list for our <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ultimate-list-of-steel-gravel-bikes/">best steel gravel bikes</a> and <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/the-lightest-touring-bike-carbon-touring-bikes/">lightest touring bikes</a> depending on which build kit you are after. The Hook features wider 27.5 x 2″ tires to help you roll over the bigger bumps on the trail or fire road ahead.&nbsp;Lightweight Columbus steel frame paired with a carbon fork for performance and reliability. </p>



<p>Despite multiple build options the Hook ETX weighs 11.2 kg. powered by a 1&#215;11 drivetrain and hydraulic brakes. With a 25.64&#8243; climbing gear and 98.25&#8243; highest gear. You can still expect a rather upright right position with a 1.52 stack/reach ratio which is still great for adventure cycling it is however a little more aggressive then some other dropbar bikes in this list. </p>



<h2>Surly Bridge Club</h2>

<p>Finally the Surly Bridge Club is another great adventure touring bike. a completely capable off-road touring bike, that is a steel frame touring bike with upper mid-range components and hydraulic disc brakes. I have met a few tourers who use this bike for touring and bikepacking rides. </p>



<p>Very versatile with the SX Eagle groupset and options for 26″ / 650b / 700c wheels. The bike comes stock with some nice and wide WTB Riddler 27.5 × 2.4″ tires. Making it awesome for some rough touring conditions pretty much anywhere. Priced at a super affordable $1,200. </p>
