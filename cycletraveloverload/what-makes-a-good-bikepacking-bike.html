<h3><strong>The best bikepacking bike</strong></h3>



<p>Which bike should you use for bikepacking? Is there one answer? In theory you can use any bike for bikepacking. Use the one you’ve got and tailor your first adventure around it. If you own a road bike stick a skinny handlebar bag on it, travel light and stick to more sealed roads. If you own a full suspension mountain bike try a rear rack and a backpack and off you go into the woods!</p>



<p>That being said, there are specifications that will suit your journey type and make it more enjoyable. For example, you wouldn’t take a sports car off-roading and you wouldn’t run a marathon in high heels! You could, but you won’t have the best time during or afterwards!</p>



<p>As with most of life’s big questions there isn’t just one answer and it’s all about the journey. Which bike is best for your bikepacking adventure may not be the same as someone else’s. It largely depends on 2 things:</p>



<ol><li>Where you’re going</li><li>How much load you’re carrying</li></ol>



<p>If your bikepacking trip is taking you off road and off grid for a few days then you want to be travelling light and have a bike that can handle twists, turns, bumps and climbs. You don’t want a heavy sturdy touring bike that will be difficult to manoeuvre or a skinny road bike that will get stuck in the mud. Bikepacking generally differs from touring due to the off-road nature. You’ll be taking your bike on single track trails and into the wilderness, rather than on gravel or tarmac. </p>



<h3><strong>Features of a bikepacking bike</strong></h3>



<p>Usually, bikepacking adventures are shorter and more lightweight than touring ones. This means you’ll be carrying much less weight and it will be distributed differently on the bike. Bikepacking bikes won’t need pannier racks or cargo racks, as you’ll tend to have your load in 3-5 smaller bags carried on the frame.</p>



<p>Similarly, because the bikepacking trips tend to be shorter in length you won’t be as far away from a bike shop or civilisation for mending mechanicals. Touring bikes tend to be very simple for this reason so they are easy to mend should you find yourself stuck in the back end of nowhere!</p>



<p>If you are carrying a lot of load then you need a stiff bike frame to handle this. Bikepackers will be able to have lighter frames than tourers. The twisting forces between the front and rear loads on a touring bike need thicker, stuffer tubes. </p>



<p>Bikepacking bikes usually weigh between 10-14 kg rather than a 14 kg+ touring bike set up. Touring bikes tend to be made from steel, titanium or aluminium rather than bikepacking bikes which can afford some level of carbon fibre. See our article on bike frame materials here.</p>



<p>They tend to have slightly more flex in the frame as they are not built for carrying huge loads. Bikepacking bikes are built for off-road rather than sealed roads, this means they may have rigid or hard-tail design. Incorporating suspension is a benefit of the bikepacking set up, you can still strap a couple of extra water bottles to these if you need to! You can take you and your smaller load over some tricky terrain and not have your brains bashed about. Touring bikes need to hold luggage over the front cargo racks and therefore are not as well suited to front suspension forks. That’s not to say you can’t rig up your full suspension and tear up the trails!</p>



<p>Similar to mountain bikes, the bikepacking setup has a shorter chainstay as there is no need for rear pannier heel clearance and there is a desire for more lively riding.</p>



<p>Bikepacking bikes may not have rack and fender mounts, whereas a touring bike will definitely have these. Likewise, bikepacking bikes will have mounts for multiple tube bags. No one wants to hike-a-bike with pannier racks smashing you in the face!</p>



<h3><strong>Geometry of a bikepacking bike versus a touring bike</strong></h3>



<p>Shorter chainstay &#8211; touring bikes need a longer chainstay for a more central centre of gravity considering the larger load and to ensure your heels do not kick your panniers. Bike packers do not need to worry about this as much and can afford to have a more lively, shorter chainstay for more exciting terrain.</p>



<p>Shorter wheelbase &#8211; with the shorter chainstay comes a shorter wheelbase. Less stability is needed on a bikepacking bike therefore the wheelbase can be shorter and make for more adventurous riding.</p>



<p>Similar stack and reach &#8211; in both disciplines you want a more relaxed and endurance posture. For shorter, flatter and faster bikepacking adventures you could look into racier geometry but you may sacrifice some control on the off-road and longer journeys.</p>



<p>1x Drivetrain &#8211; When thinking about being built for the off-road, these drivetrains generally offer more ground clearance and harsher gear jumps than derailleurs. You will need less fine tuning of gears off-road than on-road. You can also get away with higher climbing gears as you will generally have less weight on you than a touring setup.</p>



<p>Fatter tyres &#8211; we have all seen the rise of the fat tyre bike in the bikepacking world. While these are great for absorbing bumps they do add weight and slow you down so choose wisely. We find nothing wrong with a 2”- 3” mountain bike tyre for most bikepacking adventures. The more load the fatter the tyre. Easy.</p>



<p>All in all, we love people getting out into the outdoors whatever set up they have. If you have a bike you can find a way of bikepacking! That’s the beauty of it. Just plan your routes with what you’ve got. If you’re looking to invest for bikepacking specifically we hope this article can help with what to look out for.</p>
