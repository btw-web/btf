<p>Do you have limited handlebar real-estate for your gadgets or are you looking to mount your bikepacking handlebar roll to your bars but need it mounted offset from your handlebars? There are so many reasons why a handlebar extender can come in handy for bikepacking and bicycle touring setups. </p>



<p>In this article we are going to cover some of the best handlebar extenders to choose from. Recommended by other bike travellers. And dive into some of the reasons why you may want to consider a bar extender for your bike. </p>



<p>Some handlebars offer some great amount of room for gadgets and attaching whatever your really like to them. Most Alt-bars are great or this. </p>



<p>If you are after a handlebar bag setup for bikepacking that does not involve going out and purchasing a complex handlebar system. You could get one of these handlebar extenders, with some bikepacking straps and a dry bag. Attaching the dry bag to the extender with the straps and this being a fully functional handlebar system. A bit of a DIY if you like. </p>

<p>Depending on what your current setup is like. People often get a handlebar extender for there bikepacking rig. When they need room from what they plan to mount on the handlebars from their handlebars to prevent cable jamming and having the handlebar bag to close to the bars. In my other blog article about the best bikepacking handlebar harnesses I show some of the best options that come with a small spacer that props the harness from the handlebar. This is essentially what the extender is doing. But you also get more room to mount gadgets to. </p>



<p>The Rockgeist Barjam Harness system using this exact approach to mounting gear on your handlebars using the bolt-on bar (for 31.8 mm) handlebar extender. If you are interested you could just get this all in one system which works great. Weighing in at 7.8 oz (220 g) with 25″ Voile straps. It is a very secure system. Priced from $75.00</p>

<p>Handlebar extenders are great for more bag support and brining the bags more forward. As you can see in Toni&#8217;s photo above. This is a type of moustache bar that would have some difficulty mounting bags on it. With the addition of a bar extender you can see how much more utility you can get. </p>



<p>There are many generic versions of such a handlebar system. From my understanding you could pretty much be fine getting a $4 from Aliexpress or pay $15 for one from Amazon. Some people do mention that they had to do some DIY fix to make sure that it stayed secure and stop it form spinning. By cutting up an old bike tube to make rubber spacers to create sufficient friction between the bar and the clamps that hold it in place. </p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="683" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/610O1S6fXfL._AC_SL1001_.jpg?resize=720%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4345" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/610O1S6fXfL._AC_SL1001_.jpg?w=804&amp;ssl=1 804w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/610O1S6fXfL._AC_SL1001_.jpg?resize=300%2C285&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/610O1S6fXfL._AC_SL1001_.jpg?resize=768%2C729&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/610O1S6fXfL._AC_SL1001_.jpg?resize=50%2C47&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>You can also find some cheap generic options from Amazon if you are interested in just giving this type of system a go and see what it can offer you. This Kbrotech Bike Handlebar Extender private label product is okay to get the job done. it is a couple dollars more expensive then some other options. but this product has the most reviews so personally I would trust this product more. <a href="https://amzn.to/2rNQE2n">Priced at $16.99</a></p>



<p>Another thing to consider with these handlebar extenders is to, put some bar ends, small ones on the ends of the extender. Stops the straps ever slipping and gives another hand position when riding into the wind. Similar to what the <a href="https://www.baryak.com/new-products">complete aero bar design Bar Yak can offer you.</a></p>



<p>Speaking of aero bars, you may want to also consider some aero bars for your bikepacking setup. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bikepacking-aero-bars-why-use-them-handlebar-bags-with-aero-bars/">I also wrote a article all about bikepacking with aero bars</a>. They also make for a great solution for mounting a dry bag to. and offer comfortable riding positions, and more hand positions. </p>



<p>Overall handlebar extenders or handlebar racks whatever you want to call them, are super useful. A great way to turn your bikepacking rig into a even more of a utility vehicle. They can offer a world of potential. </p>
