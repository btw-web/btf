<p>Top Tube Bags are super useful! They are perfect for storing what ever you want. Adding some extra storage capabilities. Especially for bikepacking. If you don&#8217;t have a handlebar pack they work well as a substitute. But if you have a handlebar bag and addition a top tube bag it really gives you much more storage options. </p>



<p>They are great for storing, doodads, thingamabobs, and whatyoumycallits, like; phone, snacks, cash, battery power bank, tools, and other small items.</p>



<p>There are so many options out there. I asked bikepackers and cycle tourers what type of top tube bags they use for their cycle travel setups. Down below a list of them is included with some small details. </p>



<h4>But don&#8217;t you hit those with your knees?</h4>



<p>This is a common question people ask before deciding to get a top tube bag. I guess it comes down to you body type. For me personally I don&#8217;t. I have the Roswheel attack series top tube bag. Maybe from time to time I will graze it with my knee when pedalling. That is when it is fully loaded and rather wide. I am a rather slim build. But it might be a problem if you are a larger body type especially if you have bulky, muscular legs. They are pretty much the same as having a fully frame bag and generally keep about the same width.  </p>



<h4>Does it move about while riding? </h4>



<p>I don&#8217;t really like the Roswheel bag that I have, as it moves about. I have a Surly LHT which is build with very skinny tubing which does not give the velcro strap that much to wrap around, and as a result when the bag is fully loaded and heavy and will move from side to side. This is not really a question I noticed anyone asking. But was something that I noticed from my personal experience. When looking for a top tube bag you want to make sure that the bag attaches rather tightly to the the top tube. Consider that attachment straps that the bag uses. </p>



<h4>How do you get your leg over? When you stand over bike it would be in the way?</h4>



<p>Again a similar question that was asked by someone considering a top tube bag. I would this to be try in my experience also. When you are standing over the bike. There is rather little room with the bag in front of you. But I don&#8217;t think this is that much of a big deal as you will be riding your bike so much more then standing over it. </p>



<h4>Can the phones touchscreen be used through the transparent mesh cover of many top tube bags?</h4>



<p>Most top tube bags have a mesh cover or pocket that allows you to slide your phone down to store it while you are riding and get instant access to it when needed. The mesh on my bag makes it a little difficult to see the phone display, you can some what use the touch screen but is often effected by the mesh. It would be much better to get a phone mount for your bike then using the mesh pockets on these top tube bags in my opinion. </p>

<p>You could even try and get a second top tube bag and use it as a &#8216;bottom&#8217; top tube bag, like Jason has in the example above. This does depend if you have or plan to get a frame bag. Having it mounted on the bike like this it doesn&#8217;t get in the way. You could even try and see how you go fitting one to the inside of the top tube on your seat post, if it is not wide. You might be thinking! Will everything fall out if you open up the bag if it is mounting upside down like that? Well yes, but the trick is to put all your personal items in this bag, like tooth paste and other important stuff that you take of the bike when you use it at the end of the day.</p>



<p>Okay so lets get into the top tube bag option, shall we? Below is the quick list for your reference and further down below I go into some more detail explaining each bag. Hopefully by the end of this article you will have a better idea as to what type of top tube bag you would like for your rig.  </p>

<p>Topeak sell a couple options, I have included two choices in this article as they are a rather popular brand for top tube bags, used by many. This one is available in a Medium or Large size. With a zip opening right up the middle of the face of the bag. It attaches to the bike with nylon straps. It features a battery cable access point which allows you to charge your smartphone on a ride. With a padded compartment which protects contents. The Medium weighs in at 120 g / 4.22 oz while the Large is 150 g / 5.28 oz. You get 0.5 L / 30 ci capacity for the Medium and the Large has 0.75 L / 45 ci capacity. Starting from <a href="https://amzn.to/2rT89ho"><strong>$27.39</strong></a> on Amazon. </p>

<p>The TopLoader by Topeak is a rather similar bag to the one above. It is more or so made for bikepackers in mind. As they say, &#8220;giving bikepackers quick and easy access to energy bars, phone, wallet, tools or any small essential gear they need close at hand.&#8221; Only available in the one size. It has a capacity of 0.75 L / 45 ci which is the same as the Large size bag. This bags features a divided main compartment and padding. The bag is attached with adjustable nylon straps. And also comes with a integrated rain cover. Weighing in at 169 g / 5.96 oz and costing <a href="https://amzn.to/2DOruTv"><strong>$29.00</strong></a> on Amazon.</p>



<h2>Blackburn Outpost</h2>

<p>Blackburn makes some quality and affordable bike bags. I really stand by them. Personally have the outpost frame bag, it is it has held up very well on many epic adventures. This bag works great for the expedition cyclist, but also serves the needs of a long weekend ride or event. It features bolt on attachment options on the top tube, for bike that have the two eyelets. You get a organisation divider that can be taken out and is fixed with velcro on the sidewalls of the inside of the bag. The bags weigh 168 grams and you get 0.5 L OR 31 CU/IN capacity. Also I almost forgot, as standard you get the mesh pocket at the front for your phone. Price is <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2rZIeV7">$44.06</a></strong> on Amazon. </p>

<p>Revelate Designs make some really nice bike bags, however they are a little on the more pricer side of things. I have two top tube bags to share with you from this brand. This Mag Tank is uniques in that the top flap is held in place by a magnetic buckle. A helpful thing to know is that, it will not unintentionally open and spill your gummy bears when you end up in the trees with your bike upside down like a conventional magnetic closure would. It makes for one of the most convenient and easy to use top tube bags on the market. Allowing you to easily open the bag one handed by pulling outward on the cord loop and you have access to the whole top of the bag. Includes padding, adjustable height daisy chain front attachment with a spacer block to clear stem clamp bolts, and it has a beefy tube strap that has gripper material, providing excellent stability. Weight is 127.5 grams or 4.5 oz and volume is 0.9 L or 55 cubic inches. Priced starting from <strong><a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DRevelate%2BDesigns%2BMag%2BTank">$59.00</a></strong> at REI.com</p>



<h2>Revelate Designs Gas Tank</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/09586d70-810f-4bbb-80a9-ac1c17cd8ada.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4180" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/09586d70-810f-4bbb-80a9-ac1c17cd8ada.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/09586d70-810f-4bbb-80a9-ac1c17cd8ada.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/09586d70-810f-4bbb-80a9-ac1c17cd8ada.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/09586d70-810f-4bbb-80a9-ac1c17cd8ada.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The next bag is this Gas Tank. I really love how they have thought about how this bag will be used. The way the zip peals back from the stem is perfect. I found with other bags they become harder to open when the zip gets in the way of the stem. A few things that is different about this bag, is the yellow fabric on the inside which makes for greater visibility. And most other features are similar to the Mag Tank. You get about 1.15 L or 70 CI of volume in this bag. And it weighs in at 99 grams or 3.5 oz. which is rather light when compared to some of the other top tube bags.

<p>If you are after something super budget friendly and has not much style, then the Bell top tube bag is something to consider. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it personally. but there are many cycle tourers who personally use this brand and recommend.
