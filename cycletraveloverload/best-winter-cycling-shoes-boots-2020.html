<p>So you came to this blog because you are looking for winter cycling shoes? Well if you are sold on the idea of cycling shoes specifically made for winter riding then go ahead and check out the options.</p>



<p>But for those of you still on the fence do you really need winter specific cycling shoes? Well that will mostly depend on how winter it is where you plan to be riding? </p>



<p>If you are planning something super epic! Like fat bike packing across Antartica, kudos to you! No really this is on my bucket list! Or maybe somewhere, where it gets rather crazy during the winter season. Then these shoes would be a good investment. If you feel that cold feet would be something to stop you from getting out and staying active on the bike then they seem like a great choice. But if you want to skip the shoes and learn to be one with the cold. Off topic! I have been practising the <a href="https://www.wimhofmethod.com/fundamentals-video-course-introduction?tap_a=24315-f78a22&amp;tap_s=481831-64dac4">Wim Hof breathing method</a> and it has changed my relationship with the cold! One of the things I just learnt from his course today actually was when you keep your core warm, your extremities (hands and feet) will stay warm too. And through his methods you can adapt your body to stand up to some of the coldest conditions. </p>



<p>It would make no sense to buy them if you want to keep your feet warm from slightly cold temperatures. You can just double up or use rather thick socks and waterproof booties. </p>



<p>Obviously when looking for a pair of winter cycling shoes you want some that are comfortable but they need to for comfy for rather cold days in the saddle as well as when trying them on for the first time. </p>



<p>Also the best winter bike shoes are the ones that are easy to unlace. Winter shoes come with Boa&#8217;s, velcro, and some even have the fast lace system commonly found in MTB shoes. These are what you want as getting shoes on and off can be challenge in the freezing cold.</p>



<p>Okay so now lets have a look at some of the best winter cycling shoes you can choose from. In no particular order here they are.</p>

<p>Another good winter cycling shoe option are the Terra Artica X2. They are fairly good choice if you are looking to spend less. The waterproof eVent membrane keeps the elements from penetrating from the outside, but at the same time uses Direct Venting technology to remain breathable. These shoes are warm but the thing that appeals to me is the less bulky build. They maintain a lower profile than bulky winter riding boots. <a href="https://amzn.to/2R2fFA4">Priced from $127</a></p>
