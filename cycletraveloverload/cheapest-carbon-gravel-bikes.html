<p>So you want to carbon gravel bike? But don&#8217;t want to pay the big bucks? Same here! Carbon bikes are often way to expensive to justify! But you are in good luck. </p>



<p>I have been researching all over the web and have gather a list of carbon gravel bikes that are around $2,000 or less. It seems anything around or under this price is a bargain!</p>



<p>Just a word of warning I can&#8217;t gaurantee that any of these bikes are the best, they are simply the cheapest. Having that said I only chose bikes with decent quality components and the ones I am personally considering. I was thinking it would be fund to have a light gravel bike to race around and play on. Most of these bike are around that 8.5 kg to 10 kg mark! That&#8217;s 3 kg lighter then my steel gravel bike.</p>



<p>They would also make some rather good lightweight bikepacking gravel bikes. Not all have a relaxed geometry though. </p>



<p>But that&#8217;s the whole point of this post. To take a look at all the bikes and compared them to see which ones out of all these cheap carbon gravel bikes would be best suite to your type of riding remains. </p>



<p>So without further ado lets get into these bikes, shall we?</p>
