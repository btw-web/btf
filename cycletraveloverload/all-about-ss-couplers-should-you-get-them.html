<p>So you are thinking about getting S&amp;S Couplers installed on your touring bike? I once was also considering the same. As I thought it would be a rather effective way to cut down on overall flight costs when it came to traveling overseas with my bike. They allow you to split your bike into two and make it pack much smaller then using something like a big and bulky bike box. But, are these Couplers all what they are made out to be? And for a price tag of sometimes over $1,000 to get this job done to your touring bike. Is it really worth it? It would seem you would have to fly with your bike a lot to make the initial cost even worth considering, right? Well that is what I written this blog article for. I spent weeks researching and figuring out if it was worth it. As I was going to get them installed on my Surly LHT. Let me tell you why you may want to consider otherwise. </p>



<p>Before I start off by beating down on the S&amp;S Couplers. Say if you already purchased a bike with these installed I can see they do come with some pros. But I am not sure they are worth the big bucks and hassle required to get them fitted to your current bike. </p>



<p>It seems the biggest benefit people say comes with these installed on your bike. Is you say goodbye to baggage charges at the airport. Because you are able to pack your bike small enough it can fit in a regular checked bag that will go on the plane. Many bike tourers have claimed that they are yet to pay for traveling with their bike. This is rather appealing at first glance. No chargers for your bike when flying? Yes please! In retrospect I wish had them installed on my bike when travelling to Europe from Australia. I had to pay around $200 for my bike plus another $200 on my connecting flight. I resulted in some extra dollars worth of unexpected expenses. That could otherwise have been spent elsewhere. </p>



<p>However part of this was my own fault. And a expensive lesson to learn. I now make sure to do thorough  research on airlines, reading the fine line. Even call them up and get clear on how much you will be charged at the gate for your bike. So you are prepared. If you do this right you can get some really cheap deals when it comes to flying with your bike. Even some US airlines have scrapped bike fees recently. But that is for another article, I need to write a post about flying with your bike for cheap, don&#8217;t I? </p>



<h2>Packing S&amp;S Coupler Bike</h2>



<p>Also with the S&amp;S Couplers on your bike, depending on your frame size, you may end up having to take the bike apart more than you&#8217;d like (particularly removing the fork and/or crank) to get things to fit. This is not always ideal. So you will have to pack down and build up your bike more then when you would pack it in a standard cardboard bike box. Which means more time involved. But with the couplers the bike packs smaller which means you can cart it in something like the S&amp;S Case or you could buy a cheap duffle &#8216;type&#8217; bag from the thrift store and then get rid of it when you start your tour (donate it back). Or you could use a soft case and leave it at the first hotel you stay at and then return to that hotel before heading home.</p>



<p>Doing it this way some say they struggle to fit a rear rack when packing and they buy them before they start a tour. To me this is crazy. I am sure there is a way around packing everything you need in a bag that falls under the checked baggage limits, if you are creative enough. </p>



<p>However, some people say that the time you add a rack, panniers, and gear to the equation. I don&#8217;t know how much of a benefit the couplers provide. Easier to use a bigger bike box and include the rack and some bike gear in it versus buying multiple bags. Depends on exactly what gear you need and how you pack. But if you are concerned about fitting racks and all that. You could pack a S&amp;S coupler bike and go bikepacking and just use a bikepacking setup, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/kona-sutra-ltd-review-bikepacking-bike/">something similar to my Kona Sutra LTD</a>.</p>



<p>Depending on how frequently you travel. If you travel within the USA mostly it might be worth skipping on S&amp;S and using a site called <a href="https://www.bikeflights.com/">bikeflights.com</a> </p>



<p>Another thing worth noting with getting Couplers is that if your frame is very small, it&#8217;s actually much harder to pack your bike into the case. You have to remove the fork because otherwise the down tube goes across the centre of the case, right where the wheel hub needs to fit. And if you have racks and fenders, it&#8217;s even more challenging. </p>



<p>Apart from connivence when traveling by plane. The couplers also allow you to take your bike conveniently on trains. When doing a car road trip, keep your bike inside of the car with much less risk of being stolen. &#8220;Best thing since sliced bread.&#8221;</p>



<p>You could try something like a folding bike like the Bike Friday. If you want to read more on folding bikes <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-folding-bikes-for-touring-the-complete-list-in-depth-look/">go here</a>. But personally I could not get used to the ride feel of a folding bike. They are not for everyone, and this is also another reason for why the S&amp;S Couplers could be something to look into getting on your bike. </p>



<h2>S&amp;S Couplers Retrofit</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="504" height="378" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/couplingretrofit05.jpg?resize=504%2C378&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4751" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/couplingretrofit05.jpg?w=504&amp;ssl=1 504w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/couplingretrofit05.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/couplingretrofit05.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>S&amp;S Coupling Retrofit at Rodbikes.com</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>If you go ahead with installing S&amp;S Couplers it is recommended to bring or send your frame to a licensed installer. Also some custom frame builders offer the option for S&amp;S Couplers. Which would be something to look into if you are planning a custom build. </p>



<p>You could go ahead a retrofit yourself if you know what you are doing. But places like <a href="https://www.rodbikes.com/">rodbikes.com</a> are able to do the install for you. But just for those curious here is a simple overview of the retrofitting process. </p>



<ul><li>Masking tape is applied to mark where the frame will be cut</li><li>The frame is then precisely cut where the couplings will be installed</li><li>One at a time the couplings are brazed-on to the steel frame</li><li>The frame is then aligned on a exclusive twin laser alignment table</li></ul>



<p>This is one of those jobs that is best down by someone who knows exactly what they are doing. The biggest concern apart from cutting your bike in half is also getting it aligned when the couplings are installed it all needs to be perfect. <a href="https://www.rodbikes.com/articles/frame_repair.html#couplings">Here is some information of example pricing for a retrofit</a>. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="540" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/89692500_10218877602589894_8270272932211589120_n.jpg?resize=720%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4753" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/89692500_10218877602589894_8270272932211589120_n.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/89692500_10218877602589894_8270272932211589120_n.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/89692500_10218877602589894_8270272932211589120_n.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/89692500_10218877602589894_8270272932211589120_n.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Here is an example of Jay&#8217;s Surly retrofit. They got couplers put on a disc trucker. &#8220;Cost was $600. I love avoiding the baggage fees and being able to fit the bike case in a normal sized car. It’s been totally worth it!&#8221; I can start to see the purpose with a S&amp;S Coupler install on a bike. </p>



<h2>S&amp;S Couplers Case</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="388" height="360" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/p_sns_c13.jpg?resize=388%2C360&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4747" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/p_sns_c13.jpg?w=388&amp;ssl=1 388w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/p_sns_c13.jpg?resize=300%2C278&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/p_sns_c13.jpg?resize=50%2C46&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This is the exact case that is popular with those who use S7S Couplers on their bike. These hard cases are said to provide the highest level of protection for your bike. And are best used as mentioned early for when you plan to start and finish the cycling portion of your travel from the same place. They also work great when you have the ability to ship the empty case ahead to a point where it will be needed for your next flight. All of the cases are small enough to fit in the front seat of a compact truck or in the trunk or back seat of most cars so no special transportation is necessary to get to and from the airport. The original style hard case measures out to the dimensions of 26&#8243; x 26&#8243; x 10&#8243; (66 x 66 x 25.4 cm) you can <a href="http://www.sandsmachine.com/i_cs_dm2.jpg">click here for a dimensioned drawing of the case interior</a>. The retail price for a case like this comes in at around $449.00 and the weight is approximately 17 pounds or 7.7 kg. </p>



<h2>S&amp;S Couplers For Tandem Bikes</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1600" height="600" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tridconvert15-1600_2048x.png?fit=640%2C240&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4752" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tridconvert15-1600_2048x.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tridconvert15-1600_2048x.png?resize=300%2C113&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tridconvert15-1600_2048x.png?resize=768%2C288&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tridconvert15-1600_2048x.png?resize=1024%2C384&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tridconvert15-1600_2048x.png?resize=50%2C19&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tridconvert15-1600_2048x.png?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>When it comes to tandem bikes it seems like a plausible solution. They are such cumbersome bikes to transport as it is. With the help from Couplers they are a great answer. For example transporting the tandem by car would almost be impossible without them. Some great advise would if they give you any extra capability or only saves you a little bit of money each trip then it&#8217;s like any other expensive add on. It is best to do the maths for how often you&#8217;d use them and find out if it would work for your situation. </p>



<h2>S&amp;S Couplers vs Ritchey Breakaway</h2>



<p>So the two most popular was to get the result of a broken down bike frame is with S7S Couplers or the Ritchey break-away system. So maybe you are ready to put together a travel bike and wondering how the Ritchey system holds up against S&amp;S couplers in the long term, durability and ease of use? </p>



<p>Some say that the Ritchey down tube part is not the best. There has been some complains about corrosion. Some builders have been known to use the Ritchey seat cluster and the S&amp;S down tube connector on some builds. The thing is both work. If you are looking for a retrofit S&amp;S is the best. But then again the Ritchey system is one third of the cost. There has been no known deal breakers for the Ritchey, just note that you need to take anti-corrosion measures for the down tube coupling. Also Ritchey has a more fairly basic attachment process compared to S&amp;S. </p>



<h4>User experience with both systems</h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>S&amp;S is clearly the robust option and the Ritchey option I think is much lighter duty. The Ritchey system is easier to use with no special tool to tighten the couplers and doesn’t suffer from getting grit in the threads. I never noticed any difference in lack of stiffness in either systems. I did get some rust on the mating surface of the downtube couplers on the Ritchey.</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Bike Frames With</strong>&nbsp;S&amp;S Couplers</h2>



<p>There are some bikes on the market that offer the S&amp;S Couplers or Ritchey break-away systems already installed and built onto the bike. Saving you they extra hassle to install on your bike. but looking t some of the prices it is costly, but if you have the budget then go for it! </p>



<h4>Break-Away Carbon Outback Gravel Frameset</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="391" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/outback-carbon-1-1.jpg?resize=720%2C391&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4748" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/outback-carbon-1-1.jpg?w=1180&amp;ssl=1 1180w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/outback-carbon-1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/outback-carbon-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C417&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/outback-carbon-1-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C555&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/outback-carbon-1-1.jpg?resize=50%2C27&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you are after a gravel bike with the ability to pack down to nothing. The Break-Away Carbon Outback Frameset might be a great place to start. A frame set of this bike starts at $3149.00. A all round carbon bike, this Ritchey&#8217;s break-away is a versatile adventure machine, that is nimble in conditions that are beyond the scope of a traditional &#8216;cross bike, yet adept for long miles over tarmac. </p>



<h4>Co-Motion Pangea</h4>

<p>If you know much about bicycle touring, you would know of the Bicycle Touring Pro. Darren has a Co-Motion Pangea pictured above. Which has the S&amp;S Couplers installed to break down the bike. The Pangea is the original global touring bike with its standard 26” wheel format, you are sure to find tubes and tires even in the most remote countries. You best value is one of these bikes, with a frame set cost at <em>$1,965 </em>and the complete bike starting at<em> $3,465</em>. </p>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>If you want to read a owners 10 years of experience with an S&amp;S Coupled bike. <a href="https://www.biketouringtips.com/showTipComments.php?tipID=1992&amp;fbclid=IwAR28Ry4VOB6O1O61v-OVJNS4n8pYMAj5UXkyKtJkg5893hYxsoYAMjgW2yo">Check out this blog post.</a> If you plan to get them you are better of investing in a great quality frame. There is no real point adding S&amp;S Couplers to a frame like I was going to with a $500 LHT frame when the couplers cost $700. You are best to upgrade the frame and have it done to a higher level frame. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I am a fan boy of Surly and their frames. But it seems if you have the money to spend it makes sense to get it done to a frame that is built to your specs. But again if you have a tight budget but still want the benefits of the S&amp;S Couplers there is nothing stopping you putting them on a frame like the LHT. </p>



<p>The extra baggage fee is a big reason why some are opting for a S&amp;S Coupler setup on their bikes, and it is also easier to carry standard size bags when the bike is packed down with the help of these couplers. Bt depending on your budget and how often you will be flying with your bike will depend on weather you get some or not. It makes sense in the long run to get them if they are going to save you money. But if you don&#8217;t think you will be traveling all that much with your bike to offset the cost of getting couplers then it might be worth passing. </p>



<p>The conclusion is if it’s only to save in airline fees, don’t bother, a lot of airlines don’t charge anyway. and again if you do your research and find the cheapest prices you should be fine. If you have other reasons mentioned here, trains, tandem, apartment, then it might be worth getting S&amp;S Couplers on your bike.</p>
