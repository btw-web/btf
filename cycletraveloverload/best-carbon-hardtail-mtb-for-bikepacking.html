<p>Are you looking for that hardtail bike to ride fast and pretty much anywhere? These bikes listed below are all make from carbon frames and have been tried and tested out in the field for bikepacking events, races and overnight adventures. </p>



<p>I am personally a big fan of steel bikes, but carbon definitely has its appeal.</p>



<p>When comparing weight of <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-steel-hardtail-bikes-for-bike-adventures/">steel</a>, alloy, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-titanium-hardtail-bikes-for-bikepacking/">titanium</a> and carbon hardtail bikes it can widely depend on brand and models. For most steel hardtail bikepacking bikes you are looking at anywhere from 13 kg to 16 kg. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-steel-hardtail-bikes-for-bike-adventures/">Although there is this one steel hardtail which weighs around 12.2kg!</a> While these carbon bikes listed below start from around 11.5 kg.  </p>



<p>Due to this lighter weight you can ride faster than most other material hardtails. </p>



<p>But how strong is a carbon fibre bike? Will a carbon fibre hardtail be strong enough? These are a few concerns people have when looking for a carbon hardtail.</p>



<p>The reality is that carbon bikes actually have a strength to weight ratio that is higher than steel. Carbon frames are relatively strong, and hold up to a significant amount of force.</p>



<p>If strength is a number one priority and you want something that is bomb-proof, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-steel-hardtail-bikes-for-bike-adventures/">steel is best</a>. If you want a bit of both worlds. Strength of steel (or more), and similar (slightly more heavier weight of carbon.) I would recommend looking into a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-titanium-hardtail-bikes-for-bikepacking/">Titanium hardtail bike</a>.</p>



<p>This brings our first concern with carbon bikes. They are susceptible to impacts and damage isn’t always visible. But you are more likely to damage a carbon bike, by damage I mean break the frame, then steel. If it does break carbon is much more difficult to repair.</p>



<p>But if you just want the lightest possible hardtail and want to go nothing but fast! Carbon is your go too.</p>



<p>With carbon frames you can achieve damping qualities and comfort similar to high-end steel and titanium bikes. Not all carbon is created equal. Just because a bike is made from carbon does not mean it’s good quality or suitable for a specific application.</p>



<p>That is why we have done the hard work for you. Below is a list of carbon hardtails that are recommended by fellow bikepackers around the world.</p>



<h2>Santa Cruz Chameleon Carbon</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="418" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MY21_Chameleon_C_R_27_Bronze-1.png?resize=720%2C418&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7877" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MY21_Chameleon_C_R_27_Bronze-1.png?w=1870&amp;ssl=1 1870w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MY21_Chameleon_C_R_27_Bronze-1.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MY21_Chameleon_C_R_27_Bronze-1.png?resize=1024%2C594&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MY21_Chameleon_C_R_27_Bronze-1.png?resize=768%2C446&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MY21_Chameleon_C_R_27_Bronze-1.png?resize=1536%2C891&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MY21_Chameleon_C_R_27_Bronze-1.png?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MY21_Chameleon_C_R_27_Bronze-1.png?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Santa Cruz Chameleon is one of my person favourite carbon hardtail options on the market. A perfect choice for your bikepacking adventures. Just like the Chameleon changes colours and adapts to its environment so too does this bike. Except for the changing colour part. A bike that can be used in a multitude of different ways! </p>



<p>You get tire clearance for up to 29 x 2.6” or 27.5 x 2.8” tires maybe even to potential to squeeze in some 29 x 2.8” or 27.5 x 3.0. New dropouts means they slide out rather than pivots like previous models. The new dropout also has a removable derailleur hanger. The bikes weighs around <strong>12.41 kg or 27.36 lbs</strong></p>



<p>Taking a look at geometry comparing the 2022 with previous models for a large sized frame. There is a 13mm increase in stack and 5mm in reach on the 2022 model. Also a 10mm longer chainstay length, around a 48mm longer overall wheelbase length. 20mm longer trail and around 35mm more front centre. And finally the standover height for the 2022 model is lower by 35mm. </p>



<p>Also this <a href="https://youtu.be/3QHMT8tXdjg">video</a> is worth a watch to get you in the mood! </p>



<h2>Kona Big Honzo CR</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="414" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/big_honzo_cr-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C414&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7879" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/big_honzo_cr-1.jpeg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/big_honzo_cr-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/big_honzo_cr-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C442&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/big_honzo_cr-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Big Honzo CR hasn&#8217;t been updated since 2020. So from my understanding there are no new models out which are carbon builds. But you might still be able to find this bike. It also another great option for your next lightweight, trail shredding bikepacking adventure. </p>



<p>The bike is specced with a 27.5+ wheel, but has the ability to run a 29” wheel if you wish. It has one of the lowest standover heights compared to most bikes in this list. Making riding more fun and the bike extra manoeuvrable. </p>



<h2>Diamondback Sync&#8217;r Carbon</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/m6DiamBack-1-of-6-1.jpeg?resize=580%2C334&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7881" width="580" height="334" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/m6DiamBack-1-of-6-1.jpeg?w=1250&amp;ssl=1 1250w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/m6DiamBack-1-of-6-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/m6DiamBack-1-of-6-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C591&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/m6DiamBack-1-of-6-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C443&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/m6DiamBack-1-of-6-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Diamondbacks most progressive hardtail is a great bikepacking option. An all-new monocoque carbon frame design features a tapered headtube and Boost rear spacing for increased stiffness. A 140mm travel Fox 34 Float Performance fork can handle aggressive riding and big moves. With 29×2.5&#8243; tires. With tire clearance for up to 27.5×2.8”. Fitting perfectly into the genre of ultra-capable hardtail bikes.</p>



<h2>Salsa Woodsmoke</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="404" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2781d-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C404&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7884" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2781d-1.jpeg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2781d-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2781d-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2781d-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>One of the more unique looking carbon hardtail bikes in the list. The Woodsmoke by Salsa, thanks to the unconventional asymmetric, and remarkably short, ‘mid-stay’ chainstay frame design. Which has got mixed reviews. Is this why it has been discontinued since 2019? Not sure but if you can pick up this bike it might be worth checking out for a bikepacking rig. </p>



<p>The goal with the Woodsmoke was to create a bike that bridged the gap between trail and adventure rig. Designed to fit both 29+ or classic 29er tires with a 120mm fork, or the 27.5+ wheel/tire combination with a 130mm fork. Resulting in a one bike to do it all. </p>



<h2>Trek Stache</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Stache97_19_23113_A_Primary-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7886" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Stache97_19_23113_A_Primary-1.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Stache97_19_23113_A_Primary-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Stache97_19_23113_A_Primary-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Stache97_19_23113_A_Primary-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Stache97_19_23113_A_Primary-1.jpeg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Stache97_19_23113_A_Primary-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Stache97_19_23113_A_Primary-1.jpeg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If mid-stay chainstay is your thing. The Stache by Trek like the Woodsmoke also features an alternative looking chainstay giving the bike that different aesthetic. The Stache 9.7 model is their lightest 29+ trail hardtail, weighing in at <strong>28.3 lbs or 12.8 kg</strong>. It&#8217;s built with an OCLV Mountain Carbon frame that&#8217;s shockingly light for its oversized appearance, and a premium RockShox Pike Select Plus fork with 120 mm of travel. With a whopping tire clearance for 29&#215;3&#8243; tires.</p>



<h2>Specialized Epic Hardtail</h2>

<p>The Epic Hardtail from Specialized is a rather popular bikepacking hardtail shredder. They have come out with a light bike, but not one that sacrifices comfort for weight. Like XC race bikes coming to stand for a harsh, twitchy ride at the expense of capability and versatility. The bike weighs in at around 11.5 kg or 25.3 lbs. </p>



<p>A bnike that is used for endurance events all over the world, its fast! It&#8217;s as capable as it is comfortable with aggressive singletrack-inspired geometry, increased tire clearance and a frame obsessively engineered for increased vertical compliance. </p>



<h2>Niner Air 9 RDO</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="407" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/air-9-rdo-promo-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C407&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7890" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/air-9-rdo-promo-1.jpeg?w=1236&amp;ssl=1 1236w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/air-9-rdo-promo-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/air-9-rdo-promo-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C579&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/air-9-rdo-promo-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C434&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/air-9-rdo-promo-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>
