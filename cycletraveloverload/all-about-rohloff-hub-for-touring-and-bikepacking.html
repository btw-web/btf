<p><strong>What is the Rohloff hub?</strong></p>

<p>Simply speaking, it’s an internal gear hub offering 14 evenly spaced gear speeds that’s been around for a while. It uses a simple twist shifter to change between the gears. Internal gear hubs pride themselves on the lack of maintenance they require and therefore less tools you need to take with you. The Rohloff is a special hub in the way that it is designed. </p>



<p><strong>How does Rohloff hub work?</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="594" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/csm_rohloff_speedhub_schnittmodell_ohne-Grundplatte_6553848510.png?resize=720%2C594&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5810" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/csm_rohloff_speedhub_schnittmodell_ohne-Grundplatte_6553848510.png?w=780&amp;ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/csm_rohloff_speedhub_schnittmodell_ohne-Grundplatte_6553848510.png?resize=300%2C247&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/csm_rohloff_speedhub_schnittmodell_ohne-Grundplatte_6553848510.png?resize=768%2C633&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/csm_rohloff_speedhub_schnittmodell_ohne-Grundplatte_6553848510.png?resize=50%2C41&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The short answer, it’s complicated!</p>



<p>We have tried to break it down into simple terms so you can get your head around it. Not that you’ll ever be taking it apart!</p>



<p>It is based around epicyclic or planetary gearing principle, a classic design of all internally geared systems. This means there is a ‘sun’ gear in the centre, circling ‘planet’ gears and an outer ‘ring’ gear. Unlike other gear hubs, the Rohloff speedhub uses the ‘sun’ gear as the input component powered by a single speed chain on a single cog. They all sit inside a self contained, oversized hub, swimming smoothly in oil keeping them constantly lubricated.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>As you twist up and down through your gears the mechanism inside switches up and precisely aligns itself for smooth and accurate gear changes. As your chain isn’t moving between sprockets there’s no clunking or slipping, making it a lot more consistent that a regular drivetrain.</p>



<p>It is calibrated in the Rohloff factory before it gets to you so it needs no adjustments.</p>



<p><strong>What about other types of gear hubs?</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rohloff-Speedhub-XL-1000x667.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5812" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rohloff-Speedhub-XL-1000x667.jpg?resize=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rohloff-Speedhub-XL-1000x667.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rohloff-Speedhub-XL-1000x667.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rohloff-Speedhub-XL-1000x667.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>There are lots of different types of internal gear hubs, ranging from older, simpler 3 speed models to newer, more complex 11 speed models. The more gears means more moving parts, which means more frequent servicing. The simpler 3 speed options could last years without a service, whereas, the higher gear models need looking at every 12-18 months. Rohloff&#8217;s are renowned for being robust and will only need an oil change every 5,000 kms.</p>



<p>Other gear hubs need their shift cables changing periodically because they control the precision of the ‘planetary’ components. This means, if they’re slightly lagging and you push on through then you will be grinding up the insides and ruining your hub. As we outlined above, the Rohloff uses a different internal system and will not grind itself up if your cables get damaged.</p>



<p><strong>What are the benefits for touring and bikepacking?</strong></p>

<p>When<strong> </strong>we are out touring the world, we want to know that our bike can stand up to the terrain and the distance. Here’s a few reasons why the Rohloff comes up top when touring and bikepacking. </p>



<ul><li><strong>Longevity</strong>. The robust design on the Rohloff means it can go and go without you having to worry about it. You can learn to change the oil yourself and leave it to do it’s magic.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Smooth accurate gear shifts</strong>. Because of the unique design and oil based functionality the Rohloff is smooth and quick when twisting between gears. </li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Shifting multiple gears at once</strong>. The twist shift means you’re not left clicking away over tricky terrain. Some experienced Rohloff users claim to be able to shift 8 gears in one swift twist!</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Less mechanical failures</strong>. Due to its ‘sun’ gear input component there are less options for mechanical failure. Rohloff themselves claim to have never had a hub sent back due to mechanical faults! Due to its ‘fixie’ looking design, there is also no chain de-railing or slipping happening en route. You could fit it with a belt drive for even less issues.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Internalised gearing means less environmental damage</strong>. This is true for all internalised gear hubs. They are self contained meaning the outside world can’t get in. When you’re on unsealed and muddy roads this is where the Rohloff excels. </li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Reduced cleaning needed</strong>. Due to its self contained nature you’re not going to be spending hours getting your toothbrush between cogs. So you can go and get really muddy and not be dreading the clean!</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Oil change every 5,000 kms</strong>. For your usual bike packing and short term touring trips that means probably once a year, for the more adventurous that might mean twice a year. You can take it to a specialty shop or you can easily get the know how to do it yourself.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>You can shift when stopped</strong>. Unlike derailed systems you can choose what gear you want when you’re stopped and just get straight back on with it. A very useful feature when riding in urban environments.</li></ul>



<p><strong>It sounds too good to be true, what are the setbacks?</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="540" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rohloff-lht.jpg?resize=720%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5815" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rohloff-lht.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rohloff-lht.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rohloff-lht.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rohloff-lht.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rohloff-lht.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Nothing in this world is perfect and there are a few issues that come up regularly when reviewing the Rohloff.</p>



<ul><li><strong>The ratchet mechanism inside on certain gears can get a bit noisy. </strong>Due to the way the gears work through 1-8 there is a ratchet mechanism inside making these particularly noisy which can ruin those peaceful sunny rides.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Twist shifting takes some getting used to. </strong>If you’re on dropped bars you will have to get an adaption. There are a lot of options out there now including steering pole mounts, divisible handlebars and the ‘Rohbox’ which allows you to change up and down with each shift lever. Whatever your bar style you will have to get used to it.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>You can’t mend it yourself</strong>. As we have said, it’s rare anything will go wrong but if it does, you will have to send the parts off or take it into a specialist shop. If you’re out in the wilderness it’s unlikely one of them will be close by!</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Nowhere stocks the parts</strong>. This is a specialist bit of kit. Your average bike shop <em>might</em> stock some basic parts if you’re lucky but odds are they won’t and you’ll have to order them online or travel to somewhere that has them. </li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>All this engineering is expensive</strong>. We all knew this was coming, a basic Rohloff hub will set you back around $2000 (AUD). On top of that you will need a new wheel construction, you may need new bars and you may even want it gold plated! </li></ul>



<p><strong>Why should I consider a Rohloff hub for touring and bikepacking?</strong></p>



<p>To summarise the above, having an internal gear hub is one of the best upgrades you can do if you&#8217;re serious about touring and the Rohloff is quite simply the best out there. It is the most reliable and the one that can take the most battering. You’ll be taking less tools with you and cleaning less often. </p>



<p>The mechanisms of the Rohloff mean it can just keep on going on whatever terrain you throw at it whilst carrying you and your bags smoothly around the world.</p>
