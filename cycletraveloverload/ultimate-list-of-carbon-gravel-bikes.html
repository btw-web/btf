<p>So you want a carbon gravel bike? Here at Cycle Travel Overload we are mostly about adventuring by bicycle. Carbon is not your most popular material for that. Steel or Titanium is more a go to. </p>



<p>However carbon has its many advantages. The main one being weight reductions. Carbon is simply a lighter material, this allows for some of the gravel bikes in this list to be around 7kg! Comparing my 13kg steel gravel/adventure bike that is a whopping 6 kg in weight saving. </p>



<p>Due to this lighter weight you can ride faster then most other material gravel bikes. </p>



<p>But how strong is a carbon fiber bike? Will a carbon fibre gravel bike be strong enough? These are a few concerns people have when looking for a carbon gravel bike. </p>



<p>The reality is that carbon bikes actually have a strength to weight ratio that is higher than steel. Carbon frame a relatively strong, and hold up to a significant amount of force. Only if it is applied in the direction it was intended. </p>



<p>If strength is a number one priority and you want something that is bomb-proof, steel is best. If you want a bit of both worlds. Strength of steel (or more), and similar (slightly more heavier weight of carbon.) I would recommend looking into a Titanium gravel bike. </p>



<p>This brings our first concern with carbon gravel bikes. They are susceptible to impacts and damage isn’t always visible. But you are more likely to damage a carbon bike, by damage I mean break the frame, then steel. If it does break carbon is much more difficult to repair. </p>



<p>But if you just want the lightest possible gravel bike and want to go nothing but fast! Carbon is your go too. </p>



<p>With carbon frames you can achieve damping qualities and comfort similar to high-end steel and titanium bikes. Not all carbon is created equal. Just because a bike is made from carbon does not mean it’s good quality or suitable for a specific application. </p>



<p>That is why we have done the hard work for you. Below is an ultimate list of carbon gravel bikes. </p>



<p>Our criteria for choosing these bikes, was they had to obviously be a carbon frame. While also only being the newest and most updated models available. They have mid to upper quality components. </p>



<p>Normally we only choose bikes with a 1.5 stack/reach ratio or higher. As this means a more upright seated position making all day riding much more comfortable. But because carbon bikes are often faster this means smaller ratios and more racer riding positions to be more aero on bike. So we still included bikes with as low as 1.4 stack reach ratios. </p>



<p>Also there is no particular budget, so bikes up to $10,000 can be expected in this list. If you want to checkout the best carbon gravel bikes under $2,000. (we have this article in the pipelines, so stay tuned for that). </p>



<p>Also that brings me to another thing to consider about carbon gravel bikes. They can be expensive. Due to all the weight saving you pay for it. </p>
