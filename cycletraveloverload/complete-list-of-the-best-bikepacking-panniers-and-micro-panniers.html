<p>Most often people refer to bikepacking as a endeavour that is similar to bike touring in terms of travelling by bike. However they say one of the main differences is using bikepacking bags instead of panniers. However, as bikepacking is a minimalist style of bike touring this means that it requires you to cut down on your gear making for a lighter rig. But bike bag brands have tapped into this need, and offer &#8216;bikepacking panniers.&#8217; Which are essentially panniers that are generally smaller then your average road touring panniers. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="467" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/36184b4244dab4a2944733b51acb8b56ebe2cba40ca3b0268a3f1855964b20e3.jpg?resize=700%2C467&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4099" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/36184b4244dab4a2944733b51acb8b56ebe2cba40ca3b0268a3f1855964b20e3.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/36184b4244dab4a2944733b51acb8b56ebe2cba40ca3b0268a3f1855964b20e3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/36184b4244dab4a2944733b51acb8b56ebe2cba40ca3b0268a3f1855964b20e3.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>These bikepacking panniers are often referred to as; micro, mini, nano or small panniers. However, you can get away with running larger sized panniers on a bikepacking setup. It is called &#8216;Tripoding&#8217;, which is where you take a bikepacking setup say with a bikepacking saddles bag and other bike bags (this is where creativity and mixing and matching comes into play.) And you chuck on a front rack and run larger panniers on the front wheel. This style is more like a hybrid of what I would call road bike touring and bikepacking. Having such large panniers at the front allows for better manoeuvrability where you can steer around tight section a lot easier then trying to sail the rear of the bike down single tracks. And others would also argue that it is better balanced and offer easier overall bike control running panniers on the front. </p>



<p>This complete list includes some of these larger pannier options that bikepacking enthusiasts use and recommend. While the majority of the bikepacking panniers in this list are those that are classified as micro or smaller then your general road touring panniers. </p>



<p>When looking at bikepacking panniers there a few things to compare to find the set of panniers that is best for your type of adventure and use. First you need to identify what type and where you will be riding. Is it tight single track stuff, or off-road tracks, or are you looking to mostly ride road by with the likes of a bikepacking setup? All the mini panniers are going to be great for any off road stuff, yes even the tight sections. They are designed to allow for that extra storage while still not compromising usability while riding. The slightly bigger panniers may still be fine but you will have to have in mind that it is a possibility, if riding single tracks that you will have some close calls. </p>



<p>The idea behind bikepacking panniers is to offer you that little extra storage capacity to make a bikepacking trip or expeditions possible. Being is you have planned some very remote sections that could see you days and days with no contact to supplies where you may have to stock up with a few days worth of food. </p>



<p>Weight is a factor! Especially for bikepackers as that is one of the main reasons why people opt for this type of bike travel as it is lighter weight. Then you have capacity but striking a nice balance between capacity and how large &#8216;physically&#8217; the pannier is, in terms of being able to ride it in some tight trails, without compromise. But lets get into these panniers and see what you have to choose from, here is a complete list of bikepacking panniers that will be perfect for your next adventure when you need to take just a little more gear. </p>



<h2>Ortlieb Gravel</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-36.jpeg?resize=446%2C329&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4100" width="446" height="329" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-36.jpeg?w=644&amp;ssl=1 644w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-36.jpeg?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-36.jpeg?resize=50%2C37&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>These Gravel panniers are Ortliebs take on bikepacking panniers. One thing you can trust with Ortlieb is longevity of product and waterproofing. I have a set of the Classic panniers and I have heard nothing but great feedback on these smaller sized bikepacking gravel panniers. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="592" height="518" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-2-3.jpeg?resize=592%2C518&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4101" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-2-3.jpeg?w=592&amp;ssl=1 592w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-2-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C263&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-2-3.jpeg?resize=50%2C44&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>You get a combined payload of 25 liters for additional gear such as mess kits, food and other “luxury” items. Designed to be mounted on a lowrider bike rack to maintain a lower centre of gravity, for easier manoeuvrability when it comes to off-road riding. They weigh a total of 1160 grams or 40.9 ounces. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F128477%2Fortlieb-gravel-pack-panniers-pair">$180.00 at REI.com</a></p>



<h2>Arkel Dry Lite</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dry-lites-saddle-bags-harness-system-2-1.jpg?fit=640%2C607&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4103" width="436" height="413" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dry-lites-saddle-bags-harness-system-2-1.jpg?w=1365&amp;ssl=1 1365w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dry-lites-saddle-bags-harness-system-2-1.jpg?resize=300%2C285&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dry-lites-saddle-bags-harness-system-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C729&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dry-lites-saddle-bags-harness-system-2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C971&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dry-lites-saddle-bags-harness-system-2-1.jpg?resize=50%2C47&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></figure></div>



<p>These Arkel Dry Lite panniers or as they are called saddle bags are truly the ultimate waterproof light &amp; fast touring saddle bags. Coming in at only 540 grams they are designed for lightweight bikepacking. They are built with a velcro strap fastening design that has both of the bags connected and laid over the rack. Meaning they fasten to the rack really well. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>One of the things worth noting is the bags don&#8217;t have a whole lot of structure like you can expect in other panniers. But this is due to weight being cut! In result you get a very minimal bikepacking pannier which has its purposes. With a combined total storage capacity of 28 litres or 1708 cube inches, you get some large amount of storage potential for very little bag weight. Also the slim profile of these bags is also appealing! Priced at a reasonable <strong>$84.99 CAD</strong></p>



<h2>Revelate Nano</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/a7a509d7-2b38-41ab-89dd-070176465283.jpg?resize=429%2C408&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4105" width="429" height="408" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/a7a509d7-2b38-41ab-89dd-070176465283.jpg?w=550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/a7a509d7-2b38-41ab-89dd-070176465283.jpg?resize=300%2C285&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/a7a509d7-2b38-41ab-89dd-070176465283.jpg?resize=50%2C48&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Revelate Nano panniers also take up a similar design to the Arkel bags however they are a even slimmer profile, with a zip closure. Great for carry heavy and dense stuff like food. The Nano Panniers at only 3&#8243; wide at the seams, provide just enough extra carrying capacity of 13 L per pair and are 16.4 ounces (465 grams) per pair they don&#8217;t weigh you down. <strong>Priced at $150</strong></p>



<h2>Bedrock Bags Hermosa UL</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hermosa-Bike.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4106" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hermosa-Bike.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hermosa-Bike.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hermosa-Bike.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Hermosa-Bike.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>When comparing prices of all these bikepacking panniers, these Bedrock Hermosa UL com in at a hefty price tag of $300 for a pair. But having that said they did win gear of The Year award in 2018! They are &#8220;extremely lightweight panniers&#8221; at under 1.5 pounds or 680 grams for the set! Which is still heavier compared to the other options in this list. The attachment design to the rack is solid with zero movement or rattle on the contact points. Using waterproof materials the bag has a roll top closure design.  Available in a number of different colors. </p>



<h2>Porcelain Rocket Microwave</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1538" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P1360594_2048x.jpeg?fit=640%2C481&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4107" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P1360594_2048x.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P1360594_2048x.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P1360594_2048x.jpeg?resize=768%2C577&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P1360594_2048x.jpeg?resize=1024%2C769&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P1360594_2048x.jpeg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P1360594_2048x.jpeg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>Porcelain Rocket have gone above and beyond, delivering the goods with a new look on bike panniers. Completely re-designed the whole idea. Which is definitely a selling point, they offer a bikepacking pannier that is unique. As I browsed their site at the moment of writing this article I can say that they have sold out. They are a smaller brand that hand makes all their stuff, but there panniers must be popular! It is a genius two-part system: a quick-access RF-welded dry bag, and a rugged holster that stays securely on any rack. So when ever you need to take off and leave your bike behind for a day trip in town, you can quickly and easily that the dry bags with you if you needed. For the pannier you can expect a weight of around 460 grams per pannier, complete / 920 grams per set. And a maximum of 13 L per pannier / 26 L per set. <strong>Priced at $275.00 CAD</strong></p>



<h2>Jandd Wet Rabbit Mini</h2>

<p>Considered I guess a more larger bikepacking pannier option best suited for Tripoding due to its larger size. The Wet Rabbit Mini is still as the name suggests a pannier that is smaller then some other models. And is suited to the cyclist who is looking for a budget friendly option. It is good for some average rainy weather conditions. The pannier has a single main compartment which uses a standard dry bag rolled top closure system. 3M Scotchlite Reflective Material for greater visibility, and a double layer of material to strengthen the bag. </p>



<p>One of the great things I love about this brand and a strong reason to support what they are doing. Is they take part in recycled and sustainable manufacturing. Making the world a more greener place, support a brand with this kind of vision is what it is all about. Each panniers has a volume of 668-987 cube inches or up to 16L. (Volume is expandable by rolling the top down less). The weight is 21 ounces or 595 grams per pannier. They only cost <strong>$50.00 each</strong>. </p>



<h2>Alpkit Toliari 12L or 5L</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tolairi-12-main.jpg?fit=640%2C845&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4111" width="324" height="426" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tolairi-12-main.jpg?w=1173&amp;ssl=1 1173w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tolairi-12-main.jpg?resize=768%2C1013&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tolairi-12-main.jpg?resize=38%2C50&amp;ssl=1 38w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></figure></div>



<p>Alpkit also offer some cheaper bikepacking pannier options with their Toliari line with a few different volume sizes available. These panniers are waterproof for commuting and cycle touring and bikepacking. Hardwearing, reliable.

<p>The Lone Peak Mount Superior panniers are again not really considered bikepacking panniers however they make some great bikepacking panniers.

They have been making bags for a while from what I understand and they have not changed much of their design since, which is cool. Made in the USA, they use a super-durable, water resistant 1000 D Textured Nylon. </p>



<p>The details are as follows. Volume is 3200 cubic inches per pair or 54 Liters. Weight 3.5 lbs (pair) or just over 1.5 Kg. And the Dimensions are 18&#8243; Tall x 12&#8243; Width x 7&#8243; Depth 7&#8243; (10&#8243; with fully stuffed outside pocket). Costing <strong>$239.95</strong> for the pair</p>

<h2>Arkel XM-28</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/arkel-xm-28-pannier-black.jpg?resize=274%2C468&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4119" width="274" height="468" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/arkel-xm-28-pannier-black.jpg?w=417&amp;ssl=1 417w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/arkel-xm-28-pannier-black.jpg?resize=175%2C300&amp;ssl=1 175w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/arkel-xm-28-pannier-black.jpg?resize=29%2C50&amp;ssl=1 29w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>At first I was wondering to myself if these could be classified as bikepacking panniers, they just looked to big! But Arkel are marketing these as &#8216;bikepacking&#8217;. And on second thought to be honest they are what one needs in a set of bikepacking panniers. Very quality product with heaps of storage potential. They weigh 1.92 kg or 4.2 lbs (pair) and have a capacity of 28 L. / 1700 cu. in. (pair). Available in a black or yellow. They are built for mountain bikes with limited heel clearance. What is great about these panniers is the thought and design around the accessibility. They are essentially top-loading panniers but have side-slicing two-way zippers that will allow you to get hold of smaller items lower down inside the bag. Costing <strong>$212.46 CAD</strong> for the pair. </p>



<p>If you are looking for an alternative to getting some bikepacking specific panniers. You could just get some heavy duty dry bags and mount them onto a rear or front rack with some Voile Straps. Or you could make your own panniers! DIY bike bag building and design is fairly popular in the bike travel community and there are some videos and information out there to learn from. But if you are looking for that perfect set of bikepacking panniers for your next adventure then you cannot go wrong with any of the options listed above. </p>
