<p>The Salsa gravel bike battle! Well which bike is best? We are going to compare these two iconic gravel bikes side by side and see what the difference is between each. When it comes to price the Warbird&#8217;s base Apex model is $100 cheaper at $2,599 when the Cutthroat starts at $2,699. But what really is the difference and which one is best for you and your riding goals?</p>



<p><strong>The Cutthroat is classified by Salsa to be a bike suited for, Ultra-endurance mixed surface and bikepacking riding. As it was inspired by the Tour Divide bikepacking race! A much more capable bikepacking bike with a more upright riding position compared to the Warbird, longer wheelbase, and a more stable ride feel. While the Warbird on the other hand is considered best for gravel racing, fireroad riding and road riding! With a more racy geometry and slightly lighter weight.</strong> <strong>Also the cutthroat comes with 29&#8243; wheels compared to 700c on the Warbird.</strong> </p>



<p>It makes it rather easy to figure out which bike out of these two are best for you, if you know what you are going to be using your bike for the most. Looking to go mostly bikepacking? Then the Cutthroat. What about mostly road riding with some gravel here and there? Then the Warbird. But wait, there are some other things you should consider before making that final decision!</p>



<h2>Salsa Cutthroat Bike Models</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at each of the bikes and see which options offer which components and features. There are four Cutthroat options and three Warbird bikes. </p>



<p>****Also it is worth noting that since August 2020 Salsa have released a safety notice on Cutthroat V2 Fork which are the forks on all these Cutthroat bikes. It is recommended to head to their blog to see information if your current fork is affected. I am not sure I would purchase one of these 2020 models. It is disappointing but from what I read online people have had some bad experiences.****</p>



<p>I am personally waiting until the 2021 models come out and hopefully the problem is fixed. But you might still be okay to go ahead and purchase a Cutthroat with the V2 fork, just make sure to ask the retailer about this and determine whether the bike has an affected fork. And you can get it replaced by Salsa if this is the case. </p>

<p>Then the highest end Warbird model is the GRX 810 which is a carbon frame gravel bike with high-end components and hydraulic disc brakes. With a Shimano RX810-2, 48/31t (RX600, 46/30t with 165mm arms on 49cm size) crank and Shimano HG800-11, 11–34t cassette. Weighing <strong>19.8 lbs / 9.0 kg</strong> and <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FSalsa-Warbird-Carbon-GRX-810-2x">priced at $4,099</a>. The bike has a <strong>25.29&#8243; climbing gear</strong> and 121.19&#8243; highest. Which is ever so slightly easier at climbing than the $5,799 Cutthroat. </p>



<h2>Difference in Specs (Build, Wheels and Groupset) Cutthroat Vs Warbird</h2>



<p>Below in the tables I have gathered all the specs of each bike and stacked them side by side for a better visual representation of all the build, groupset and wheel differences. </p>



<p>The main differences between the Cutthroat and the Warbird is handlebars, saddles and rims/tires with slight variations in groupset components and rings. </p>

<h2>Geometry – Cutthroat Vs Warbird</h2>



<p>Geometry can play a big part in the difference of how I bike rides and feels. It is definitely something to consider when buying a bike. It is clear to see that the Cutthroat is better designed for long days in the saddle, exploring with bikepacking gear loaded on the bike. Thanks to longer wheelbase, chainstay, and more relaxed angles. Along with a more upright position. While the Warbird is adapted for road riding with some gravel grinding here and there. All the measurements below are in mm and are for both 56 cm sized bikes.</p>

<p>You can clearly see how much more upright and comfortable the Cutthroat is geometry wise when it comes to adventure cycling.</p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Bike</strong></td><td><strong>Cutthroat</strong></td><td><strong>Warbird</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Stack</strong></td><td>619.53</td><td>584.85</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Reach</strong></td><td>385.28</td><td>381.19</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Stack/Reach Ratio</strong></td><td>1.61</td><td>1.53</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Top Tube Length</strong></td><td>560</td><td>560</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Seat Tube Length</strong></td><td>508</td><td>510</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Seat Tube Angle</strong></td><td>74.25</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Head Tube Length</strong></td><td>127</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Head Tube Angle</strong></td><td>69</td><td>70.75</td></tr><tr><td><strong>BB Drop</strong></td><td>70</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Front Center</strong></td><td>655</td><td>618</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chainstay Length</strong></td><td>445</td><td>430</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wheelbase</strong></td><td>1090.31</td><td>1038.21</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rake</strong></td><td>51</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Trail</strong></td><td>79</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Standover Height</strong></td><td>810.51</td><td>770.11</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>The Salsa Cutthroat has a 1.61 stack/reach ratio which is nice and upright compared to the 1.53 on the Warbird, this is still rather upright for a gravel bike. The chainstay on the Cutthroat is 445 mm which makes it on the longer end feeling rather chill in the back compared to the Warbird&#8217;s 430 mm chainstay which is in that mid range making it feel like an all-rounder in the rear. </p>



<p>The trail on the Cutthroat is on the high end at 79 making it rather sluggish and stable at the front. While the Warbird is 69 which is still in that high end of trail lengths for gravel bikes. But more stable than sluggish. Also the Warbird has a 40.4 mm lower standover height compared to the Cutthroat. </p>
