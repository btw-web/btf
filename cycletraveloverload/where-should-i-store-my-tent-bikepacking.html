<p>Are you new to the bikepacking world? Want to know where and how to pack a tent with all your other gear? I get it, bikepacking can take a little testing to get that setup that works perfectly for you. </p>



<p>I come from a touring background. Which is where I got started in the world of bike travel. Most bike tourers just strap their tent to the top of the rear rack with a bungee cord. </p>



<p>But if you ditch the panniers and go full bikepacking bag setup, finding a spot for a tent can be somewhat troublesome. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I wrote this article to give you inspiration and new packing ideas, for your next overnighter or week long adventure. </p>



<p>There are so many different angles you can approach this with. </p>



<p>The most common method of tent storage on a bikepacking bike, I have seen is between the handlebars. </p>



<h3>Handlebar Harness &amp; DryBag</h3>



<p>I personally use a dry bag to house the tent on bike attached to the handlebars with a handlebar harness. <a href="https://www.wiggle.com.au/restrap-bar-bag-holster-food-pouch-dry-bag">This</a> is the exact product I use. It even comes with a smaller accessories bag that attaches to the top of the dry bag which is great for electronics and wallet. </p>



<p>I stuff the tent as compact as possible into the drybag and store the poles separately in a frame bag. </p>



<p>Before making a final decision on a handlebar harness setup. Most fit in drop bars, but you will be limited, and might not be able to use the full capacity of larger dry bars. If you have flat bars you can fill theses bags to the limit. </p>



<p>Also handlebar harness mounts are only really compatible with disk or V brakes only. And are generally not compatible with cantilever or road style front brakes with a vertical exposed cable. </p>



<p>But overall this method of storing a tent on bike is probably the most popular in the bikepacking world. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/13-best-bikepacking-handlebar-harness-and-mounts/">This article is handy</a>, if you want to take a look at some more harness and drybag systems. </p>



<h3>Salsa Anything Cradle Mount</h3>



<p>Another option is the Salsa Anything Cradle, it is a uniquely designed mounting system for handlebar storage. Salsa claim this design to be a superior bikepacking solution to the dry bag and strap or handlebar rolls that folks have been accepting for years. </p>



<p>The design allows for the Cradle to sit away from your handlebars allowing room for cables. Weighing 420 grams with hardware, maximum load weight is 8 lb (3.7 kg)</p>



<p>Again you might need a to get a seperate <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bikepacking-dry-bags-some-of-the-best-options/">waterproof dry bag</a> to store the tent in then attached to the Anything Cradle. No one likes a wet tent!</p>



<h3>Seperate Tent In Parts</h3>



<p>As I hinted earlier you can always seperate your tent and store in different areas on your bike. Ideally I like my setup to be organised enough so that I store camping gear in one section of bags and food and then daily use items, all in their dedicated areas. </p>



<p>But if you are struggling for room to store your tent. You can take the poles and store them in a frame bag or even attache them directly to your bikes frame. Maybe seperate the rain fly and the body of the tent. </p>



<h3>Saddlebag / Seat Bag</h3>



<p>You can always test your current setup and see where the tent might fit. If you have a saddle bag, you can stuff your tent in there easily enough. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-bikepacking-saddle-bags-seat-packs-a-buyers-guide/">Checkout these saddlebags</a> and why you should consider getting one if you don&#8217;t already. </p>



<h3>Two Straps and Your Tent</h3>



<p>If you want to keep things simple, you can directly attach your tent to the handlebars with some straps that you might have laying around. Or something like the <a href="https://seatosummit.com/product/stretch-loc-tpu-straps/">Stretch-Loc TPU Straps</a> from Sea to Summit. </p>



<h3>Bikepacking Tents (With mount ready tent bags)</h3>



<p>Just get a tent that mounts directly to the bike, without any straps or bike bags. This tent from Big Agnes straps directly to your bikes handlebars. The bag the tent comes in is purposely designed to attach directly too handlebars. Which is super handy!</p>



<p>The stuff sack (that&#8217;s waterproof) that doubles as a handlebar bag and shorter tent poles are what makes The Big Agnes Bikepacking Tent range so versatile. Not to mention lightweight and ultralight weight tent builds, to suit all different bikepackers. </p>



<p>These tents are ideal if you don&#8217;t want to buy other bike mounting gear to store your tent on bike. Buy the tent and it comes with mounting capabilities sorted. </p>



<h3>Ditch the Tent All Together</h3>



<p>Maybe a tent setup is not for you! Many bikepackers are opting for alternative shelter options. As they look for lighter setups that require even less material to pack on bike. </p>



<p>During summer months I often don&#8217;t even bikepack with a tent. And will often just sleep directly on the ground. With my lightweight sleeping pad with a r-value that keeps me warm and sleeping bag. You can just camp under the stars. But this is not for everyone and I understand that. </p>



<p>If you want to save weight and the potential space required to pack a tent these options can provide a solution you might be looking for. </p>



<p>It comes down to your comfort level. Do you want a tent to change in and a large private space to feel comfortable on month long adventures. Or does this not bother you too much?</p>



<p>If you can sacrifice some comforts that a bigger tent offers. Then potentially Bivy Bags, Tarps Setups, Hammocks and other alternative bike camping methods might be better for you. </p>



<p>Lightweight Bivy Bags generally weigh less than most tents, but you do get less room to sleep. They are popular with bikepacking races. Providing a fully inclosed shelter but less weight to carry on bike. Personally I don&#8217;t see the value in a bivy. </p>



<p>With <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/complete-list-of-40-best-bikepacking-tents/">ultralight-weight tent</a> innovations over the years, you can find a lightweight tent for a similar price. Plus you get the benefits of sitting up under shelter and more room, plus ability to store gear under shelter our of the weather. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bikepacking-bivy-bags-should-you-get-one/">Consider reading more about bivy bags</a>, it will help you decide if you should get one or not. Also <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-ultralight-bivy-for-bikepacking-and-touring/?relatedposts_hit=1&amp;relatedposts_origin=4170&amp;relatedposts_position=0">checkout these Ultralight Bivy Bags/Sacks</a>.</p>



<p>If you want to go super lightweight, but you are not worried too much about the weather. A <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/9-best-bikepacking-tarps-bike-tarps-for-your-next-adventure/">tarp setup</a> might be a good choice. You can get tarps that weigh as little as 100 to 200 grams. Ideal for summer riding. If you like to be fully immersed in nature a tarp can be great.</p>



<p>The thing that appeals to me with hammocks is the packability! <a href="https://seatosummit.com/product/ultralight-hammock-single/">This hammock</a> weighs just over 200 grams, and packs in any bag on your bike without taking up barely any space. Paired with a fly net and/or hammock tarp. This can be a plausible lightweight and packable bike camping shelter solution. </p>



<p>The thing with hammock camping is people say &#8220;you need trees&#8221;. But if you are camping somewhere with no ideal trees. It almost makes it a fun game at camp time. To wonder around trying to figure out where to set your hammock up. Depends how you look at this. It can be considered a negative compared to a tent which can be setup just about anywhere. </p>



<p>Also they do say hammock sleeping, when done right, is the best form a sleeping. <a href="https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/news/20110621/hammocks-help-you-sleep">Studies </a>have proven that we are able to sleep deeper in a hammock compared to our own beds. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bicycle-touring-with-a-hammock-lightweight-camping-setup/">Read more here</a> if you want to find out if hammock camping is something you might want to try.</p>
