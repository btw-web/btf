<p>If you are like me and in the market for a tough and adventure ready hardtail bike specifically made from steel, then you came to the right blog. Personally I am looking for the best steel hardtail. And after looking all over the web I have narrowed down the choices. </p>



<p>For me these bikes must be ready out of the box for bike adventures. Being made from steel helps. Steel is a tough material that is forgiving once you fully load up your bike with gear. Along with sufficient mounts for racks or cargo cage and water bottles.  </p>



<p>Take a quick look here to compare all the steel hardtails listed below to see what one stacks up in each category of specifications. </p>

<h2>Why Ride Steel?</h2>



<p>Personally I have a thing for steel bikes and apart from having so much fun putting this article together. I have found there to be some really great benefits to opting for a steel built bike!</p>



<p>You would think that high-tech frame materials like carbon, aluminum and titanium are taking the cycling scene by storm these days. But I am happy that steel is still being used by adventure bike manufacturers and they still see the important of the ‘old school’ material. When I first got into exploring by bike, I was touring and touring bikes are mostly made from steel. Due to the demands of generally carrying heavy loads and hauling all your gear. You need a bike that has the&nbsp;<strong>strength</strong>&nbsp;for many days in the saddle.</p>



<p>Some of the better steel used for bike frames are more fatigue resistant and stiffer for a given volume than titanium or aluminium. Which is why you may see some of the well built steel bikes with slender tubing. Not all steel frame bikes are built with really skinning tubing but for bikes like Surly the slender design helps provide more in valuable space along the chainstay between the tyre and cranks.</p>



<p>Along with strength, steel bikes offer&nbsp;<strong>toughness or durability.</strong>&nbsp;Making them built for adventure riding. You can scratch up, dint, and bend steel frames but still ride the bike for years and years. As this material is less effected by the abuse expected when you are out there on the trails. Also steel fails relatively slowly, giving you chance to fix a crack or a bend before it becomes dangerous.</p>



<p><strong>Weight</strong>&nbsp;was a downside for steel bikes for awhile. But I believe it is a thing of the past. For example I own the&nbsp;<a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/kona-sutra-ltd-review-bikepacking-bike/">Kona Sutra LTD 2020</a>&nbsp;and when i was shopping around and picked this thing up at the bike shop. I was so surprised with how light it was. Now steel is not going to be a lightweight as carbon or potentially Titanium and Aluminum. But it is up there with these materials, now days! Most of the more modern steel gravel bikes are around that 10kg (22 pounds) to 13 kg (28.5 pounds) range. Thanks to the likes of thinner tubing. Also some of the bikes in this list have a carbon fork combo with steel frame which makes the overall weight lighter. Also with modern high-end, high-tech steel the wall thickness can be as thin as a can of coke. </p>



<p>Furthermore on weight a steel bike probably weighs about 2-3 kg more than the equivalent carbon bike. And we are all about adventure riding more so then racing. But if you are into bikepacking races and all that. Steel still provides as a viable option. With all the added accessories to your bike like pedals, body weight, other gadgets, bikepacking bags and gear. That little extra weight really would not matter too much. And certainly doesn’t matter to me as someone who is just out there to explore.</p>



<p>Then you have&nbsp;<strong>ride quality!</strong>&nbsp;Many people who love steel will talk to you non-stop about how well it handles, even myself if you get me started! Steel rides with stiffness, comfort and liveliness. From experience with my 2020 model gravel/adventure bike, it glides over the really rough stuff like floating on clouds! Yes along with the suppleness of gravel tires. Combined with a steel frame. That is strong and flexible, you experience comfort and it is rather easy on your joints. Steel dampens vibration better than aluminum and doesn’t transmit as much shock through the frame to the rider, creating a smoother ride feel.</p>



<h3>Esker Japhy</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="383" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s1600_photo_126858.jpeg?resize=720%2C383&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7286" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s1600_photo_126858.jpeg?w=1596&amp;ssl=1 1596w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s1600_photo_126858.jpeg?resize=300%2C159&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s1600_photo_126858.jpeg?resize=1024%2C544&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s1600_photo_126858.jpeg?resize=768%2C408&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s1600_photo_126858.jpeg?resize=1536%2C816&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s1600_photo_126858.jpeg?resize=50%2C27&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/s1600_photo_126858.jpeg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The &#8220;Japhy was born out of the desire to ride everything from the backyard to the backcountry.&nbsp;It is designed and built to satisfy your adventurous side, and is equally at home on your favorite flow trail or an overnight epic. Japhy is the hardtail you reach for no matter what the ride ahead promises.&#8221;</p>



<p>The bike has been designed around modern frame geometry and custom steel tubing for a playful and responsive character out on the trail. Japhy uses a custom drawn, externally tapered, seamless, quadruple butted, heat treated 4130 cromoly tubeset that is specific to each frame size. </p>



<p>Built with a 120mm fork and clearance for up to 29&#215;2.8 tires. Which is rather tight and might fall short of a true 29+ trail bike. The bike also lacks rear rack mounts, rather heavy at approximately 31 pounds or 14kg. Also if you get a smaller frame it might be difficult to get a frame bag to fit. </p>



<p>It does however include some good bikepacking traits. With frame bag mounts, adjustable dropouts and external cables. The versatile Portage dropout system was designed for riders to easily switch drivetrain types, hub widths, chainstay lengths, and accept racks. </p>



<h3>Niner SIR 9</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="443" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pf-da20d563-SIR9HEROXO1EagleBlack-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C443&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7289" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pf-da20d563-SIR9HEROXO1EagleBlack-1.jpeg?w=1300&amp;ssl=1 1300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pf-da20d563-SIR9HEROXO1EagleBlack-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pf-da20d563-SIR9HEROXO1EagleBlack-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pf-da20d563-SIR9HEROXO1EagleBlack-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C473&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pf-da20d563-SIR9HEROXO1EagleBlack-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Niner Sir is made from &#8220;rugged, reliable, comfortable Reynolds 853 steel&#8221;. Build for &#8220;spinning up the steeps, bombing down the backcountry and grinding out the final miles as the sun sinks into the horizon, you need a bike you can trust.&#8221; But it is also built to be a bikepacking beast.</p>



<p>With many mounting options, 18 to be exact! Giving you the freedom to run racks, fenders, bottles, frame bag, bento box and more. The SIR 9 is strapped with a 120mm travel FOX suspension fork and clears 29&#215;2.4” (or 27.5&#215;3.0”) tires, and offers easy options for geared or singlespeed drivetrains.</p>



<p>The bike features a trail ready geometry. Meaning longer top tube and slacker head tube angle. So the SIR 9 is stable, trail specced and ready to get shreddy! </p>



<p>More on the &#8220;Trail Country&#8221; geometry. A combination of modern trail bike geometry and traditional cross-country geometry. The steep 74-degree seat angle gets you centered over the BB for climbing and pairs nicely with the short 430mm chainstay length for supreme peddling efficiency. And of course, the slack, 68-degree head tube angle and long wheelbase contribute stability and self-confidence when you’re dropping into the steepest lines. </p>



<h3>Marin Pine Mountain</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="444" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4888125-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C444&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7291" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4888125-1.jpeg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4888125-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4888125-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C631&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4888125-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C473&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4888125-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4888125-1.jpeg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Another XC Trail MTB option. The Pine Mountain from Marin is a classic steel hardtail with modern trail capabilities. It is designed to take you on adventures! With this bike fitting into the bikepacking/adventure bike category. With a geometry blending the stability and raucous fun of aggressive trail geometry with all day comfort and pedalability for a wide variety of trail.</p>



<p>Marin offer the Pine Mountain 1 or 2. The Pine Mountain 1 uses a butted and formed Series 2 4130 CrMo frame with Boost 141mm dropouts, full fender and rack mounts, and tons of bosses for a wide variety of gear mounting options. Or Series 3 tubing and cast thru-axle dropouts with the Pine Mountain 2 with a 120mm travel fork. </p>



<p>For further bikepacking ability the bikes main feature is the brazed-in cargo attachment points throughout the front triangle. Allowing you to attach all the gear you could possibly need for a fun get away! </p>



<p>This bike is decently priced and a good option for those looking for an entry level bikepacking bike. However some things on the bike have been a let down. The Vee Tire Flow Snap tire that come with the bike don&#8217;t preform well and might be unsafe if you want to full send it! Overall it could do with upgrades, on paper the handlebar sounds and look nice but it is said to feel too stiff&nbsp;and the fork is okay. But you get what you pay for and this bike is budget friendly which is a big positive. Getting people on bikes for less coin, can&#8217;t complain about that! </p>



<h3>Ribble HT 725</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="447" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HT_725_SX_side_angle-1.png?resize=720%2C447&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7295" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HT_725_SX_side_angle-1.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HT_725_SX_side_angle-1.png?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HT_725_SX_side_angle-1.png?resize=768%2C477&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HT_725_SX_side_angle-1.png?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>So what is the HT 725 from Ribble? The HT 725 is a high-end Hardcore Hardtail manufactured from Reynolds 725 tubing and designed for the toughest UK trails. Available in three main builds, with SX, NX or GX Eagle groupsets. The bike is built from Reynolds 725 steel providing durability and compliance. </p>



<p>Including a slack 64° head angle matched to a long top tube and short stem to hit the sweet spot for handling, along with a 150mm travel fork. The design of this bike really caught me eye. The carefully placed gussets and CNC bridges provide rugged durability. Looking above the rear wheel you can see the sleek and stunning design. Clean lines with fully internal cable routing which includes a dropper post, adds to the overall aesthetics and design of the bike. Also with the BikeBuilder on their site, you can pick 1 of 7 anodized colour packs included with this bike, consisting of matching Level headset and seat clamp plus frame and wheel decals. Just to add even more to the design! </p>



<h3>Surly Karate Monkey </h3>

<p>The Karate Monkey is a multipurpose hardtail mountain bike. And the keyword here is ‘multipupose’. This bike was originally designed as a 29er (and the frame that helped spark the 29” wheel movement), the latest Karate Monkey is designed to perform just as admirably as a 27.5+ rig as well. It is up to date with modern trail standards. This means you get dropper post compatibility, 44mm headtube, Gnot-Boost rear spacing, thru-axles, 140mm travel fork. </p>



<p>I must admit I am a Surly fan boy! This is the bike I am looking to get for my first steel hardtail! Why? Partly aesthetics and bikepackability! Is that even a word? It is now! With clearance for 29” x 2.5” or 27.5” x 3” tires. Just look at that bike. </p>

<p>Another green steel hardtail beast, The Big Honzo ST from Kona. It comes set up as 27.5+ but can run a 29” wheels. </p>



<p>The bike has adjustable dropouts, so you can run a front derailleur or even as a single speed. It’s got boost spacing for extra stiffness and control. It’s got an NX/SX Eagle drivetrain, so it climbs with ease. The Big Honzo delivers a playful ride thanks to the shorter chainstay than half the bikes here. </p>



<p>A fun bike to ride on a range of terrains, meaning great for bikepacking but it is at home on fast and flowy trails with intermittent rock gardens. This bike will not blow your mind when it comes to performance in a certain style of riding. Which is not really needed for adventure cycling. It is a tough and robust bike that will get the job done. </p>



<h3>Kona Unit X</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="378" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C378&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7303" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?w=1800&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C538&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C403&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?resize=1536%2C806&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C26&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-kona-unit-x_share-1.jpeg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Kona Unit X is not a hardtail. But it has the potential. Considering this bike is rather affordable as a rigid build. I have been throwing around the idea of getting on and chucking on a nice suspension fork. Also it is a popular bikepacking bike! </p>



<p>A fan favourite among Kona diehards as a bike that is most practical in their lineup. Often described as a &#8220;bikepacking monster&#8221; with SRAM SX Eagle 12-speed drivetrain and modular dropouts which give you the ability to run it as a single speed if that’s your thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few things the bike could be improved on, considering the bike is so cheap it really is not an attack on Kona. But these are some modification you could consider when getting the bike if you choose. Is wide handlebars and a dropper seat post. Then potentially wrapping the chainstay to protect from chain-slap. </p>



<h3>Ritchey Ultra</h3>

<p>The Ritchey Ultra is only available as a frameset but would make a great base for a mean steel bikepacking hardtail. The Team Edition frameset is so perfect! Been titled a &#8220;XC bike that does a whole lot more&#8221;. That have been making this bike for the past 30 years, which proves the bike is a legend. The new Ultra occupies a unique ride space from cross-country riders looking to get rowdy and go big to enduro riders lusting for some all-mountain shredding. </p>



<p>The Ultra is highly versatile! Designed around a 120mm travel fork and super stable Boost 148 spacing. Designed to accommodate 29&#8243; or 27.5&#8243; wheels. Making it compatible with 27.5 x 2.8 and 29 x 2.4 tires. Along with internal routing for a dropper post. </p>



<h3>Cotic BFE Max</h3>

<p>The Cotic BFE Max is a Hardcore Hardtail MTB. A combination of both the <a href="https://www.cotic.co.uk/product/solarisMAX">SolarisMAX</a>&nbsp;29er trail hardtail with Cotic&#8217;s 27.5&#8243; wheeled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cotic.co.uk/product/BFe">BFe</a>&nbsp;do-it-all fun machine. With a whopping 160mm travel fork and 29 inch wheels. </p>



<p>Along with the <a href="https://www.reynoldstechnology.biz/materials/steel/s-853/">Reynolds 853</a> steel build, the long wheelbase of 1213.9mm helps eat up the bumps and makes you feel like you are not going as fast as you really are on super sick downhill sections. Giving you more confidence while descending. </p>

<p>Finally the Norco Torrent features a long reach, slack head tube angle and steep seat tube angle to provide more powerful pedalling, increased climbing traction and added grip and control when descending. Some would say the The ultimate All-Mountain hardtail experience. </p>
