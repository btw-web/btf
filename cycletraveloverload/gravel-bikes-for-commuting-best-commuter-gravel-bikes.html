<p>Gravel bikes have the versatility to be used for a number of cycling disciplines. There is good reason to why they continue to grow in popularity over the last few years. You can use them for <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-for-bikepacking/">bikepacking adventures</a>, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ultimate-list-of-the-fastest-gravel-bikes-gravel-race-bikes/">racing your roadie mates</a>, or casually riding around town. </p>



<p>These bikes listed below are more suited to cruising around town or the daily commute to work. Yes that means the less travelled commute! The off-road commute when the conditions are not always smooth! </p>



<p>Having that said in my own opinion I believe adventure focus gravel bikes make the perfect commuter bike. And you also get the extra benefit to take it out on some weekend adventures. As some of the commuter focused gravel bikes will be restricted when it comes to tire clearance and even geometry. Just not being overall suited for bikepacking if that is what you are also interested in. Also <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/using-a-touring-bike-for-commuting/">touring bikes make some great commuter bikes</a>. </p>



<p>So what makes a great commuter gravel bike then? </p>



<p>It is common for commuters to run rack and pannier setups on their bikes. Making it easier to transport your gear to and from work. Therefore <strong>a bike with braze-ons</strong> to <strong>mount racks</strong> is ideal. Then you can get a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/17-best-convertible-backpack-panniers-in-2019/">backpack pannier</a> to attach to the rack and when you get to your location use it as a backpack! Also <strong><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/all-about-fenders-mudguards-for-gravel-adventure-bikes/">fender compatibility</a></strong> is also nice. </p>



<p>Also <strong><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-flat-bar-gravel-bikes/">flat bar bikes</a></strong> seem to be more popular for commuting. This is highly debatable topic all it takes is a leap into the reddit multiverse to see that there is mixed opinion. But generally flat bars offer wider grip which results in better control. However drop bars can be just as good, offer more hand positions and other benefits. </p>



<p>Geometry seems less important for a commuter as in general you are not riding the further or for a very long time. Not like a adventure bike which needs a more upright riding position that needs to offer comfort for multiple days of riding back to back. However comfort is definitely something to be considered. But it comes down to personal preference. Do you want a bike to ride fast which means more aero riding position or something that is more comfortable meaning upright riding position. Looking at the bike stack/reach ratio generally anything over 1.5 is going to offer comfort that is more upright. </p>



<p>So what are some of the best commuter gravel bikes out there?</p>

<p>This entry level gravel bike features a full aluminium setup with modest components, with a 2×8 Claris and mechanical disc brakes. Priced at $899, rolling on 650b wheels with the WTB Venture Comp 650x47c tires. It is considered by Kona to be ideal for the commute, gravel trail, or the after-work fitness lap on your local hill. </p>



<p>The gearing has a FSA Tempo Adventure, 34/50t crank and Shimano Claris 11-34t rear cassette. Which results in a climbing gear of 26.54 inches and 120.74 gear inches for the largest gear.</p>



<p>Taking a look at this bikes geometry it has a 66 mm trial. Which means it is on the stable end and is rather predictable. The chainstay is 435 mm which puts it in that mid range making it rather quick and almost an all-rounder. The stack/reach ratio is 1.52</p>



<h3>Specialized Diverge Expert E5 EVO</h3>

<p>The all new Specialized flat bar gravel bike has to be a personal favourite at the moment. You could say this bike is redefining the notion of gravel grinding.</p>



<p>When it comes to the bikes geometry it is more progressive then the new drop bar Diverge. With an increase in the reach, slackened head tube and lowered the bottom bracket, resulting in a rather planted feeling.</p>



<p>The bike is MTB inspired, with a 1 x 12 high end level XT, Praxis groupset, hydraulic disc brakes and a dropper post. Built around an alloy frame and carbon fork. Rolling on some 700x42mm tires, you get max clearance for 47mm with a 700c wheel and 2.1” with a 650b wheel. You also get a Praxis Zayante carbon 1X, 40T crank and Shimano XT, 12-speed, 10-45t cassette.</p>



<h3>Caletti Scrambler Flat Bar City Shredder</h3>

<p>The Macho Man flat bar gravel bike is perfect for those who are looking for a fast, responsive, bike for quick trips around town or off-roading. With their expanded size range they do a great job at preserving the bike size dimension as the bike scales for larger and small sizes. Meaning that for 43,46, and 49 sizes the Macho Man as 650B size wheels and 700c wheels on the other frame sizes. </p>



<p>Smaller riders will benefit from smaller top tube lengths and the greater acceleration that a lighter, smaller wheel provides. Built from a 612 Select CroMoly frame and 4130 CroMoly Fork. </p>



<p>The bike features bi-plane lugged fork crown, signature brazed-on seat collar, signature vertical dropouts, custom bottom bracket, bottle boss reinforcements and an E.D. coating. It clears a 38c tire (650b x 42c on the smaller sizes) with plenty of room for mud, has fender mounts for rain days, and rear rack capability. Powered by a SRAM Apex 1 rear derailleur with 11 speed. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FAll-City-Macho-Man-Disc-Flat-Bar-Bike">Priced at </a><strong><a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FAll-City-Macho-Man-Disc-Flat-Bar-Bike">$1499</a></strong><a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FAll-City-Macho-Man-Disc-Flat-Bar-Bike"> at Tree Fort Bikes.</a></p>

<p>The Joureyman is Salsas entry level gravel bike option. As Salsa says, “The Journeyman provides features the cycling enthusiast is looking for to take on their first gravel race or their first ramble down that old ‘B’ road.” Priced at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FSalsa-2019-Journeyman-Claris-650">$999</a>&nbsp;from Tree Fort Bikes and wherever else you can find it available.</p>



<p>Out of all the bikes in this list, the Journeyman Claris 650 would have to be up there with one of my personal picks. But why is that? Let me explain. Salsa has an incredible track record and is up there with quality like Surly (my favourite bike brand!).</p>



<p>Aesthetically this bike just works. I really like the dark green earthy tone. And the overall geometry and proportions are pleasing. It rides comfortably on rough terrain with good traction, thanks to the wider 650b wheels. There is three mounting eyelets on either side of the Fantail fork, allow you to carry extra water or gear, or to run a low rider rack and panniers. However the Journeyman does come in two different tyre/wheel sizes (700c x 37mm or 650b x 2.1″).&nbsp;<a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/salsa-journeyman-review/">Read our review of the Journeyman here</a>.</p>



<p>The bike’s Claris setup features the FSA Tempo Adventure, 46/30t crank and SunRace 8-speed, 11-34t cassette. When we calculated the gear inches accounting for the WTB Nano 27.5 x 2.1″ Comp tires. The result was; 25.52″ for the climbing gear up to 121.23″ for the largest gears. With ratios of 0.88 to 4.18.</p>



<p>When it comes to the Journeyman’s geometry, the stack/reach ratio is 1.54 (getting very close to that upright and comfortable riding position for long days in the saddle). The trail is 64 mm making it feel predictable at the front and chainstay length is 440 mm , making it rather chill and ride like an all-rounder in the rear.</p>

<p>A gravel/adventure bike, just what I like! Here at Cycle Travel Overload we are all about adventure cycling. This could be the budget gravel bike to take you on some epic adventures. But also make a great daily commuter! If you are looking for one bike for the commute but also go on weekend adventures, then look no further! Also with drop bar options.</p>



<p>This bike has taken on the Poseidon X geometry but has been amped up so you can eat up gravel with enough tire to absorb the vibrations. Allowing for 27.5 wheels with enough clearance for 2.5″ tires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The build features a 6061 Double Butted Hydroformed Aluminum frame and 6061 Aluminum Fork – Tapered Steer 1 1/8″ – 1 1/2″ fork. Powered by a 1 x 10 Advent X groupset. This means a Prowheel 38t Narrow Wide Crank with a Microshift 11-48T Advent X cassette. Giving you an incredible 21.88″ granny gear and a 95.54″ highest gear. Combining to make a 0.79 : 3.45 gear ratio. The stack/reach ratio is around 1.48 which is not the most upright. You get a chill feel at the rear with a 440mm chainstay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It has the potential to take you on some rad adventures for only $899.99! With mounting options on the fork and those Poseidon Adventure Bars with 24 Degree Flare for extra comfort when shredding!!</p>
