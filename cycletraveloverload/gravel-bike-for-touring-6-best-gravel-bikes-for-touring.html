<p>Can you use a gravel bike for longer bicycle tours? The short answer is yes. It is completely possible. But there are a few things you need to consider before going out and purchasing a brand new gravel bike. </p>



<p>The first thing you need to figure out is what type of riding do you plan to do? 80% gravel and off-road and 20% paved? Or are you planning to ride completely on the roads?</p>



<p>That is one of the most appealing things about gravel bikes. They allow us to explore that little further, off the beaten path or road. And this is why, I think, they are so popular. </p>



<p>So it makes complete sense if you want one, over a traditional touring bike. I will discuss the differences between a touring bike and gravel bike later on. But traditional touring bikes often are only designed for pavement cycling and are often heavier with their bulletproof build. Yes you could just wack on some gravel tires on a touring bike and call it a day. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-conversion-convert-a-touring-bike-to-a-gravel-grinder/">Which still kind of works.</a></p>



<p>But the main difference is in geometry! And this is where you have to be careful when purchasing a gravel bike for touring. Often some gravel bikes have more aggressive positioning, almost like a cyclocross bike. Which is not ideal for longer days in the saddle. And if you are running panniers the bikes handling will not be tuned in as good as it could be. With the appropriate length chainstays and wheelbase. </p>



<h2>What Is A Gravel Bike?</h2>



<p>Put simply a gravel bike is the lovechild of a MTB and road bike. Built to tackle a range of different terrain and surfaces. Also know as &#8220;all-road&#8221; bikes. They have the ability to ride trails and gravel, like a mountain bike, (but not as gnarly as an actual mountain bike.) While also having enough speed to zoom down tarmac roads. Giving you the best of both worlds. </p>



<p>As the gravel bike market develops there are more options available that are more suited to road riding. And others that have more of a mountain bike pedigree in them for some of the more gnarly stuff. </p>



<p>Along with this, they are able to carry additional gear, which is perfect for bicycle touring and the geometry is mostly more relaxed for comfort when riding all day.  </p>



<p>It almost seems gravel bikes that are equipped for touring in some gnarly places are also called adventure bikes, and this is where the lines can get blurry. These are the gravel bikes with more of a MTB DNA structure! </p>



<h2>What To Look Out For In A Gravel Bike For Touring?</h2>



<p>Ideally when looking at a gravel bike for touring. You want a bike that has a balanced mix between road and mountain bike characteristics. Of course depending on your riding preferences. Gravel bikes are we suited and capable at doing the task of a touring bike if you plan to ride more gravel roads. There are however a couple of things to look out for on gravel bikes. </p>



<h3>Geometry </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-1.56.52-pm.png?resize=720%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6084" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-1.56.52-pm.png?w=1271&amp;ssl=1 1271w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-1.56.52-pm.png?resize=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-1.56.52-pm.png?resize=768%2C320&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-1.56.52-pm.png?resize=1024%2C426&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-1.56.52-pm.png?resize=50%2C21&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>First is the geometry as mentioned earlier. Avoid the likes of cyclocross bikes as they have more of a race geometry. Which means shorter, chainstay, wheelbase, trail, front center and headtube length which alters the riding completely. </p>

<p>But let&#8217;s take a look at two gravel bikes. We will compare the <strong>Canyon Grail</strong> which is known as a more aggressive and fast gravel bike. To the new <strong>2021 Kona Rove DL</strong> which in my opinion is more suited to relaxed touring. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="467" height="692" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.09.32-pm.png?resize=467%2C692&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6087" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.09.32-pm.png?w=467&amp;ssl=1 467w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.09.32-pm.png?resize=202%2C300&amp;ssl=1 202w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.09.32-pm.png?resize=34%2C50&amp;ssl=1 34w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>For all comparison purposes we use medium sized frames. But as you can see the Kona is clearly more ideal for touring. And the Grail has more of that roadie pedigree. Ideally you want a longer wheelbase for a more balanced bike when fully loaded. Along with a longer chainstay length for ample heel clearance when pedal from rear panniers. And typically a longer front centre to avoid toe clip while maneuvering a heavier rig. And ideally a lower bb height to the ground for lower centre of gravity. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="372" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.15.40-pm.png?resize=720%2C372&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6088" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.15.40-pm.png?w=961&amp;ssl=1 961w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.15.40-pm.png?resize=300%2C155&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.15.40-pm.png?resize=768%2C397&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.15.40-pm.png?resize=50%2C26&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.15.40-pm.png?resize=732%2C380&amp;ssl=1 732w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>As you can see with this frame geometry comparison (grey is the more comfortable Kona Rove) It just looks like it offers more of a upright riding position and wider stance to handle a heavier load then the Canyon Grail.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="278" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.23.59-pm.png?resize=720%2C278&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6090" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.23.59-pm.png?w=1258&amp;ssl=1 1258w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.23.59-pm.png?resize=300%2C116&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.23.59-pm.png?resize=768%2C297&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.23.59-pm.png?resize=1024%2C396&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.23.59-pm.png?resize=50%2C19&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>I am going to keep going with these real world examples. And now compare that Kona Rove, that we categorized as being a good gravel bike for touring and compare it to an actual touring bikes geometry and see the differences.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="458" height="690" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.28.21-pm.png?resize=458%2C690&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6091" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.28.21-pm.png?w=458&amp;ssl=1 458w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.28.21-pm.png?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.28.21-pm.png?resize=33%2C50&amp;ssl=1 33w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Taking a look at the 2020 Surly Disc Trucker you can see that most measurements are even more suited for more comfort, and accomodation for fully loaded gear. </p>



<p>With the longer chainstay and wheelbase along with the much longer head tube length for that super upright positioning. </p>



<p>When looking for a gravel bike for touring. The goal is to find a bike with a geometry that has a balance in the spectrum between a more aggressive, race gravel geometry and the geometry of a traditional touring bike. </p>



<h3>Gearing</h3>



<p>The other most important thing to look out for in a gravel bike that you wish to use for touring. Is the gears! How do we calculate this? Again you need to understand the type of terrain you will be riding. Lots of hills? Combined with a loaded bike. Many choices and a wide range of gear range is important, so you can just spin it out on the hills and still have enough to go down hill. Although that is not that important when it comes to touring. The gearing for hills do though! </p>



<p>Most proper touring bikes have a triple that gives you 18&#8243; to 117&#8243; gearing range. Meaning 18 inches gearing on the granny gear for climbing. ideally around that 20&#8243; on the lowest gear is perfect for loaded gravel bikes. A lot of gravel bikes fall around 25&#8243; on the lowest which isn&#8217;t really that great for touring. I have even had trouble on my &#8220;touring/gravel/adventure&#8221; bike as it only pulls around this. And struggle on the really steep mtb trails with bikepacking gear. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="446" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Kona-Rove-LTD_0.jpg?resize=720%2C446&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6094" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Kona-Rove-LTD_0.jpg?w=2239&amp;ssl=1 2239w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Kona-Rove-LTD_0.jpg?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Kona-Rove-LTD_0.jpg?resize=768%2C475&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Kona-Rove-LTD_0.jpg?resize=1024%2C634&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Kona-Rove-LTD_0.jpg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Kona-Rove-LTD_0.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Kona-Rove-LTD_0.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Looking to figure out a bikes gearing range? Times your smallest front cog/ring tooth count by the largest rear chainring tooth count. So for example if you have a Shimano GRX 810, 30/46t crank and Shimano 105 11-34t 11spd cassette. Like what&#8217;s on the 2021 Kona Rove LTD which is probably a better gravel bike for gearing more suited to touring then the Rove DL in the last example. And use a Gear Inch Calculator, like <a href="https://www.bikecalc.com/gear_inches">this one</a>. To fill out other details like tire size and width. Then you get a nice graph like this. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="689" height="599" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.52.01-pm.png?resize=689%2C599&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6092" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.52.01-pm.png?w=689&amp;ssl=1 689w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.52.01-pm.png?resize=300%2C261&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-20-at-2.52.01-pm.png?resize=50%2C43&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>23.35 inches for granny gear and 110.92 for largest gear (46&#215;11)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Then you can see in the very bottom left red box is the gearing inches for the granny gear which in this case is 30&#215;34 which is 23.35 inches. </p>



<p>When looking at gear range and ratio for a drop bar gravel bike for adventure riding and touring. 1:1 ratio is great. Low gears for a loaded bike to ride steep sections. While saving your legs for across continent tours. Ideally a gear range from 420% to 500% is nice. </p>

<p>For a bike like the 2021 Kona Rove LTD the gear range is the largest gear inches divided by the granny gear inches. So for example, 110.92 / 23.35 x 100 = <strong>475.03% gear range difference between smallest &amp; largest gears.</strong> </p>



<h3>Other Things Gravel Bikes For Touring Should Have</h3>



<p>Geometry and gearing are the main two things to look out for when considering any gravel bike for your touring adventures. Along with this having a <strong>bike frame with eyelets</strong> to mount a rear and potentially front rack for panniers is ideal. As you are touring. which is the biggest differentiator from bikepacking. Then fender mounts, and other cargo cage mounts are not musts but also a bonus. </p>



<p><strong>Bike frame material</strong> is somewhat important. Traditional touring bikes are made from steel. Which is a great material to hold up a heavy load. But they are heavy. More modern steel is lighter and often higher end steel gravel bikes are built with a carbon fork combination. You can also get carbon or aluminum or titanium. But for traditional touring, steel is real! Or in other words the most ideal. See what I did there? Read more about bike frame materials <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/all-about-bike-frame-materials/">here</a>. </p>



<p>Less important is <strong>wheels</strong> and <strong>handlebars</strong> and other components. As most gravel bikes have similar of everything here. Handlebars with some flare are more and more common on gravel bikes these days, which adds some extra comfort for longer rides which is great. Then you have mechanical or hydraulic disc brakes? Most people say touring bikes a better to have <strong>mechanical brakes</strong> as they are &#8220;easier&#8221; to service on the road. </p>



<h2>Touring Bike VS Gravel Bike</h2>



<p>So after taking an indepth look at both these bikes geometry and gearing setups. What else is different between a gravel bike and touring bike? </p>



<h3>Touring Bikes</h3>



<ul><li>Gearing is setup for the gnarliest of hills and still ride decent pace on flats.</li><li>Built mostly from steel, which is more forgiving when loaded and abused on world long adventures.</li><li>Wheels generally have around 36 spokes for added wheel strength.</li><li>Designed to be a utility vehicle with comfort for long rides rather then speed.</li><li>Always have eyelets for racks and fenders</li><li>some bikes like the Surly LHt even have mounting along the chainstay for extra spokes.</li><li>Built with less aggressive angles for greater comfort.</li><li>Somewhat limited when it comes to wider tires. Definitely better than a road bike, and comparable to some gravel bikes. But other gravel bikes can house much wider tires. </li><li>Touring bikes usually feel best with some weight on them. If you ride them naked they do handle much differently. </li></ul>



<h3>Gravel Bikes</h3>



<ul><li>Gravel bikes can vary a lot. Not designed for one type of riding. Almost a all in one type of bike. </li><li>Give you greater variety of potential adventure locations, off-road.</li><li>Made from all different materials, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ultimate-list-of-steel-gravel-bikes/">steel</a>, aluminum, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ultimate-list-of-carbon-gravel-bikes/">carbon</a>, and <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/11-best-titanium-gravel-bikes-2020/">titanium</a>.</li><li>Often wider tires, with gravel tires, that roll well on road and off road.</li><li>Can have more aggressive geometry, important to assess geometry and compared to an actual touring bike to see how it stacks up.  </li><li>Often lighter than a traditional touring bike</li><li>The best gravel bikes have found a nice medium between stretch out touring geometry and aggressive road geometry.</li><li>Perfect all rounder. </li></ul>



<h2>Best Gravel Bikes For Touring</h2>



<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look at some of the best gravel bikes for touring. In no particular order, these are some of my favorite. That offer a comfortable geometry, ability to mount for racks and panniers, and are just all around adventure machines!</p>



<p>These bikes are good for road and off-road touring. Which is what I assume you will be mostly wanting to ride. Some of them are technically categorised as touring bikes or adventure touring bikes. </p>



<p>My belief is that they are also gravel bikes at heart aso some have gravel specific drivetrains and they have a place in this category. </p>
