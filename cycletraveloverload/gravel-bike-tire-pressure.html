<p>Since coming from a roadie background this is a lesson I had to learn when making the transition to more supple tires. Typically road bike tires run 80 to 120 PSI but for gravel type tires this pressure is so much lower. In this article I am not going to be able to give you a hard and fast number that is exact. Because there are a few variables and each case will be different. </p>



<p>But the <strong>ideal range for gravel tires seems to be anywhere from 15 to 50 PSI.</strong> But even sometimes 50 is getting to the too high range for a gravel tire.</p>



<p>You need to consider your weight and bikes weight with what you are carrying (front /rear weight distribution), the width of your tire, along with the type of terrain or coarseness of gravel you intend to ride. </p>



<p>For example I was riding the Vic Divide bikepacking race on my Kona Sutra LTD and this bike runs WTB Venture 50 tires and my tire pressure had to be changed at times letting air our when attacking hardcore single track section that were rather rough, for extra suppleness and adding more suspension. When in comparison to light gravel where I like to run a higher pressure and have a harder tire for faster rolling. Ultimately your tire pressure should be in a range, changing ride to ride, considering all these different variables.  </p>



<p>So you want to test with your gravel setup and see what works for you. This may take some trial and error. But it is worth playing around with. Potentially starting near the max PSI range for your specific tires and adjusting the PSI until it feels right for you. </p>



<p>Furthermore if you are running a tubeless gravel tire setup then this means you can run a much lower tire pressure compared to when running tubes. This is one of the benefits when it comes to a tubeless tire is that ability to offer extra traction and more suspension when you come across those really technical and rough sections.</p>



<p>If you want some starting points for gravel tire pressures for different tire widths. Here are some recommendations to start from and you can always change to suit you personally. This is a range and can vary depending mostly on your weight and bike weight. Obviously the lighter you are the lower the PSI can be.</p>



<p>Also if you are bikepacking or have a load of gear on your bike. You may want to also think about running slightly different tire pressures for each tire. Potentially 2 to 4 less PSI at the front just for the slightly better control and traction under more weight. </p>



<h3>Gravel Tire Pressure Chart</h3>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Tire Width</strong></td><td><strong>PSI Range</strong></td></tr><tr><td>35 to 38 mm</td><td>35 to 40 PSI</td></tr><tr><td>40 to 45 mm</td><td>25 to 35 PSI</td></tr><tr><td>50 mm+</td><td>20 to 30 PSI</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>When figuring out the appropriate tire pressure you want a nice balance between rolling resistance and comfort. Again a good idea is to start at the high end of the PSI range for your tire width and work down from there until you find it. </p>



<p>A mistake I made when riding my 50mm Venture on my Sutra was when it came to some rocky downhill single track my pressure was around the hard 30 PSI range which was perfect for light gravel and rolled really fast. But I didn&#8217;t stop to let some air out and ended up with a puncture in the front as I slammed the wheel down on a big rock and pinched the tube. From now on I run tubeless but rue still applies for next time.  </p>



<p>But I have notice with these gravel tires that are over 40 mm there is enough room to run low pressures and still have enough air to ride efficiently and have comfort. </p>



<p>These are good standards to go by and I hope it helps you out to run a more confidant tire pressure on your gravel bike. </p>
