<p>Dropper Post are often an ideal addition to a gravel bike for some people. Obviously you could buy any gravel bike, and then get a dropper post and upgrade it. Which I honestly would recommend the most. </p>



<p>Then you are not restricted from choosing from only these bikes listed below. You can find that perfect gravel bike for whatever style of riding you plan. </p>



<p>Do gravel bikes need dropper posts?</p>



<p>It depends on what spectrum you lean towards when it comes the gravel grinding discipline. If you are more into gravel racing. Then most likely not, this would just add unnecessary weight to your bike that could slow you down. </p>



<p>But if you plan to bikepack on your gravel bike and go on fun adventures. A dropper post could be perfect. Do you plan to ride some steep and technical terrain? having the ability to lower your seatpost will help to position yourself more comfortably on bike and what better way than with a dropper? who wants to manual change the height of their seat. </p>

<p>The all new 2022 Kona Sutra LTD comes with a TranzX Dropper +RAD Internal 31.6mm seatpost. </p>



<p>The new Kona Sutra LTD takes on the DNA of the 2021 ULTD which was an upgrade or “unlimited” option compared to the 2021 LTD. They are different bikes when it comes to geometry. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/kona-rove-vs-kona-sutra-2021-models-compared/">Check out this comparison</a> of the 2021 Kona Rove vs LTD. Which compares the ULTD and LTD.</p>



<p>So Kona have gotten rid of the ULT title and now the 2022 LTD is their ultimate adventure rig! Comparing the specs of the 2022 LTD to the 2021 ULTD everything geometry wise is identical. The only difference I could find was slightly bigger disk rotors on the 2022 model. Using the SRAM Centerline 180mm compared to 160mm. Also they got rid of the guard around the front crank which adds to its cool points.</p>

<p>The Specialized S-Works Diverge bike comes with the X-Fusion Manic Dropper with 50mm travel. </p>



<p>Specialized have innovated again and made some more changes to their new Diverge line up. With many options to choose from for each budget level. The ultimate all rounder gravel bike.</p>



<p>“We tossed gravel geometry ‘status-quo’ out the window. The new Diverge has the most progressive geometry we’ve ever created for a drop bar bike, giving riders a capable and stable bike in the dirt, that still feels responsive and nimble on the road. We’ve increased the frame’s reach, introduced a slacker head tube and a longer offset fork. All this creates incredible confidence with a planted feeling in the dirt, while spec’ing shorter stems keeps the overall cockpit length the same and the steering lively. We’ve kept the bike’s BB low to increase stability, but high enough to utilize with 650b wheels if that’s your jam.”</p>



<p>The new Diverge has space for up to 47mm tires with a 700c wheel and 2.1” with a 650b wheel.</p>
