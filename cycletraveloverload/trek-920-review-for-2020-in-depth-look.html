<p>The Trek 920 is the ultimate adventure bike that is made from a all aluminum base. A 100 Series Alpha aluminum frame with rack &amp; fender mounts plus as you can see you get the racks to. With a 920 alloy disc adventure fork. Overall it is great value for money with some nice Shram GX high-end components. </p>

<p>When I first set my eyes on this beast of a adventure bike, it just speaks &#8220;please take me on a great adventure.&#8221; Especially when I saw this photo of the Trek 920 below, all loaded up and ready to go. I just looks stunning! </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="564" height="398" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/53ff816ef47759b90656ec294f3e8fb3.jpg?resize=564%2C398&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4135" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/53ff816ef47759b90656ec294f3e8fb3.jpg?w=564&amp;ssl=1 564w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/53ff816ef47759b90656ec294f3e8fb3.jpg?resize=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/53ff816ef47759b90656ec294f3e8fb3.jpg?resize=50%2C35&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>It comes with a 2&#215;10 Sram Drivetrain that is set for many conditions of terrain, the large range of gears puts it right up there, geared about the same as similar bikes for riding up hills. However, similar bikes won‘t keep up with the Trek 920 while riding downhill or sprinting. </p>



<p>It is one of those bikes that you take with you, when you plan to explore off-road terrain but still want the capability to haul all your gear like you would on a traditional road touring bike setup. </p>

<p>Although it is marketed as a adventure bike, it is so much more then that. Thanks to its carrying abilities you can use it as a commuter. If you are looking for a bikepacking bike that is a good starting point to. </p>



<h2>Great Things About The 920</h2>



<ul><li>A very versatile bike that can keep up for a large variety of different uses, from commuting and pulling a trailer around town, to bikepacking overnighters and even a long tour. </li><li>Also on versatility you could change out the standard Bontrager XR1, 29&#215;2.00&#8221; tyres that come with the bike and replace them for up to a 29×2.25” tire. This is the max clearance and ay depend on the type of tire. </li><li>The bike runs smooth and has very stable handling which is exactly want you want on a bike like this. </li></ul>



<h2>Not So Great Things About The 920</h2>



<ul><li>The standard tyres that come with this bike are not the best. Many users of this bike have mentioned that they swapped out the old ones.</li><li>Depending on what size bike you get and the overall fit. Some have mentioned that the stem on their 54cm was too long and made them feel stretched out on the bike. </li><li>The front rack on this bike on first impression was it looks really cool. However some have mentioned that it is &#8220;useless since it places the center of gravity for front bags much too high&#8221; (the front rack of the Trek 520 is much better) but I guess it depends on how you like your bike to handle. </li><li>Some owners of this bike have also mentioned that the handlebars are not the best and could be replaced. The Bontrager Race VR-C, 31.8mm handlebars that come with the bike, are okay. But I would probably replace them for something like a flared drop bar. Especially if you are going gravel and forest terrain, that extra flare helps for better control of the bike. </li></ul>



<h2>Keep These Things In Mind</h2>



<ul><li>The bike is made from aluminum which is a material that is not as common when it comes to touring bikes. As they are commonly made from steel or titanium as they are stronger materials. </li><li>But due to aluminum being used it does make they bike a little lighter, at 12kg. </li><li>There are a lot of complaints about the components that come on this bike. Some think they are not the best and it is probably worth upgrading or forgetting about this bike because of them. The bike uses SRAM GX groupset, while some have had minor problems other also have been fine with it. </li></ul>



<h3>Build Kit</h3>



<p>Breaking apart what makes up a bike is a good step to understanding the bikes overall quality and how well it stands up to other options you might be looking at. </p>



<h4>Frameset</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="416" height="259" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-1-1.jpeg?resize=416%2C259&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4139" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-1-1.jpeg?w=416&amp;ssl=1 416w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-1-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-1-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Trek 920 frame is made from a 100 Series Alpha aluminum with rack &amp; fender mounts and a 142x12mm thru axle. The built in mounts make it easy for you to add racks and fenders if you need. The bike does already comes with racks. The Bontrager Carry Forward Front Rack and the Bontrager BackRack Deluxe. The frame has a 920 alloy disc adventure front fork with a 15mm thru axle. You also get the option for DupTrap S Integration, with allows you to add a bluetooth or ANT+ sensor in your frame to track rides. </p>



<h4>Components</h4>



<p>There are a few components to go through for this Trek 920, the idea behind mentioning what this bike is made up of hopefully will make things clear for you so you can do further research to see if these components are of good standard. But generally with any new bike the standard saddle gets replaced. This bike comes with the Bontrager Evoke saddle. A Bontrager alloy, 27.2mm, 12mm offset, 330mm length seatpost. As mentioned before the Bontrager Race VR-C, 31.8mm handlebars with Bontrager Supertack Perf tape. Depending on what size bike you get it comes with different length stems. All of which are Bontrager Elite or Bontrager Elite Basic at 31.8mm and 7 degrees. Varying from 80mm length for size 49cm to 110mm length for the 61cm. A FSA Integrated, sealed cartridge bearing, 1-1/8&#8221; top, 1.5&#8221; bottom headset and 160mm brake rotor. </p>



<h4>Drivetrain</h4>



<p>The bike is powered by SRAM S700, 2-speed and SRAM S700, 10 speed shifters which offer a great range of gears, especially for those steep accents when fully loaded. The front derailleur is a SRAM X5, 34.9mm clamp and the rear a SRAM GX, Type 2, long cage. With the crank it comes in two different lengths separated by 5mm. On the 49, 52, 54 sizes you get a 170mm length, ProWheel forged alloy, 2-piece, 44/30T crank. And the same for the 56, 58, 61 sizes only difference is this comes in at a 175mm length. Bottom bracket is a Sealed cartridge, GXP Type. The Trek 920 sees the use of a SRAM PG-1030, 11-36, 10 speed cassette and KMC X10, 10 speed chain. </p>



<h4>Wheels</h4>



<p>The front wheels that comes with bike are the Bontrager Duster Elite, Tubeless Ready, 100x15mm thru axle and the rear are Bontrager Duster Elite, Tubeless Ready, 142&#215;12 thru axle. </p>



<h3>Geometry</h3>



<p>Compared to something like the Surly LHT touring bike this Trek 920 has a fairly long chain-stay and wheelbase. One of the bigger differences is the BB Drop is much lower for this Trek making it have a lower centre of gravity. even when compared to something like the 2020 Giant ToughRoad SLR GX 1 Drop Bar it is still lower. </p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Overall the Trek 920 is one of those bikes that is on my list for a true adventure bike that is not only capable of epic bicycle adventures but also daily commuting and whatever else you may want to throw its way. Potential for wide tires, relaxed adventure geometry for comfort over the long haul but stills allows for great handling. It is a bike that calls for adventure. And it is one of the better choices out there. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=0d15472d-796a-41f7-afb4-32437118891b&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fbikes%2Fadventure-touring-bikes%2F920%2F920%2Fp%2F21996%2F%3FcolorCode%3Dtan">You can pick up the new 2020 model at Trek.com for a sale price of </a><strong><a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=0d15472d-796a-41f7-afb4-32437118891b&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fbikes%2Fadventure-touring-bikes%2F920%2F920%2Fp%2F21996%2F%3FcolorCode%3Dtan">$1,899.99</a></strong></p>
