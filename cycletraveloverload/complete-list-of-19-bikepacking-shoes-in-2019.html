<p>In this post we are going to be looking at many different potential shoe options for bikepakcing, on clipless setups and flat pedal setups. As not every rider only likes clipless there are others out there who prefer a more laid back flat pedal system. </p>



<p>When looking for a appropriate bikepacking shoe there needs to be a nice blend between the perfect shoe for riding and the perfect shoe for hiking. Somewhere between both seems like a great shoe that will be best suited for the demands of bikepacking. </p>

<h3>What makes a great bikepacking shoe?</h3>



<p>When Bikepacking you often want a quality shoe that provides many of the characteristics listed below, such as, ventilation and comfort. Something that is clipless, but also provide flexibility and comfort when hiking your bike. As bikepacking shoes need to be multi purpose. To also provide comfort and efficiency while riding also. </p>



<h4>On Bike Comfort</h4>



<p>As you are riding your bike for hours on end, for multiple days consecutively. Riding performance and comfort is very important. So you want a shoe that is comfortable for your foot. The closure system and sole stiffness are two important factors to evaluate the most comfortable shoes for bikepacking and touring. </p>



<h4>Off Bike Comfort and Hiking Comfort</h4>



<p>When bikepacking you are often faced with challenging terrain that give you no option but to get off and push your bike. Mixed in with fatigued legs and rough ground, you need a shoe that is going to be comfortable when in such situations. The qualities great bikepacking shoes should have are. </p>



<ul><li>Rubberized sole with traction</li><li>The sole of the shoe should be somewhat flexible</li><li>The footbed area of the shoe should have some extra padding</li><li>Slightly broader footprint for greater stability and more traction.</li></ul>



<p>A great bikepacking shoe sole should be in a fine medium between, to hard that it is difficult to hike and so flexible that sustain pedalling becomes uncomfortable. </p>



<h4>Breathability and Ventilation </h4>



<p>Ultimately you want shoes that are breathable, as you don&#8217;t want to be suffocating them all day when it is very hot. Some shoe manufacturers design shoes with enough breathable fabric in the upper section, do be just fine. However, some also only allow minimal breathability which is great in keeping your feet warm in the winter months, but very hot in hotter times of the year. </p>



<h4>Durability </h4>



<p>Durability is a bit factor in choosing the best bikepacking shoes, as most hike-a-bike shoe options are great for standing up to the use on a bike. But the fall short in the hiking use. The bottoms often end up falling apart and rubber soles wear down. While also the top half of some shoes also fail to stand up to the demands of bikepacking. </p>



<h4>Looking for Gravel Bike Shoes?</h4>



<p>Before we get into the best bikepacking shoes <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-gravel-bike-shoes/">here are some gravel shoe options that might be some other great options to consider.</a> </p>



<h4>Or What About Bicycle Touring Shoes?</h4>



<p>Maybe you are thinking between bike touring and bikepacking. If you are planning to head off on some long term bike adventure <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/bicycle-touring-shoes-best-shoes-for-bike-touring/">some of the shoes in this article</a> offer comfort and a more laid-back approach to cycling footwear. More for someone who is not one for cleats and clipless. </p>

<p>If you head over to my <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/recommended-bikepacking-gear/">recommended bikepacking gear page</a>, you will see that these are the shoes I recommend. The Quoc Gran Tourer gravel shoes are the ultimate bike shoe for mixed-terrain riding and those off-road terrains. The shoe is extremely comfortable for those section that require walking with your bike. The Gravel Grip sole works well at adding extra grip on a range of surfaces, while the grip does not clog really at all even in muddy conditions. </p>



<p>These shoes also do a good job at keeping your feet dry. Thanks to the tongue and “no-sew” splashproof upper they are essentially waterproof from the upper part of the shoe. The exposed cleat area is also fully waterproof and fits MTB cleats. A style bikepacking shoe that comes in a few different colour and design options. These gravel bike shoes can handle just about any conditions you through its way, including trails, tarmac and off-bike exploring. Priced <a href="https://quoc.cc/collections/gravel-bike-shoes/products/quoc-gt-black-camo-2017"><em>from</em> £199.00 GBP</a></p>

<p><strong>The Adidas Trail Cross SL Shoe seems like the ultimate; hike, bike and even everyday shoe. </strong></p>



<p>Many riders report these shoes to be very nice. And they are really cool looking shoes I must admit. They are a little bit more supportive then shoes like the Freeriders, despite having the same rubber compound. They are a little more efficient when pedal due to a stiffer sole. But the sole is not that stiff allowing them to still be good walking shoes. The stealth rubber on the sole is &#8220;Adidas Five Ten or 5.10&#8221;. Which generates awesome grip on pedals and other rough surfaces when hiking, like rocks. <strong>Price $91.00</strong></p>



<h2 style="text-align:left">Other Adidas Terrex Options</h2>



<p>I am a favourite of shoes that have gore-tex technology. It is a industry standard. Here below are some other option of the Terrex range that are slightly different to the shoes mentioned above. But should still be great for bikepacking. </p>

<p>This 2FO Cliplite shoe is a great lightweight clipless shoe at 347 grams with performance features and nice styling. </p>



<p>The stiff bottoms of this shoe provide high performance pedalling and some off bike comfort. </p>



<p>They feel stable and comfortable when walking and are not overly heavy like some other trail shoes shoes out there. On first thought there was some worry that these shoes would take some time to wear in, however they were very comfortable from the first ride. </p>



<p>They are not the most breathable shoes on the market, resulting in hot and sweaty feet. But they are good for winter shoes. The bottom sole of the shoe is a hard rubber and is not that grippy for hike a bike, on the rocks. Could do with a softer rubber. <strong><a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FSpecialized-2Fo-Cliplite-MTB-Shoes">Price $179.99</a></strong></p>

<p>The Five Ten clipless Kestrel shoe has some good usability with a hike-friendly outsole. pedalling efficiency is optimised with a stiff bottom. One of the more appealing factors of these shoes is the slimmer profile than most other shoes. </p>



<p>These shoes could be a little lighter, The Boa fastener may feel a little tight in some areas of the shoe.

<p>The Scott Elite BOA look like racing shoes but don&#8217;t let their appearance fool you. They are actually much more comfortable then they may look. When wearing them they often feel like you are not wearing shoes at all. </p>



<p>These could be one of the better clipless shoes out there for hike-a-bike sections. The sole is quite flexible but not too flexible, just enough for comfort when hiking. The tread is aggressive which is also great for hiking and preventing any slipping. The SPD sits deep into the base of the shoe, which results in minimal damage, and extra comfort when hiking.</p>



<p>One small issue that is possible with these shoes but not proven is over time the velcro strap at the front of the shoes could begin to loosen over time, making the fit a little off. <a href="https://amzn.to/2LDGZCr"> </a><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2LDGZCr">Price from $79.99</a></strong></p>

<p>The fit of these Elevates is slightly relaxed with enough room in the shoe box for some wiggle. 3/4 of the bottom of the shoe is made from carbon and nylon resulting in a pretty strong base. Providing enough comfort for hike-a-bike parts of your bikepakcing adventures. Furthermore on the sole of the shoes. They are made from a EVA midsole and a Vibram Megagrip outsole. With plenty of grip around the SPD cleat mounts. </p>



<p>With the Boa IP1 tension dial and velcro strap, creates a smooth and even comfort all around the shoe. Meaning no pressure points to worry about. </p>



<p>Overall, these are a great shoe for someone looking for durability and a shoe you can abuse. This shoe does lack in the ventilation aspect. With only a few spots on the side of the shoe where some airflow comes through. Some users also mentioned that the fit runs a little small and is sometimes to narrow. <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/30aqGpV">Price $180.00</a></strong></p>

<p>These MT7 shoes are quite stylish and look more like a hiking shoe as they are advertised on Shimano&#8217;s site. They are great for short walking and seem to maintain comfort for these shorter activities, however they are not exactly independent hiking shoes. </p>



<p>This shoe only has a Boa fastener and no additional velcro strap, however the Boa on these shoes work very well. The SPD cleat also sits back into the shoe which is a great feature for the multi use these shoes are intended to be used for. </p>



<p>One of the great things about these shoes is there breathability. They have multi points around the shoe for sufficient airflow through out the warm times of the year or for those who get hot feet, they will suit just fine.

<p>This Scott shoe is more suited the enduro scene and is a capable shoe for off-road riding, it is not the best option out there for hike-a-bike though. </p>



<p>I am a fan however of the style and design of these shoes, how cool does that camo look? </p>



<p>Very durable shoes, however, one of the downsides to this shoe are the absence of enough padding near the insole. After long days in the saddle this can result in fatigued feet. </p>



<p>Another thing about these shoes is the ankle protects padding that see the side wall of the shoe raise slightly, as you can see in the photo above, there are reports of this resulting in some rubbing on the foot, but not enough to cause any chafing. </p>



<p>The shoes also have somewhat of a heel lift, which is not ideal for hiking and they are also a bit stiff for hiking. Another thing is the tongue needs a little more padding. <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/32TO87z">Price $179.99</a></strong></p>

<p>These shoes look more light a hiking shoes then anything to do with cycling. And this is where these shoe shine best is when hiking on trails and hike-a-bike. But they seem to be a little bulky when using them for riding. The sole is quiet rigid. These shoe also lack in ventilation and breathability as the gore-tex seems to trap any water that may get into the shoes taking a while for them to dry out. <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/30aHigg">From $150.00</a></strong></p>

<p>This shoe looks incredible in my opinion, however it is the most expensive shoe in this list at around $250. And is only really suited best for on bike riding. Not the best shoe for hiking and extended walking. Best suited for dirt touring and road biking style of touring. Due to a stiff sole section of the shoe. </p>



<h3>Reasons to try flat pedals / shoes for bikepacking and touring</h3>



<p>There are some reasons why you may want to use flat pedal or normal shoe options compared to going clip-less. </p>



<ul><li>You may feel uncomfortable or not as confident with having your shoes fixed onto your pedals, with a heavy and cumbersome loaded bike. I know when I first tried using clipless shoes just on a road bike. I fell of a few times and it was a little frightening the first few moments when trying to learn how to ride with them. Again depending on your confidence level they may or may not suit you. </li><li>Using flats it is one less thing to worry about. When you are not clipped in your are able to quickly but your foot down to avoid a crash or save yourself if you are unbalanced. </li><li>Using flat pedals is harder work, this is one of the main reasons to use clipless. As you are not as efficient when riding and using your energy more resourcefully. However, there could be reason to believe that flats train you and work your legs more, making you a stronger rider. </li><li>The main reason I like to use flat pedals is the convenience and laid back nature of them when bike travelling. I don&#8217;t like to feel like a road racer when I am travelling across a country. Maybe this is a personal thing as I started biking in the road cycling space and we always used clipless. quick story, I actually remember the first day I did a bunch ride, I rolled up with sneaker and hood pedals, they all laughed at me! </li><li>But at the end of the day it is what you fell best in and what works for you. </li></ul>



<h3>Flat Pedal Shoes For Bikepakcing and Touring</h3>



<p>It seems difficult to find flat pedal bikepakcing shoe options that are actually designed for bikepacking in mind. However, if you wish to go the clipless route. There are many different options of hiking, trail running shoes or even sandals and good old thongs. </p>



<p>There are some downsides to wearing more casual shoes when bikepacking or touring. I have tested trail running shoes, like very minimalist Vibram five fingers which over some time do get chewed up by the pins on the pedals, same goes with thongs. </p>



<p><strong>The list below are the shoes other riders use for a flat pedal shoe setups</strong> <strong>when bikepakcing and touring.</strong></p>

<p>The Freerider Contact are lightweight shoes that are great at keeping your feet dry. But they do have some durability issues. If you see the video below,  you can see how terrible these shoes held up. </p>



<p>However this shoe performs well and is comfortable but again it lacks the durability that the next Five Ten shoe provides. It seems the more original Freerider shoes are better for longevity. </p>

<p>The Five Teen Freeriders are really nice looking shoes, they kind of remind me of old school skating shoes. The shoe is made with a heavy canvas, especially around the side of the ankle area, providing great protection. Also has double stitching all over the shoe. The sole is attached with thick stitching to the main body of the shoe. All in all resulting in a very durable shoe. </p>



<p>The sole of the shoes is very rigid and solid, the heel of the shoe is very stiff and hard, but the shoe still has some flexibility enabling some movement to make it comfortable when walking. However they are not the best shoes in the list for hike-a-bike, as the stiff bottom is not the most comfortable.<strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/32QqzMW">Price From $90.00</a></strong></p>

<p>Five Ten describes this shoes as &#8216;the ultimate all-round multi-sport approach shoe&#8221;.</p>



<p>The Aescent seems to have merged all there different models into making this one shoe. making them more versatile overall. It preforms better compared to the Freeriders (which are next in the list), as the Aescent has a more flexible bottom making walking and hike-a-bike much more comfortable. </p>



<p>However, the bottoms of the Aescent don&#8217;t have much of a lug pattern. Making these shoes traction-less on wet and muddy terrain. <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/30aHHiM">Price From $112.07</a></strong></p>

<p>This new edition 2FO has a new and improved impact zone platform (the light blue mid-sole in the picture above). Which was developed with a series of pressure mapping exercises for real riding situations to develop this shoe. </p>



<p>The SlipNot™ 2.0 rubber compound sole material is designed to allow the shoe to have more movability while on the pedals. The sole is also a little more stiffer then the 1.0 model that is more forgiving then previous years. The inside has a nice body geometry sole. </p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/30aHYSQ">Keen Newport h2 sandals</a>, which offer great breathability and adequate structure for protecting your feet while also having tread adding traction. Generic flip flops or thongs, are other options of footwear other riders all use on there adventures. Some say they are crazy, and it would be impractical and uncomfortable to wear thongs. I can say from experience it is not the best option, but I have done it. </p>



<h2>Pedal Straps</h2>



<p>Pedal Straps and flat pedals is a alternative to think about if you don&#8217;t want to go for a clipless setup. Something like the <a href="https://amzn.to/32TjTha">Power Grips pedal straps</a> have been around, offering strap for flat pedal setups. Or you could just have a shop around on Amazon for some cheaper and easier fitting options. </p>

<p>I am current using these <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/30evkDh">Ecco Biom</a></strong><a href="https://amzn.to/30evkDh"> </a>lightweight shoes. That have nice tread at the bottoms and are also flexible and great for hiking. I feel I have trained my feet to put up with strain from not so flexible &#8220;cycling shoe options&#8221; like riding in thongs for 1000&#8217;s of km. That these shoes work for me. </p>



<h4>Bikepacking Spare Shoes and Camp Shoes / Evening Footwear</h4>



<p>When selecting a shoe for use during the down time from riding all day and when you are relaxing around the campfire. You need to have in mind that you will be carting these spare shoes around on your bike, so preferably they need to pack down small taking up little volume on your bike, and are overall comfortable. </p>



<p>Some cheap <a href="https://amzn.to/31DDuSb">plimsolls shoes</a> are the type fo shoe that riders use, or something like a <a href="https://amzn.to/32RWQmQ">Vibram Five Fingers</a> is what I would personally recommended. <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ob04O9">Crocs</a> are very lightweight and can even be attached to the outside of your bike. Same goes with some flip flops to. </p>
