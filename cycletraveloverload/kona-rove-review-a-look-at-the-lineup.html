<p>By now I am becoming a big fan of Kona bikes! I currently own the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/kona-sutra-ltd-review-bikepacking-bike/">2020 Kona Sutra LTD adventure/gravel bike</a> it is so capable! I recommend you head over to the linked article and have a more in-depth look at that bike. But it is more expensive compared to most of the Rove options. </p>



<p>So Kona have six different Rove models in their 2020 line up. We are going to look at all of them to see which one would suit you the best! But also go deep into reviewing the more popular KONA ROVE NRB DL model. The 2019 bike can be picked up over at Jenson USA for $1,599.99 with all the current sales! That is a deal considering the retail price is around $2,299. That is a saving of $699!</p>



<h3>What Has Changed Since 2019?</h3>



<p>For 2020 Kona have released a new fleet of Rove bikes. So what is the differences between the Kona Rove NRB DL 2019 and the new 2020 model?</p>



<p>One of the main differences I noticed was the NRB DL 2020 features Kona&#8217;s new full carbon flat mount disc fork, featuring three-pack cage mounts on either side. While the 2019 has no mounting eyelets at all on the fork. This adds another whole dimension of bikepacking versatility, for carrying gear. </p>



<p>The new 2020 model is also spec&#8217;d out with the high-end Shimano GRX 800, GRX 600 groupset. Last years model Shimano Ultegra 105 is still high-end and more then capable. They are both 2&#215;11 speeds! However the front crank on the 2020 is 30/46t while the 2019 is 34/50t. While the rear cassette is still the same for both bikes with the Shimano 105 11-34t 11spd.</p>



<p>The tires and rims are still the same with WTB Horizon Road Plus TCS 650x47c tires and WTB Asym i23 TCS rims. The only difference with the wheels is the 2020 has Shimano 105 hubs while the 2019 has Formula hubs but they are still the same sizes. Oh, yeah and still the same Shimano RT54 160mm disk rotors. </p>

<p>To be honest nothing really has changed that much. The geometry for both bikes are identical. Just some groupset &#8216;upgrades&#8217; really. Definitely not enough in my opinion to spend an extra $700 for a 2020 model. If I was in the market for a gravel grinder I would really consider the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FKona-Rove-NRB-DL-Bike-2019"><a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FKona-Rove-NRB-DL-Bike-2019">KONA ROVE NRB DL 2019 for only $1,599.99 at Jenson USA</a></a><a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FKona-Rove-NRB-DL-Bike-2019">!</a></p>



<h3>More About The KONA ROVE NRB DL</h3>



<p>It makes a great commuter, road and gravel grinder. The wide 47c tires do a good job at dampening the road vibrations, and really mute the impacts from rough roads. </p>



<p>So the bike comes in a Kona 6061 Aluminum Butted frame and carbon fork build. And it ships stock with those 650b tires that are 47mm wide. Along with the nice blue tone that bike has going on it has some nice touches when it comes to graphics. As you can see on the inside of the fork. It has rear rack capability and inside the front fork it has braze-ons for fenders. That is the thing with this 2019 model there is no eyelets for racks of any kind. </p>



<p>When it comes to tire clearance there is a little space for some slightly larger tires if you want to go that way. Potentially fitting up to 50mm if you wanted to try. </p>



<h3>Things Good About The Bike</h3>



<p>The aesthetics on this bike are good, some say t is on point. But for me it works. That Robins Egg Shell Blue does look rather nice if I do say myself. It is also a generally fun riding bike! It is more in the middle with some other bikes like it. More like a racer feel, not as quick and responsive to handle like the Surly Straggler or Midnight Special. It is a stable bike for long endurance gravel rides, or shorter bikepacking trips. </p>



<h3>Not So Good Things</h3>



<p>The gearing on the 2019 does not quiet work as well as the sub compact 2020 models 30/46. I you are looking for this bike for a fun road bike, and not so much gravel then the gearing should be fine. And then you have the fork on the 2019 which lacks utility. </p>



<h3>Different Models Of The Kona Rove</h3>



<p>There are so many different models of the Kona Rove that it is no reason for it to be rather overwhelming. So My goal with this section of the review is to breakdown each bike so you can better understand its intended use and comparison of the specs and kit of the bikes. So hopefully by the end of this article you can make a informed purchasing decision.  </p>



<h4>Kona Rove 2020</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="420" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove.jpg?resize=720%2C420&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4965" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove.jpg?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove.jpg?resize=768%2C449&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove.jpg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you are on a tight budget and looking for a sub $1000 bike. This full aluminum built gravel/road bike might be worth looking into. The basic of Rove options available. With 700c x 37mm WTB Riddler Comp tires. You get Kona&#8217;s basic offerings, with a modest Shimano Claris groupset. The sees a 2&#215;8 with a 34/50t crank and cassette of Shimano HG50 11-34t. Price is $849 retail. </p>



<h4>Kona Rove DL 2020</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="413" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_dl.jpg?resize=720%2C413&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4967" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_dl.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_dl.jpg?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_dl.jpg?resize=768%2C440&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_dl.jpg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This Rove DL is the other full alloy option like the entry level Rove. It is essentially the same bike but with slightly upgraded components and fenders. You get a 2&#215;9 Shimano Sora groupset with the same sized crank and cassette. But you get a 9 speed over the 8 speed here. Still mechanical disk brakes but different brand. Coming in at $1,099.00</p>



<h4>Kona Rove ST 2020</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="428" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_st.jpg?resize=720%2C428&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4964" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_st.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_st.jpg?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_st.jpg?resize=768%2C457&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_st.jpg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Kona Rove ST is a badass bike for road but you can also take it on gravel and trails. It is ideal if you are looking for a steel urban commuter, but also want to hit some off-road on your way to work. It does come stock with 650b x 47mm tires. They are the WTB Ventures which have some off-road capabilities. And  SRAM Rival 1x drivetrain with a 40t X-Sync crank, and SRAM PG1130 11-42t 11spd cassette. You get the TRP Spyre C Flat Mount mechanical disc brakes on this rig. Retail price is at 1,599.00</p>



<h4>Kona Rove NRB 2020</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="421" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_nrb.jpg?resize=720%2C421&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4968" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_nrb.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_nrb.jpg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_nrb.jpg?resize=768%2C449&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_nrb.jpg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Rove NRB is a alloy frame and carbon fork build. You get the same Kona Rove Verso Full Carbon Flat Mount Disc fork as the NRB DL. This bike does feature the SRAM Apex 1&#215;11 gravel setup. With a 40t X-Sync crank and SRAM PG1130 11-42t cassette. But you only get mechanical brakes not hydraulic like the NRB DL. Tires are WTB Horizon Road Plus TCS 650x47c and the bike retails for $1,799.00</p>



<h4>Kona Rove NRB DL 2020</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="440" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_nrb_dl.jpg?resize=720%2C440&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4970" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_nrb_dl.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_nrb_dl.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_nrb_dl.jpg?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rove_nrb_dl.jpg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Then we have the new 2020 Rove NRB DL. As stated earlier it has gearing that just works better then 2019&#8217;s model and it has the versatile fork with x3 braze-ons either side. Along with this you get hydraulic disc brakes (so does the Rove Swift). And you get the 2&#215;10 speed Shimano GRX 800, GRX 600 groupset. Retailing for $2,299.00</p>



<h4>Kona Swift Rove 2020</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="441" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/swift_rove.jpg?resize=720%2C441&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4966" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/swift_rove.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/swift_rove.jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/swift_rove.jpg?resize=768%2C470&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/swift_rove.jpg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>I am a big fan of this bike! A adventure ready machine! For this bike Kona have taken the all steel frame of the Rove ST and replaced the components with that of the Rove NRB DL. Chucked on some stylish Swift bags and here you have a bike ready for a bike adventure! Doesn&#8217;t it look so nice?</p>



<p>It is ready to go for a bike tour! You even get stock the Brooks B17 Imperial saddle and even Brooks Leather Bar Tape. This bike is a 650b with hydraulic disk brakes. And you get the high-end Shamino GRX 800, GRX 600 groupset. Wth the same crank and cassette numbers as the NRB DL. Such a dreamy bike, that I so want! Only 201 Swift Roves exist, so they’re sure to be a collector’s item! This bike retails for $3,199.00</p>
