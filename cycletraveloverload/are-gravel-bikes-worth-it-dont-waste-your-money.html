<p>Most cases, yes!! gravel bikes are worth it? But why you ask? They could be the ultimate bike which does it all. From the group road rides with your mates, to single track adventures across a country! They also make great commuter bikes. </p>



<p>But the problem with a bike that does it all, means it does everything poorly. Is this true? I guess it depends on the type of gravel bike you are looking at. If you can find that gravel bike that ticks all the boxes then you can just about say with 100% certainty that it will be worth it for you. </p>



<p>But what makes a gravel bike worth it? Well if you plan to do all that was mentioned above and even more. You will have to consider many different variables when choosing that perfect gravel bike. Why are gravel bikes worth it?</p>



<p>Also note that if you want to just ride gnarly singletrack and that solely then a MTB is obviously your best bet. However if you are looking for a bike to offer variety, you know the spice of life to yours, then the humble gravel bike could be just your ticket to such freedom! </p>



<h4>These types of gravel bikes are worth it! </h4>



<p>Again it really depends on what you intend to use your gravel bike for mostly. To see if it truely is worth it for you and your personal riding desires. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ultimate-list-of-the-fastest-gravel-bikes-gravel-race-bikes/"><strong>fast and lightweight gravel bike</strong></a> is perfect for those looking to stay ahead of the pack on group ride with roadie mates. But also offering you the ability to ride loose gravel and light single-track. Some are perfect for those long bikepacking adventures or cross continent races! These <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-road-gravel-bikes-adventure-road-bikes-the-ultimate-list/"><strong>road gravel bikes &amp; adventure road bikes</strong></a> are all worth checking out also. </p>



<p>In my book a bike that can tick as many boxes as possible is worth it. Allowing you to explore, race, commute, and more. The <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/3t-exploro-full-aero-gravel-bike-should-you-get-it/"><strong>3T Exploro</strong></a> one of the most aero gravel bikes on the market. Is a fine example of a bike that is fast, lightweight, decent tire clearance for rougher terrain and comfortable geometry for multi-day bike adventures. </p>



<p>These bikes offer frame stiffness with performance riding as a main focus. With an agile and responsive ride feeling offering just a little more than a road bike. If you are after a bike that is light they also weigh around 9.5kg or less. Also <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ultimate-list-of-carbon-gravel-bikes-2/"><strong>carbon gravel bikes</strong></a> offering some of the lightest gravel bike builds if lightweight is a main priority. Looking for the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/cheapest-carbon-gravel-bikes/"><strong>cheapest carbon gravel bikes?</strong></a></p>



<p>Maybe you are looking for a versatile commuter bike? These are some of the <strong><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bikes-for-commuting-best-commuter-gravel-bikes/">best commuter gravel bikes</a></strong>. Perfect for those looking for a gravel bike to cruise around town or the daily commute to work. But that also means the less travelled commute! The off-road commute when the conditions are not always smooth! It is worth noting that adventure focus gravel bikes make good commuter bikes. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-flat-bar-gravel-bikes/"><strong>Flat bar gravel bikes</strong></a> also make ideal commuter bikes. </p>



<p>That leads me to the most important thing a gravel bike can offer. Here at Cycle Travel Overload we are all about exploring by bicycle! So a gravel bike that is built for adventure is so damn worth it. Allowing you to explore new and unseen places is worth ever dollar. </p>



<p><strong><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-for-bikepacking/">Bikepacking gravel bikes</a></strong> offer relaxed geometry and riding position making it much more comfortable to ride for days on end. While also including ample mounting options for gear and wide clearance for fatter rubber for that extra comfort and making the bike go just about where ever you want. </p>



<p>If you are from a bicycle touring background and want to get more into gravel riding. <strong><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-for-touring-6-best-gravel-bikes-for-touring/">These bikes</a></strong> make good gravel bikes for touring. </p>



<p><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/top-8-drop-bar-mountain-bikes/"><strong>Drop bar mountain bikes</strong></a> is another term used to describe gravel bikes which are truely capable. And <strong><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/15-best-monstercross-bikes-650b-gravel-bikes-in-2020/">monster-cross bikes</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Often times <strong><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ultimate-list-of-steel-gravel-bikes/">steel gravel bikes</a></strong> are some of the best bikes to look for when it comes to adventure. Also <strong><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/11-best-titanium-gravel-bikes/">titanium gravel bikes</a></strong> are sometimes not worth it as it can be an expensive material, however some of the best adventure focused gravel bikes are made from Ti.  </p>



<p>Some of the best gravel bikes that a worth it are bikes that offer great value for money. Yes some of the bikes I have mentioned can be expensive but worth is subjective. But if you are on the budget and looking to stretch your money the furtherest to get a great value gravel bike <strong><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-value-gravel-bikes/">these are some great options.</a></strong> There is one bike that is worth $899.99 and in my opinion is better then some bikes double the price. The <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/marin-nicasio-review-best-budget-gravel-bike/"><strong>Marin Nicasio</strong></a> is also another budget friendly gravel bike worth checking out. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Overall I would say gravel bikes are worth. After all <strong><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/kona-sutra-ltd-review-bikepacking-bike/">my personal bike</a></strong> is a gravel bike, which allows me to go on overnight bikepacking trips, around the world multi-month long adventures, commuting around town to sending down some of the most challenging MTB trails in my area. Although the last one is a bit rough my bike can still do it! </p>
