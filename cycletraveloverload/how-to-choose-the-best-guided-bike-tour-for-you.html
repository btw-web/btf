<p>I have always had a fascination with guided or self-guided bike tours, they seem to be a great way to get started with bicycle touring. And to learn from those who know what they are doing. </p>



<p>There are many guided bike tours to suit almost anyone, it is just a matter of choosing the right one for you. Below I will talk about most of the things you should consider when picking the best guided or self-guided bike tour for your next trip. <strong>Things you should consider are; who is running the company, what are their reviews like, what is included in the package and do you have special requirements. </strong></p>

<p>Quick story</p>



<p>I was once on a bicycle tour, and I was on the side of the road as the sunset, fixing a flat. Then a lady pulled up in her VW Caddy. And invited me to stay at her house for the night, cooked me dinner and I was well rested for the next day of riding. </p>



<p>The night before she was telling me of the story when she used to be a guide for bike tours in the local area I was bike touring through. She told me of all the good stories she had about all the variety of different people who went on tours with her. </p>



<p>She mentioned a boy who was mentally challenged and he went on a tour with her. He was at first, the slowest in the group. The setting for these tours was in the wilderness, like through stunning national parks. One day when the group was gathering for lunch they ended up loosing him. As the rest of the group kept riding while one guide waited back for him. </p>



<p>Anyway long story short, everyone was struggling up the hills and getting to the end of the days riding. Too their surprise he had finished well before the rest of the group and he was quite pleased from his efforts. This seem to have given him confidence in life moving forward as he seem to have struggled with most other things. But bike touring is where he excelled. </p>

<h2>Who&#8217;s In Charge?</h2>



<p>Like the story I mentioned, that lady was running a small guided bike tour business. Which really carried and looked after the individuals on a very personal level. And that type of bike tour needed large amounts of skill and navigation through the remote forrest. Plus she had loads of local knowledge. With a small company like this you are more likely to be dealing with the people who are running the business.  </p>



<p>In comparison you want to think about it before choosing a large global company. Typically, you don&#8217;t know who is leading the tour. The boss may not be the one dealing with your accommodations and all the planning, and the one on the road helping you fix your bike. </p>



<h2>Reviews and Reputation</h2>



<p>Another great way to determine which guided bike tour you should choose. Is too see the companies reviews on a website like TripAdvisor. This is a good way to see what experience others have previously had with the business.  </p>



<p>Some times it can be a bit skewed, as some people who leave comments are very but hurt. And want to get back at the company and it can be for silly things. Like, not being open etc. And with large touring companies the data is also unbalanced compared to small businesses. As negative reviews can really mess up the reputation of the smaller guy.  </p>



<p>If you really want to you can try getting into contact with the operator who may let you contact the previous customer. Who can let you know all about their guided bike tour experience. </p>



<h2>What’s Included?</h2>



<p>can really be hit and miss for some bike tour companies. It is recommended to have a look on their websites to see what each offers specifically. </p>



<p>Generally the best guided bike tour packages include:</p>



<ul><li>Accomodation</li><li>Daily Itineraries and Maps</li><li>Detailed route planning</li><li>All meals and snacks</li><li>Informed travel guide &#8211; often riding in a group </li><li>Tour support vehicle (depending on the type of tour)</li><li>Bicycle maintenance&nbsp;</li><li>Rentals Bikes</li><li>Luggage transport from hotel to hotel</li><li>Admission fees and other costs covered towards site seeing in the package (depending on what you choose to see during the tour)</li></ul>



<h2>Special Requirements</h2>



<p>If you have dietary or special needs requirements. It is important to ask before confirming your tour. And see if they can help for your personal needs. Some guided tours may not be able to accommodate for you if you are vegan. But it is also a good idea to ask, you never know. </p>

<h2>Ask Yourself These Questions</h2>



<p><strong>Why do you want to go on a guided bike tour?</strong></p>



<p>You intention for a guide bicycle tour is very important consideration when choosing the best tour for you. Do you want to focus more on seeing a new country or state. Get to know the people and learn about the history? Or are you more focused on just the cycling side of the trip and want to just ride? And not focus too much on learning about the culture. Do you want to take it slow and enjoy the local food and wine? Or do you want to choose a tour so you can get in some extra training miles while you are visiting another country? </p>



<p><strong>If there are any special scenery you would like to see or different types of elements you want to fit into your bike tour?</strong></p>



<p>There is a large variety of different bike tours out there. With a range of locations and environments to choose from. So what are you most interested in seeing? What specific outdoor scenery are you looking for? Seaside, rural farm, nature parks, a beautiful forests? Or what about big and busy cities? Are you interested in architecture? What about wine and cuisines? </p>



<p><strong>Do you want to experience cultural diversity? </strong></p>



<p>Are you comfortable with travelling oversees and being immersed in a culture where they don&#8217;t speak one word of english? Do you like just getting lost and trying to figure out what to do and where to go with that challenge of another language and cultural difference? Maybe you prefer a more familiar setting? </p>



<p><strong>Where do you want to spend the night and what type of accomodation best suits you?</strong></p>



<p>Do prefer to camp out under the stars in the wilderness? Or spend the night in 4 star hotels in busy cities. Maybe you want to get out of the hustle and bustle and stay at the most amazing rural farm house. </p>



<p><strong>Would you prefer to ride in a group and with a guide or do it solo?</strong></p>



<p>Depending on how you would like to conduct your guide bike tour. you may want to go at it alone. You get to go at your own pace and get to stop at the particular sites that interest you the most. You may get a number for advise and help if you need it. Or you may want to stick together in a group with a guide, where the guide will point all the sights along the way. </p>



<p><strong>Guided group tour</strong></p>



<p>Do you want to share your experience with others? And get to know new people? This type of tour is all organised and done for you. All you have to worry about is riding. You get a experienced guide, who will teach you along the way and there is a structured schedule to follow everyday. </p>



<p><strong>Self-guided individual tour</strong></p>



<p>Maybe you want to go on a tour all by yourself. A self-guided tour is great if you want to get away and just spend some time with just you. The tour company still organises all the details of your tour for you, including hotels, luggage transfers and routes. </p>



<p><strong>What is your fitness and ability level?</strong> <strong>Or are you worried that you will not be able to keep up with the other riders?</strong></p>



<p>Are you fit enough to keep up with the rest of the group? If not then this is still okay as you can get E-bikes for assistance. But there is no need to worry because you actually might be fine. It is not a racing pace and generally guided tour rides are much slower then you think. </p>



<p><strong>How fair to you want to ride everyday?</strong></p>



<p>Consider how far each planned day is in the tour itinerary and compare that with what you personally feel comfortable with riding on a daily basis. </p>



<p><strong>What type of route best suits you? </strong></p>



<p>Do you prefer to ride on trail and hilling terrain? or do you want to ride on pathed bicycle paths in the city? </p>



<p><strong>Are you worried about traffic?</strong></p>



<p>In some places in the world it can be worry riding with vehicles. But if you are in a group you are typically safer. </p>
