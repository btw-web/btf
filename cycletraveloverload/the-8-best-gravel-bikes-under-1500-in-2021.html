<p>So they seem to be some of the most popular articles on the site. In this articles we will take a look at the 8 best gravel bikes ready for you to explore and crush gravel moving into 2021. </p>



<p>I just updated the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-gravel-bikes-under-1000-for-2021-budget-gravel-bikes/">best gravel bikes under $1,000</a> including more 2021 updated gravel bikes. All the bike bikes in this article that you are reading will be between $1,000 to $1,500. So if you want to find even more bang for your buck it might be worth heading over to the sub $1000 gravel bike article <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-gravel-bikes-under-1000-for-2021-budget-gravel-bikes/">here</a>. </p>



<h3>Why Pay Up To $1,500 For A Gravel Bike?</h3>



<p>But if you are willing to spend that little bit more, you can expect to generally get slightly better quality components, with some bikes featuring GRX 400 or Apex setups. Compared to the more modest groupsets, like Claris or Sora that is more common on bikes around $1,000. </p>



<p>While also being slightly lighter-weight overall. Especially the bikes with aluminium frames and carbon fork builds. As carbon fork is generally out of the budget range for sub $1000 gravel bikes. You can expect those bikes to be around that 10 kg mark. Most of the bikes feature mechanical disc brakes with some hydraulic bikes in the list. </p>



<p>Most of them are good for adventure cycling, with rather upright stack/reach ratios over that 1.5 mark (with some exceptions.) </p>

<p>The first bike in this article doesn&#8217;t have the best components but because it is a &#8220;high-end&#8221; brand it had to make the list. This Specialized Diverge Base E5 gravel bike features a Shimano Claris groupset. With a aluminium frame and carbon fork build, mechanical disc brakes and 700 x 35mm tires. The bike has a predictable mid range trail length and an all-rounder mid length chainstay. With a stack/reach ratio at that 1.51 sweet spot </p>



<p>This results in Specialized&#8217;s most progressive geometry they have created for a drop bar bike, giving riders a capable and stable bike in the dirt, that still feels responsive and nimble on the road. The bike also has a reasonable tire clearance for a gravel bike with 47mm of tire clearance for a 700c wheel and 2.1” with a 650b wheel. Priced from $1,200</p>



<h2>2021 Vitus Substance V 2</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="437" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Vitus-Substance-V-2-Adventure-Road-Bike-Sora-2021_01-1.jpg?resize=720%2C437&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6875" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Vitus-Substance-V-2-Adventure-Road-Bike-Sora-2021_01-1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Vitus-Substance-V-2-Adventure-Road-Bike-Sora-2021_01-1.jpg?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Vitus-Substance-V-2-Adventure-Road-Bike-Sora-2021_01-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C622&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Vitus-Substance-V-2-Adventure-Road-Bike-Sora-2021_01-1.jpg?resize=768%2C467&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Vitus-Substance-V-2-Adventure-Road-Bike-Sora-2021_01-1.jpg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Marketed as an adventure road bike this Vitus Substance is capable to take you on some off the beaten path adventures. With a 2 x 9 Sora, FSA groupset (again not the highest end components here.) Alloy frame and carbon fork build, weighing 23.7 lbs / 10.7 kg, mechanical disc brakes and rolling on 650b x 47 wheels and tires. However these rims are compatible with 700c. </p>



<p>Slightly more aero stack/reach ratio at 1.49, the bike has a higher end and stable trail length and a chill, mid range chainstay length. Priced at £899.99</p>



<h2>2021 Masi Giramondo 700c</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="431" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/45b9e-1-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C431&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6877" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/45b9e-1-1.jpeg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/45b9e-1-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/45b9e-1-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C460&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/45b9e-1-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Giramondo from Masi has to be one of my personal favourite gravel bikes that you can pick up for a truly bargain price for what you get. It speaks value for money! The fact that you get upper mid-range components with the 3 x 10 Deore, GRX 800 that also has a huge gear range! That&#8217;s 18.78″ to 112.13″ gear inches!! A full steel build, quality Tubus front and rear racks, with 700 x 45c tires. </p>



<p>This bike is adventure ready, and is best if you plan to go on epic bikepacking adventures or tours around the world! With bar-end shifters it is a mash between a traditional touring bike and gravel bike! </p>



<p>The Giramondo has a super upright 1.55 stack/reach ratio, predictable mi range trail, a chill to stable rear with a longer length chainstay than most other gravel bikes. Making enough clearance and balance to run rear panniers if you wish! All that for a tasty <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FMasi-Giramondo-700c-Bike">$1,299</a></p>

<p>If you want a gravel bike that is a bit more quick and snappy, something like the Norco Search might be worth looking at. A do-it-all bike that craves adventure and redefines gravel. </p>



<p>It does feature a much lower 1.45 stack/reach ratio, putting you in a more racer position. Comes with a 2 x 10 GRX 400, Tiagra, mid-range components and mechanical disc brakes. With 700 c x 38 mm tires. </p>



<p>It has a quick feeling, shorter chainstay than most gravel bikes and a mid/high length trail making it predictable and stable in the front. Priced at $1,499, this bike is also available in the Norco Search XR Flat Bar option with a 1 x 11 Deore groupset and hydraulic disc brake setup, for $1,149</p>



<h2>2021 Marin DSX 2</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="399" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MY21-Marin-DSX-2-P-Final.jpg?resize=720%2C399&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6880" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MY21-Marin-DSX-2-P-Final.jpg?w=1863&amp;ssl=1 1863w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MY21-Marin-DSX-2-P-Final.jpg?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MY21-Marin-DSX-2-P-Final.jpg?resize=1024%2C568&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MY21-Marin-DSX-2-P-Final.jpg?resize=768%2C426&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MY21-Marin-DSX-2-P-Final.jpg?resize=1536%2C852&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MY21-Marin-DSX-2-P-Final.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MY21-Marin-DSX-2-P-Final.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Another flat bar gravel bike option is Marin new DSX 2 alloy frame and carbon fork, upper mid-range components gravel bike. With the 1 x 12 Deore groupset and hydraulic disc brakes, it is the ultimate gravel commuter! With 700C x 45mm tires. Shimano Deore 12-Speed, 10-51T rear cassette and a Forged Aluminum, 42T Steel Narrow Wide Chainring, priced at $1,099</p>

<p>I did mention the Breezer Radar Expert in the under $1,000 gravel bike article (however the new 2021 model is over that price and is a wonderful gravel bike.) But we are going to take a look at the new all steel Radar X mid-range component gravel bike. Featuring a 1 x 11 Apex, FSA groupset, hydraulic disc brakes, 700 x 52c (29 x 2.25) wheels/tires. With a rather limited FSA Comet Modular, 38T crank and SRAM PG-1130, 11-42T cassette and lower then ideal 1.43 stack/reach ratio. Not the best option for long gravel adventures in the saddle. Still would make a great day ride gravel grinder! </p>
