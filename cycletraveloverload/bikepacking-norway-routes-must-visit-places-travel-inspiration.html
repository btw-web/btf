<h2><strong>Bikepacking Norway </strong></h2>



<p>Norway is the Geographical backbone of Scandinavia bordering Sweden, Finland and Russia with one of the longest coastlines in the world. It is home to some of the most remote communities on Earth. Norway’s history dates back to around 9000BC. Most famous within the Viking Age (8th -10th Century AD) it has preserved Viking longships and a lot of stories nowhere else in the world can tell. The native Sami people continue to inhabit the northernmost parts and still wear their traditional colourful dress and tend to their herds of reindeer. Contrastly, Norway is home to some of the most modern renewable energy technologies and is the eco-friendly world leader in this industry. Modern day Norway takes great care in preserving its natural beauty. It’s magnificent fjords, colourful wooden buildings, breathtaking mountains and vastly beautiful open spaces are just a handful of reasons to consider Norway as your next Bikepacking adventure destination. To enjoy all this outstanding beauty you need to be prepared to take on some serious distances and climbs. Norway welcomes experienced cyclists seeking out challenging adventures. After all, how much more eco-friendly can bikepacking get!?</p>



<p>Norway is a country which has National cycle routes planned out, some are even part of the EuroVelo routes. These allow you to take in maximum nature whilst avoiding heavy traffic and main roads and you have the luxury of signposts along the way. You can ride through dense forests, along magnificent fjords, across towering mountains and stop off in quaint fishing villages without the fear of being whisked off your seat by huge trucks and speeding motorists.</p>



<p>Norway is an elongated country with an Atlantic coastline, lending itself to varied climates. It benefits from the Gulf Stream but this does not mean you will be cycling in shorts and T-shirt. You will no doubt find yourself soggy and windswept one day and ogling at multiple rainbows and blue skies the next. Be prepared for strong winds and maybe some snow! It all depends where your route takes you, inland will be less extreme and Bergen will be very wet. Due to it’s Northern positioning the hours of daylight vary greatly from winter to summer. In the summer months the Northernmost parts benefit from the midnight sun giving you endless hours of cycling time! However, in the Winter months you may only get a few hours of sunlight but might be lucky enough to see the Northern lights! Considering this we recommend going in their Summer.</p>



<p>Below we have<strong> </strong>outlined four of our favourite Bikepacking routes in Norway. We have tried to include a variety of options. There are SO many gorgeous options you could go back every year and have a different adventure each time. We have chosen three of the National Cycle Routes and an exciting circular route around Norway to tickle your tastebuds.</p>



<h2><strong>Routes</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Cycle route 1 &#8211; The coastal route</strong></h3>



<p>Although this is our first choice we are by no means easing you in. This route is 4500km long and runs the entire coast of Norway from Svinesund to Kirkenes. If you aren’t experienced or don’t have the time you can complete shorter, easier sections of this route. It coincides with several EuroVelo routes along the way, including over 2000km of the Atlantic Coast Route EuroVelo 1. There is some eye-watering scenery on this coastal route. You’ll be crossing deep fjords by ferry, cycling down small pedestrian paths and hopping on and off islands. You will find yourself immersed in unfathomably fresh air, the stillness of the lakes and rustling of trees.</p>



<h3><strong>Cycle route 3 &#8211; Fjord and Mountain route</strong></h3>



<p>This is the route to consider if you want to get right up close to some of the most famous Fjords and craggy mountains Norway has. It runs from Kristiansand in Southern Norway through the Hardangerfjord region and up to Kristiansund in the Northwest. Covering 1000km of waterfall spray, peaceful lakes and gargantuan fjords you will be stopping every 5 minutes for photos. Why not take a day or so off riding to go hiking, rock climbing or kayaking?</p>



<h3><strong>Cycle Route Rallarvegen &#8211; The Navvy Road</strong></h3>



<p>This route follows an old trade line from Bergen to Oslo built in 1902 and is very popular in the cycling community. The famous switchbacks are generally less wild than our other options and many cycling tours operate on this line. Some stats say over 20,000 cyclists make this 80km journey every summer! If you go early in the season it is much quieter. It may be less wild but still offers a wide variety of terrains all the way up to the country’s highest train station to keep you on your toes. A lot of the tourist board photography is taken along this route so keep your camera handy.</p>



<h3><strong>‘AroundNorway’ &#8211; circular route</strong></h3>



<p>‘AroundNorway’ is an unsupported bike packing event. It covers 3250km and 38,000m of ascent. It is not for the faint hearted. Starting and Finishing in Oslo, taking you up to Trondheim and back down through Bergen it really does cover all that Norway has to offer. Allow yourself two weeks to cover all the ground, and fjords. Under your wheels expect to find everything from tarmac, gravel, boulders and snow, to cattle grids, bridges and cold-sweat-inducing switchbacks. If you have a fat bike, bring it!</p>



<h3><strong>Must visit places and Travel Inspiration</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Bergen &#8211; </strong>the colourful city on the west coast. Take a ride up Mount Floyen on the Funicular for fantastic views over the city. Or maybe work up a sweat on the 722 steps of the Stoltzekleiven trail to earn the views. Bergen is home to one of the main trading centres in the Viking Age the historic houses and buildings are teaming with local art and produce. It doesn’t get much more Scandinavian looking than this!</p>



<p><strong>Fjords &#8211; </strong>Hardanger Fjord is the third longest fjord in the world and 900m deep. It is one of the most incredible places to take a rest day and indulge in the impressive nature the area offers. Near to this fjord is the famous Trolltunga rocky precipice. There is a significant 22km hike up to this scenic spot overhanging a lake, but totally worth it. The most famous Norwegian Fjord is the Geirangerfjord which is UNESCO listed. Pictures will never do this dramatic landscape justice, a must see when you visit Norway.</p>



<p><strong>Tromso &#8211; </strong>If you&#8217;re chasing the Northern Lights then get yourself right up North in Tromso in the winter months for the best chance of catching the mesmerising light display. If you visit in the summer months you will experience the extraordinary midnight sun. Up here there are Sami natives living and working, take time to learn about them and visit where possible.</p>



<p>Norway is undoubtedly a land of beauty like no other. It’s unique landscapes cannot be mirrored elsewhere. The Bikepacking here is challenging but rewarding. If it is your first trip then choose your route carefully as you may find yourself crossing some tricky terrain in some unexpected weather. If this isn’t your first rodeo then the Kingdom of Norway is a playground like no other. A short trip ‘away from it all’ could become one of a lifetime. </p>
