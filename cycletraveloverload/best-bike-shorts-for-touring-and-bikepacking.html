<p>When looking at shorts for bikepacking and touring there are multiple factors that will indicate what type of shorts you get. First there is a variety of different types of shorts. In a nutshell there are chamois shorts which are padded areo style bike shorts and the more baggy casual style of shorts, like mountain bike shorts. </p>



<p>Let me tell you when I first got started in cycling I was road cycling and that meant padded bike shorts that are tight fitting is a must. But to be honest only where those shorts for long mutli-day bike trips it is just not that comfortable. </p>



<p>When heading out on long adventures for days on end I prefer to wear casual style shorts that allow me to feel more comfortable when walking around and not have to pull wedgies every 5 minutes. </p>



<p>Although depending on your saddle setup you still may require some padded bike chamois shorts that are always great to wear underneath some standard shorts. Or you could get casual shorts with a padded cutout. or do it yourself! Ever since I got a Brooks B17 saddle I have no longer needed to wear chamois shorts under my main shorts. </p>



<p>When looking at shorts the material is another big factor. You don&#8217;t want materials like polyester or cotton which can get stinky and feel terrible after the fest of bike touring starts to break them down. The best materials for bike travel are nylon or merino wool. As they also take less time to dry, provide some breathability and they also stinky much less. </p>



<p>It might be a better option for you to get a few pairs of traditional spandex bike shorts to change to keep clean for multiple days of bike adventures. It is a great idea, as I remember when touring Australia I only had 1 pair of Lycra shorts and they got wet and became super uncomfortable and caused chafing. It would have been a great solution to have multiple pairs to change into. </p>



<p>So having multiple pairs of the traditional spandex bike shorts with only one pair of baggy or casual style bike shorts is the best solution. As the baggy shorts are heavier, you then only having the extra weight for one baggy pair of shorts. </p>



<p>So when going in and out of businesses or just want to be more discreet. Wearing loose shorts over a pair of Lyrcra shorts works, then if you are out on the open roads you can just wear the spandex shorts if you like. </p>



<p>Padded merino undies are another option for underwear to wear under a casual pair of bikepacking shorts. They are great for wicking sweat and reduce the effect of chafing. </p>



<p>So what are the best bike shorts for long distance rides? First we will start with the casual option that would be best if you have a very comfortable saddle that generally does not require wearing Lycra shorts. </p>

<p>7Mesh designed these shorts are specifically designed for bikepacking, gravel, or all-road adventures. I personally don&#8217;t like the really baggy style of mtb shorts. These shorts however eliminate the baggy or bulky feel of typical off-road shorts. While insuring that on bike movements are not restricted. </p>



<p>These shorts are made with a soft double-weave face for durability and a looped yarn at the back. the material is a Ever Nylon Stretch 2-4 way (85% Nylon, 15% Elastane), DWR-treated. The shorts also come with dual pockets. Also features a phone sleeve which keeps your phone secure while riding. Also reinforced crotch seams and a low-profile locking waist adjusters finish off these wonderful shorts. </p>

<p>These Alpkit shorts are a stylish option that are more affordable then most in this list but still, offer quick-drying for extended cycling adventures, and the ability to wear them alone or layer over undershorts. </p>



<p>Quoted by Alpkit themselves, &#8220;Alpine summer touring, peak district cafe-hopping (on-road or off), bike packing trips… Strada are made for comfort when riding, as well as when refuelling for the next leg of the journey…&#8221;</p>



<p>Are are somewhere between baggy and a tight fit. They are not just great for riding but work well when hiking your bike up a mountain too. </p>

<p>The single weave 95% nylon, 5% spandex fabric is light and breathable, with four-way stretch and a tailored cut that feels good to ride in. The Zip side pockets are deep enough to hold a 500ml water bottle and not interfere when pedalling or walking. </p>



<p>One thing to note is these shorts are a add sizing then normal, so make sure to get the right size for you. </p>



<p>These shorts could be a wonderful choice for bikepacking as they have a great fit. You will find them more baggy at the rear but a little slimmer fit along the legs.</p>

<p>These were tested out in summer conditions and when the daytime temps were between 23 and 28 Celsius, they were still comfortable. These are great to use as regular shorts to, even when hiking. </p>

<p>These are the padded Lycra style bike shorts, that I have been using before I got my Brooks saddle and no longer required them for comfort. But I can highly recommended these shorts if you are looking for some padded shorts for touring or bikepacking. </p>



<p>These bike shorts are a updated version of the <strong>PEARL iZUMi classic</strong>. They also offer a womens style. Both options costing $80 each. These have been my go too padded shorts option, and I can recommend them but if you don&#8217;t want to take my word, <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F892695%2Fpearl-izumi-pursuit-attack-bike-shorts-mens">I suggest you head over to REI and read the reviews for yourself.</a></p>
