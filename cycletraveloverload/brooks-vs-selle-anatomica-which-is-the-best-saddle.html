<p>Both of these very popular bike saddles earned a spot on the list in this article I wrote about some of the&nbsp;<a href="http://cycletraveloverload.com/best-touring-saddles-best-road-bike-saddle-for-long-rides/">best bike touring saddles</a>. Both Brooks and Selle Anatomica are great saddles that would both make the perfect choice. But which of the two comes out on top when compared to one and other? </p>



<p>Today we are going to look into both options and see where your money is best spent. To save you some time if you want to know straight away. For us the Brooks B17 is the better saddle of the two. But find out why below! You can also read my review of the Brooks <a href="http://cycletraveloverload.com/brooks-b17-leather-saddle-review/">here</a>. </p>



<h2>Brief History </h2>



<p>First let quickly look at where both these brands have come from and get a understanding of their backgrounds. Just to paint the picture! </p>



<h2>Brooks</h2>



<p>Brooks is a well established brand that has been around since 1866. The company was founded in&nbsp;Hockley, Birmingham. According to Brooks fmily legend, the company started when founder John Boultbee Brooks, who was a horse saddle manufacturer at the time. Tried riding a bicycle after his horse had died. But he found the wooden seat to be very uncomfortable, so from the moment he set about solving this problem and Brooks was born. And to this day they have been dominating the leather saddle market. </p>



<h2>Selle Anatomica</h2>



<p>On the other hand Selle Anatomica is a very recent brand that has just got into the market, it was founded in 2006 by Tommy Milton. Through his love of riding and years of research and development he made what Selle Anatomica saddles is today. Unfortunately Tommy died unexpectedly in 2010. </p>



<h2>Break In Time</h2>



<p>This is where the Selle wins is the break in period. It requires no time at all. &#8220;This saddle has no break in period. It feels good from day one&#8221;. while the B17 does require some time to break in. Some believe it takes over 1000 miles. But from my own experience it only took a couple days riding 100 km each day. </p>



<p>My only concern with a no break in period with a leather saddle like the Selle, that makes me believe that it does not shape to your body and does not provide the most comfort that a Brooks does when broken in. But the x-series saddles by Selle are made from a softer material meaning that they break in period is reduced. Making then ready and feeling comfortable for most who use them right out of the box. </p>



<h2>Cutout</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selle-Anatomica-X-Series.png?resize=560%2C315" alt="" class="wp-image-3674" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selle-Anatomica-X-Series.png?w=560&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selle-Anatomica-X-Series.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selle-Anatomica-X-Series.png?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Both the Brooks and Selle offer cutout saddle options. The main reason for a cut out on a saddle is to reduce pressure on those important personal areas when riding. But with these saddles they provide a plethora of other benefits to. The cutout gives the saddle a bit more flex and moves with your peddling motion pretty naturally. Also it acts as a bit of suspension when going over bumps.</p>



<p>But out of the two options the Selle has a better cutout design then the Brooks. Also the most popular Brooks B17 saddle is not designed around a cut out. Brooks do offer cutout options with the C17 carved and the B17 Imperial. The cutout on the Selle also known as the &#8216;Flex-Fly Slot&#8217; is quite long much longer then the Brooks. Which works great at reducing perineal pressure, sit bone pain, and saddle sores. It is longer in theory it provides more relief on pressured areas providing a more comfortable ride. </p>



<h2>Dimensions</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="350" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selle-Anatomica-Dimensions_800x-1.jpg?resize=683%2C350" alt="" class="wp-image-3677" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selle-Anatomica-Dimensions_800x-1.jpg?w=683&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selle-Anatomica-Dimensions_800x-1.jpg?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selle-Anatomica-Dimensions_800x-1.jpg?resize=50%2C26&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Selle Anatomica Dimensions </figcaption></figure></div>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Brooks Model</strong></td><td><strong>Width</strong></td><td><strong>Length</strong></td><td><strong>Height</strong></td></tr><tr><td>B15 Swallow</td><td>153 mm</td><td>285 mm</td><td>62 mm</td></tr><tr><td>Team Pro</td><td>160 mm</td><td>273 mm</td><td>67 mm</td></tr><tr><td>Team Pro S</td><td>176 mm</td><td>242 mm</td><td>63 mm</td></tr><tr><td>B17 Narrow</td><td>151 mm</td><td>279 mm</td><td>70 mm</td></tr><tr><td>B17 Standard</td><td>175 mm</td><td>275 mm</td><td>65 mm</td></tr><tr><td>B17 S</td><td>176 mm</td><td>242 mm</td><td>58 mm</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>The Brooks saddles are designed for wider sit bones making them fit most people. The sit bone width for all Selle Saddles are all the same at 130 mm. While Brooks saddles you get more variety of sizes and different fits for all types of sit bone widths. Brooks offer up to 170 mm widths which means you get better comfort as your sit bones are on more suspended material and keeping them off the cantle plate/rivet section. The reason some people don&#8217;t like the Brooks saddles is that they may get a saddle that is to narrow for their sit bones. If you are not sure what size your sit bones are <a href="http://cycletraveloverload.com/best-touring-saddles-best-road-bike-saddle-for-long-rides/">this is a good way to find out.</a></p>



<p>The Selle Anatomica saddles are generally longer then most of the Brooks saddle options as they are all made at 290 mm in length while the Brooks can vary from 240 mm to 285 mm. </p>



<h2>Rails</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selle-Anatomica-X-Series-1.png?resize=560%2C315" alt="" class="wp-image-3679" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selle-Anatomica-X-Series-1.png?w=560&amp;ssl=1 560w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selle-Anatomica-X-Series-1.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selle-Anatomica-X-Series-1.png?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Brooks saddles tend to have longer rails&nbsp;than many other saddles on the market. And are made from many materials from steel to titanium. The Selle Anatomica saddles seem to slightly shorter ones then all the Brooks options. Which is not always the best, as they tend to bend as some users have reported. The Selle rails are made from a Heat Treated 4130 Chromoly Steel. They also offer the most setback on their rails. This is a good and bad thing, las their saddles come with lots of setback. It allows for maximum adjustability and fit. But also makes the rail more likely to bend when a rider places the saddle in an extreme setback position. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, earlier models of Selle saddles had issues. Mostly to do with the rails. The long chromoly steel rails found on the Titanico and X1 were prone to bending under a heavy load or when put under sudden stress, such as unintended jarring from a big bump. With proper care you can reduce such problems happening. Even so, it’s far from ideal to have this risk with a long-distance touring saddle. But ever since they have been heat treating their rails, the bending rails issue was remedied. The rails on the Selle X2 are made from Stainless steel tubular rails. Witch sounds nice considering the rails on my B17 is a steel but is beginning to develop some surface rust underneath the saddle. </p>



<h2>Adjustability</h2>



<p>Both require the same style of adjustment at the front of the saddle. Having a tensioner nut at the nose of the saddle, the entire threaded post is supposed to move, when the nut is tightened. Lifting the sag if any of the leather up and making the saddle more comfortable to sit on. But the Brooks saddles don&#8217;t really require the use of the tool that often, and people often ruin their saddles with these adjustment wrenches. </p>



<h2>Weight</h2>



<p>Comparing the two best recommended saddles from either brand we should take a head to head look at the differences. Especially weight as this can be a factor for those looking to cut weight for bikepacking trips. </p>



<p>The Brooks B17 vs Selle Anatomica X2 is a great comparison for example. The B17 for example comes in at 520 grams while the X2 weighs 420 grams that is 100 grams lighter. So as you can see why these saddles are popular with some bikepacking enthusiasts. They both are not the lightest saddles on the market, there are other options that are lighter, like in this post of <a href="http://cycletraveloverload.com/best-touring-saddles-best-road-bike-saddle-for-long-rides/">the best bikepacking and touring saddles.</a> But weight is not everything, especially when looking for a saddle that need to provide adequate comfort for long days in the saddle. </p>



<h2>Leather</h2>



<p>Brooks leather is vulnerable to wet weather conditions and it is recommended to cover your saddle when raining to avoid long term damage. That is a bit hard when you are touring or bikepacking for days on end. But it is recommended to take a plastic bag or a special saddle cover to protect your saddle from rain when ever possible. Selle Anatomica leather is topped with dual reinforcing laminate layers. </p>



<h2>Things to keep in mind about Selle Anatomica Saddles</h2>



<ul><li>Some users have reported that this saddle can get squeaky at times. Especially when used in dusty environments. </li><li>The rails can bend easily if you are not careful. There are different weight requirements for the leather and the rails. According to the company, there are also requirements for where on the rail you install it and what type of body frame you have. Make sure to look into these details to see if you will be a appropriate weight for the saddle you are looking at. </li><li>The saddle requires no break-in and is super flexible. A comfortable saddle for most users right out of the box. If you want immediate results in comfort without waiting for a break in period this is a better choice. </li></ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Overall you cannot go past the reliability of a well established company in Brooks and the long track record they have for providing exception saddles for many, many years. Although it sounds good supporting a USA brand in Selle Anatomica as they do provide very nice looking saddles which are in my opinion better looking then the Brooks. But at the end of the day it comes down to comfort and how you feel on the bike. All cyclists are different, but overall Brooks comes out on top as they provide a more superior and comfortable saddle.</p>



<p>When looking at prices comparing the two best saddles from either brand. The B17 and the X2. The B17 is a more affordable saddle that is also superior. So it only makes sense to go for a Brooks Saddle over the Selle Anatomica Saddle. </p>
