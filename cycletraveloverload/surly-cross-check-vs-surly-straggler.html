<p>If you are after that ultimate steel commuter bike both these options are worth looking at. So what is the difference between the Surly Cross-Check and the Surly Straggler?</p>



<p><strong>At first glance the Cross-Check is a pavement commuter bike at heart that is capable of gravel riding. And the Straggler a gravel bike that is capable of commuting. Both made of steel, the Cross-Check uses rim v-brakes while the Straggler has mechanical disc brakes. The Straggler has 6mm shorter trail and a lower&nbsp;BB, making it a fast&nbsp;handling bike compared to the Cross-Check. The Cross-Check comes with a Deore, Tiagra﻿ 2 x 10 drivetrain and the Straggler a SRAM Apex 1 x 11. The Cross-Check is much cheaper from $925 while the Straggler is around $1,650.</strong></p>

<p>But there is still so much to cover when comparing these two bikes. What are they? Well you will have to read on! </p>



<p>If you are after the best Surly gravel bike. I would recommend you read our <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/surly-straggler-vs-midnight-special/">Surly Straggler Vs Midnight Special</a> showdown! </p>



<p>If single speed conversion is on your mind. Both bikes have you covered. The Cross-check has Semi-horizontal dropouts for single speed compatibility and wheelbase adjustability. While the Straggler has Forward-exiting horizontal dropouts for single speed compatibility and wheelbase adjustability. </p>



<p>The Straggler has clearance for 650b x 41mm or 700c x 41mm tires with fenders! While the Cross-Check has clearance for 700c x 42mm tires with or without fenders. </p>



<p>Both bikes come with the option to fit racks and fenders. While the Straggler is available in 650b and 700c wheel diameters. The Cross-Check is available in a flat bar and drop bar while Straggler only drop bars. </p>



<p>The 650b Straggler comes in frame sizes that are more suitable for shorter riders. But let&#8217;s take a more indepth look at the bikes geometry and see what this means for handling and preferred types of riding conditions. </p>



<h2>Geometry </h2>



<p>(*Measurements listed in millimeters, for a 56cm sized frame.)</p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td>Bike</td><td>Cross-Check</td><td>Straggler</td></tr><tr><td>Wheels</td><td>700c</td><td>650b</td></tr><tr><td>Stack</td><td>556.5</td><td>567.3</td></tr><tr><td>Reach</td><td>394.3</td><td>400.7</td></tr><tr><td>Top Tube Length</td><td>570</td><td>580</td></tr><tr><td>Seat Tube Length</td><td>560</td><td>560</td></tr><tr><td>Seat Tube Angle</td><td>72.5</td><td>72.5</td></tr><tr><td>Head Tube Length</td><td>121</td><td>121</td></tr><tr><td>Head Tube Angle</td><td>72</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>BB Drop</td><td>66</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>Front Center</td><td>603</td><td>612</td></tr><tr><td>Chainstay Length</td><td>425</td><td>430</td></tr><tr><td>Wheelbase</td><td>1019.7</td><td>1031.9</td></tr><tr><td>Rake</td><td>44</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Trail</td><td>67</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Standover Height</td><td>826.7</td><td>809.4</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>The geometry of a bike can make all the difference when choosing. First you need to figure out what you are going to be using the bike for mostly? And your budget?</p>



<p>Taking a look at the bikes trail lengths (all measurements are for 56 cm sized frames). The Straggler trail is 6 mm shorter which in theory means that it is quicker and more responsive to control when cornering in the front, then the Cross-check. Which is ideal for singletrack and tight cornering gravel sections. Also this shorter trail makes for a racier feel, with less lag in cornering response. </p>



<p>Standover height for the Cross-check is 17.3 mm higher then the Straggler. Both Rake lengths are the same at 44mm. Wheelbase on the Straggler is longer by 12.2 mm which makes this bike more stable when under a load of gear. And the chainstay length is also 5 mm longer on the Straggler, making for some extra clearance for pedalling with panniers. This added length makes the Straggler a better bike when it comes to pavement touring.</p>



<p>Also the BB Drop is 6 mm longer on the Straggler which puts the bikes centre of gravity lower to the ground, for added stability. Also the front center is 9 mm longer on the Straggler with that extra room to prevent your toes contacting the front wheel when cornering. </p>



<p>The headtube angle, headtube length, seat tube angle and seat tube length are all the same lengths. However the toptube length on the straggler is 10 mm longer. The reach is 6.4 mm longer on the Straggler and stack is 10.8 mm longer on the Straggler. Putting the stack/reach ratio for the Straggler at 1.42 and Cross-Check 1.41. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at both bikes gearing capabilities. This is another important aspect when it comes to comparing bikes. If your hope is to use one of these bikes for climbing steep stuff. You need the best bike with a wider range of gear inches to spin more comfortability. Also not as important but if you want to send it really fast down hill or ride very fast the largest gear inches is ideal. </p>



<p>If you are looking for a bike that you want to slap some gear on and go bikepacking on some steep climbs then the Straggler is most ideal out of these two bikes for such riding. With the lower 27.80&#8243; gear inches for the granny gear compared to the 31.41&#8243; on the Cross-Check. </p>



<p>The Cross-Check features a Deore, Tiagra﻿ 2 x 10 drivetrain with Shimano CX50, 36/46t crank and Shimano CS-HG50-10, 11-32, 10 speed cassette. Then the Straggler has a SRAM Apex 1 x 11 drivetrain with SRAM Apex 42T crank and SRAM 11-42t 11 speed cassette. </p>



<p>When it comes to the largest gear inches for riding the fastest down hill. The Cross-Check comes out on top with 116.18&#8243; gear inches compared to the Stragglers 106.18&#8243;. </p>



<h2>Surly Cross-Check</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="551" height="390" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FlatBar_CrossCheck_1.jpg?resize=551%2C390&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6250" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FlatBar_CrossCheck_1.jpg?w=551&amp;ssl=1 551w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FlatBar_CrossCheck_1.jpg?resize=300%2C212&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FlatBar_CrossCheck_1.jpg?resize=50%2C35&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Cross-Check was the first complete bike Surly ever offered. One could say it was a gravel bike before they became a thing. Some people have even raced cyclocross on it. (Not exactly recommended). But it is a completely capable bike for under $1,000. </p>



<p>Surly even say that The Straggler is kinda like a Cross-Check with disc brakes. Which means that they are both very similar bikes. However that main difference with the bikes brakes, is where it is at! </p>



<p>The Cross-Check has v-brakes for a reason. If the Cross-Check had disk brakes it would get in the way of its functionality and simplicity. </p>



<p>But it’s pretty difficult to make a horizontal dropout (for the single speeders out there) with a chainstay-mounted disc caliper. It is just that chainstay-mounted disc brake calipers and forward loading, horizontal, rack-friendly dropouts. Don&#8217;t work that well together which is why the Cross-Check is the way that it is. </p>



<p>Depending on what type of Cross-Check you look at the drop bar option has bar end shifters. This might not be prefered if you plan to ride in the city regularly. The Straggler comes with integrated shifting which keeps your hands next to the brakes when changing gears. Which might be preferred for some when commuting the city. </p>



<p>It must be worth mentioning that v-brakes should not be the only descension point when choosing between the two. V-brakes still perform rather well compared to mechanical disk brakes. In my opinion it is hydraulic brakes that are the best out of all. </p>



<p>But having that said if you plan to build up a bike. The Cross-Check might be your best option, as it will be cheaper to add parts. As it only cost <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FSurly-Cross-Check-Frameset%3Favad%3D256925_a1c68e169">$500 for a frameset.</a> But if you are going to buy complete then I would recommend the Straggler. </p>



<p>The best pick for the Cross-Check options available, would have to be the flat bar Cross-Check. If you plan on riding in traffic. Flat bars are generally better in traffic then drop bars. </p>



<h2>Surly Straggler</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="302" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-4050.jpeg?resize=720%2C302&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6251" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-4050.jpeg?w=930&amp;ssl=1 930w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-4050.jpeg?resize=300%2C126&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-4050.jpeg?resize=768%2C322&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-4050.jpeg?resize=50%2C21&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you plan to ride more gravel and plan to do CX which means you will be riding in the mud then the Straggler is the better option. The Straggler has a more racier geometry as we covered with more of road bike dimensions. Also you might prefer the acceleration of 650b wheels for getting around the city.</p>



<p>Yes the Straggler is more expensive but if you are after a complete bike and buying new the Straggler wins for me. You could look around on the used market and you might get lucky and find a used Straggler for the price of a new Cross-Check if price is a deal breaker. </p>



<p>Put in a nutshell the Straggler is a &#8220;mountain biker’s road bike&#8221;. A utilitarian townie, a light-duty touring bike and an all-weather commuter. Also if you are just getting into touring or plan to do some light touring or bikepacking. This rig is more suited to such adventures. Thanks to the geometry. Probably better for credit card touring rather than full-blown tour. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s be honest the Straggler is the better looking bike! Well I guess this is subjective. but there is something about 1x gravel groupsets that make a bike look so rad! </p>



<p>But I hope this article has helped you to decide which bike out of the Cross-Check and Straggler would suit you personally? Please leave a comment below if you have any questions. Or want to add some other points in comparison about these two bikes. </p>
