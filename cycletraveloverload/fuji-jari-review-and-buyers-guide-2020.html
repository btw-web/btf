<p>Are you after a budget friendly gravel bike that is capable at delivering decent rideability for cycling adventures? The Fuji Jari made an appearance in our <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/23-best-gravel-bikes-under-1000-budget-gravel-bikes/">top 23 gravel bikes under $1000</a> list. The Jari is best suited for either gravel races, light touring or bikepacking. They advertise it as a bike that could pretty much do everything but with a bike that is budget like this it does have some draw backs as expected. But for the price it stills gives incredible value while offering overall performance, utility and versatility. On first impression it looks like a solidly capable bike. If you are after a touring specific bike that is suited only for road touring then you should look at the Fuji Touring Bike. But if you want to hit the trails and explore off-road as well this Jari gravel bike is the better option. </p>

<p>It is one of the bikes I would consider if I only had a budget around $1000 to spend on a bike. The bike is designed with a long, slack geometry which provides a stable and confidence-inspiring ride no matter what the terrain, allowing you to comfortably grind gravel or tackle tarmac. A bike that is to be used for transporting your gear for say a bicycle tour. In my opinion needs eyelets and to be honest the more the better. This Fuji has almost all the possible eyelets you could need. You get mounts on the seat stays, a separate rack and mudguard mount at the rear dropout, lowrider mounts and eyelets both in front of and behind the dropout on the fork, triple cage mounts and bento box mounts. It is a must for me for a bike to have adequate mounts and this bike delivers above and beyond in this department. </p>



<p>If you plan to go on really tough bicycle adventures. Where you will be mostly off-road and smashing your bike down fast and rocky descents. It is probably not the bike for that. But if you are looking for a maybe a first touring bike or just getting into bikepacking. Where you will be riding gravel, light off-road or road riding. This is an ideal choice especially if you are looking to spend as little money as possible to see if this world of bikepacking and touring is for you. While still getting a bike that offers decent performance. You can pick up the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=69067d2e-fbd9-4498-8fe8-2a32f6244b5a&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nashbar.com%2Ffuji-bikes-2020-jari-2.5-road-bike-black-brick-red-l-1791556456%2Fp962853%3Fv%3D955075%26avad%3D256925_d19a24cd5">Fuji Jari 2.5 model for only $699.99 at Nashbar.</a> But lets get into some other pros and cons of this bike. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2019_FUJI_JARI_25_BLACK_FRONT.jpg?resize=720%2C495&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4773" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2019_FUJI_JARI_25_BLACK_FRONT.jpg?w=2400&amp;ssl=1 2400w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2019_FUJI_JARI_25_BLACK_FRONT.jpg?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2019_FUJI_JARI_25_BLACK_FRONT.jpg?resize=768%2C528&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2019_FUJI_JARI_25_BLACK_FRONT.jpg?resize=1024%2C704&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2019_FUJI_JARI_25_BLACK_FRONT.jpg?resize=50%2C34&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2019_FUJI_JARI_25_BLACK_FRONT.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2019_FUJI_JARI_25_BLACK_FRONT.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you are really on a budget it seems like a rather decent bike stock. The frame and forks are intended for quick release wheels though, so not the latest standard. If money is tight it might be wise to just invest in <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/all-about-fenders-mudguards-for-gravel-adventure-bikes/">mudguards</a>, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/12-best-front-bike-racks-for-touring-bikepacking/">front</a> and <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-rear-bike-rack-for-touring-commuting/">rear rack</a>, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-bike-panniers-best-panniers-for-touring-commuting-bikepacking/">panniers</a>, or <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/73-best-bikepacking-bags-in-2019-the-ultimate-list/">bikepacking bags</a> and you should be good to go!</p>

<p>However another idea would be to purchase it as a frameset and then build your own setup with higher quality components like (hydraulic brakes and a better wheelset.) The current components are rather cheap and not the best by far. Which is a potential down side to the Jari. This seems like a good time to introduce the three different models the Jari is available in. And we can compare the components to see which is a better choice. And even if it is worth just buying the frameset and building your dream gravel adventure bike.</p>

<p>The Jari 2.3 is built with a Reynolds 520 chromoly steel frame. It is the mid range option out of the three. All bikes come with aluminium wheels and mechanical disc brakes. This bike option however you get a 2X9 Alivio, Sora groupset it is classified as a mid-range component level steel frame touring bike. See the comparison table below to compare the different bikes components and parts. </p>

<p style="text-align:center">FUJI<br>JARI 1.5<br><strong>$1,399</strong></p>



<p>The Jari 1.5 is Fuji&#8217;s high end model in the Jari line-up. However it is quiet hard to find for sale online at the moment. It seems to have been all sold out. This bike differs from the other two as it is built with a A6-SL custom-butted aluminum frame and FC-440 Cross full carbon monocoque fork. Meaning a lighter bike. But honestly I am a fam boy when it comes to steel adventure bikes so the cheaper options take the cake for me anyway. But this bike does come with a 2X10 Tiagra groupset which is a better option out of all the bikes. </p>



<h3 style="text-align:center">Fuji Jari 2.5</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">FUJI<br>JARI 2.5<br><strong>$699.99</strong></p>

<p>I personally like the look of this bike compared to all the others. It migth be partly that black tone and maybe the value in the price tag. You get a budget Claris, Altus groupset making it a modest component level steel frame touring bike. </p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>Thanks to </em><a href="https://99spokes.com/"><em>99Spokes.com</em></a><em> for the summary data</em></p>



<p>I have heard some people say that the Jari&#8217;s chainstays are too short. This will make it handle snappier as a gravel bike but if you plan to use it for touring with rear panniers you might have feet clearance issues. The chainstay length is about 435 mm compared to something like a Surly LHT at about 460 mm it is rather shorter. Weather this will be a problem is potentially personal, but something to consider. But if intended for bikepacking this snappier geometry is very enticing. </p>



<p>It seems that with the Jari, the geometry is suitable for what would be called &#8220;paved or gravel bikepacking&#8221; with bikepacking bags (saddle bag, frame bag, handlebar roll, gas tank etc). That shorter chainstay is suited for nimble handling that aren&#8217;t great for a rack. For loaded touring with everything except for the kitchen sink, with racks, panniers, fenders, tents, tarps and groundsheets, as well as a comfy camp chair, the Fuji Touring or Surly LHT would be better. </p>



<p>The bike is designed with a tall, slack headtube and seat tube angles which position the rider further back for more vertical compliance and increased stability at higher speeds. It is also nice to see that they have included a flare handlebar on this bike. The Oval Concepts 325 handlebar is purpose-built for gravel and adventure bikes and features a 25-degree flare in the drops to reduce wrist bend. </p>

<p>Another interesting feature that comes with this bike is the 2mm silicone shoulder pad on the underside of the top tube which is said to increase comfort when carrying the bike? Definitely would be helpful for those hike a bike section which require you to pick your bike up and over fallen trees on the trail. I see the benefit of that extra padding on the hands. </p>



<p>Maybe you are after that 1X gravel bike look. i have become a sucker for such a look! I have the Kona Sutra LTD and just love the look of a gravel bike with a 1x groupset. You can get this option with the Jari. I almost finished writing this article and missing the other more advanced gravel option in the Jari line-up. Depending on availability I would probably be prone to purchasing either the Jari 1.3 (1&#215;11) or Jari 1.1 (2&#215;11) builds. Yes they do cost a bit more then the other models but it might be worth it. And save a frame build!</p>

<p>It is such a nice looking bike, isn&#8217;t it? The picture bike is the Jari 1.3 all Carbon option in the desert sand which costs <strong>$2,299.99</strong> with SRAM Rival 1&#215;11-speed drivetrain with Hydraulic disc brakes. </p>



<p>Or you can get the Satin Navy Blue Jari 1.3 in the Aluminum frame and carbon fork combination at <strong>$1,599.99</strong> it comes with SRAM Apex 1&#215;11 drivetrain for quick shifts and a wide ratio of gears to tackle any terrain. </p>

<p>Gold gravel bike anyone? This has to be one of the hottest gravel bikes. You get Shimano 105 2&#215;11 drivetrain and Shimano 105 hydraulic disc brakes. Priced at <strong>$2,299.99</strong></p>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>The budget options are not up to the new 1x groups out there but the <strong>Jari 2.3</strong> and <strong>Jari 2.5</strong> setups are perfect for a newbie to get a decent steel frameset at a great price. The Fuji Jari seems like one of the best entry level gravel bikes on the market. </p>
