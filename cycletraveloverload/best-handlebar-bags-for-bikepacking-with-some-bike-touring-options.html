<p>When you are choosing a handlebar bag you need to ask some questions to figure out what style of handlebar bag will suit your bike setup? There are many different varieties of handlebar bags coming in many different sizes and ways of mounting to your bike. </p>



<p>I want this collection of handlebar bags to be cool and not your average normal and plain touring bags that every other blog writes about. If you want to go look at those type of bags they are all ready out on the internet and boring! </p>



<h3>Why have a handlebar bag?</h3>



<p>Handlebar bags are quiet essential when it comes to bikepacking and touring. But they offer great storage solutions for camping gear. A handlebar bag is great for allowing you instant access to gear that you may need to use while riding. More traditional designs allowing you to open the bag while riding are great so you can get your camera out and take that picture, or snack on foods while riding. They are also good at distributing weight around the bike. </p>



<p>Some people are bias to bikepacking handlebar bags, the roll pack options that require you to store sleeping bags and tent up the front where you could be storing gear i a traditional handlebar bag for ease of access. But you get the option to store gear in a top tube bag and other accessory bags on the handlebars too with these roll bag options. Which still makes them a great option for the handlebar bags. </p>



<h3>What to look out for when purchasing a handlebar bag?</h3>



<p>There are many thing to keep in mind when looking at handlebar bags! What are you intended uses for this bag? Are you mostly riding into town for commuting? Heading of on a short weekend tour? Going bikepacking on your hardtail mountain bike? or planning to ride for a multi-year bike tour around the world? Each bag is slightly more suited to all these types of uses for a handlebar bag. So what are things you should look for in a handlebar bags built? </p>



<h4>Size and storage capabilities</h4>



<p>What is the litre size of the bag? Some bags run from a few litres all the way up to 20L and more. Is the bag optimised for organisation? Meaning is there separation walls for storing gear in a neat manner? Extra pockets on the side of the bags and other areas is also very handy. </p>



<h4>Design and type of handlebar bag</h4>



<p>Handlebar bags come in a variety of different designs. You can get a standard bag with a top zip opening which is the most common style of handlebar bag. Then there is bikepacking bags that are generally designed with side roll closure. Like mentioned earlier require you to fill like a dry bag and roll up the ends. </p>



<p>Then there is handlebar harnesses with dry bags. These options allow you to remove the dry bag from your bike quickly much like you would with a quick release standard handlebar bag most commonly used for touring. While there is a harness that is always mounted on the handlebars. Sometimes these bikepacking style roll packs don&#8217;t work too well with dropbars. It is worth measuring to see how wide they are in comparison to your handlebar width. Which leads me onto the next point. </p>



<p>A great example of a harness plus dry bag combination is something like the Revelate Designs Harness and the Sea To Summit Big River 13 L Bag. </p>



<h4>Mounting on handlebars and fit</h4>



<p>When looking at how handlebar bags mount to a bike there are many variations. Bags like the Ortlieb touring bags attach with a mounting system that wraps around the handlebar allowing you to clip of the bag from the mount. Then most bikepacking bags attach directly to the handlebars with velcro straps and clips. Then the harness style, dry bag holders, can have similar strap designs that are spaced by a holster which allow room away from cables and holds the bag secure. </p>



<p>Bags like the large capacity Rando bags require an additional front rack system that helps support the bag. Again it is important to figure out the bags dimensions to see if it is suitable for your setup. Most bikepacking bags are designed for flat bars and are very wide, meaning they sometimes may not fit inside the space of a drop bar and interfere with your ability to use you bars. </p>



<h4>Waterproofing</h4>



<p>I have tried my best to include bags in this list that are waterproof some may not be 100% waterproof. But it is always best to get a waterproof bag for touring and other bikepacking adventures. although it is not a deal breaker. I would not dictate a final decision on a handlebar bag from wether or not it is waterproof. </p>



<p>This is a wish list if you will of my favourite handlebar bags. For the criteria of this compilation of bags they needed to be; quality, durable, function, have heaps of storage utility and be very stylish. Stylish is a big factor they have to look nice. After all handlebar bags are the face of your bike. Furthermore it was not a necessity but a bonus if these bags are waterproof to. If I really want something to stay dry I will store it in a ziplock bag. </p>



<p>So I asked around a hundred bike travellers what are the best handlebar bags you have used and can recommend? And in no particular order this is what they had to say!</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Rando Handlebar Bags</strong></p>



<p>Rando bags can make a great handlebar bag option. The aesthetics of these bags take me back to a time of retro bags where now days it just looks so cool! But besides how good these types of bags look. The big one that attracts me to them is their functionality. Many of them have a clear map case on the top of the lid, allowing you to put a map in there for directions, if you want to be a traditionalist. Even a phone for GPS works too! </p>



<p>The interior of these bags are just huge, there is so much potential with all the gear you can take along with you. Great for storing large DSLR cameras and other bulky gear. with these bags though they are supported by a rack. Compared to a traditional Ortlieb Ultimate 6 handlebar bag or something like that, it allows you to carry so much more weight. It moves the weight from being to top heavy to being a little lower down. It does effect your steering a little, but far less then if it was clamped directly onto your handlebar. Due to this weight these bags are best matched for bikes with a suitable front-end geometry. </p>



<p>The more modern versions of the Rando bags we are seeing some experimentations in the design, with detachable pockets and feed bags, that sit around tee stem. The Velo Orange Rando is a great example of this design.  </p>



<p>They are great bags if you are planning on using it for road touring, gravel riding, and they are awesome for commuting. Especially if you don&#8217;t need to much stuff, just chuck it in the handlebar bag and be on your way. </p>



<p>These bags are much more complex to fit to bikes that are not actually designed for them. For the type of racks that they are designed to work with these racks require eyelets on the forks that are on the mid to higher section of the fork. You may need to use methods of clamping to fit the rack to your bike. There is more hardware then just going out and buying the rando bag the price essentially doubles when it comes to getting a rack. </p>



<p>Rando back also don&#8217;t have a huge distribution like we are seeing with mainstream bikepacking bags. Generally you will have to go through small makers and availability maybe hard to find at times. May also be hard to go to a bike shop and get one. There is also a possibility of the rack breaking on really tough single track, rough terrain. Very uncommon but possible. They are best suited to medium gravel conditions and road touring or commuting. </p>

<p>One thing to remember with these kinds of bags is, they are more involved when it comes time to installing on your bike. You have to expect to spend some time fixing it securely to your bike. But pays off with secure attachment giving you confident when riding rough roads. The bag is fitted onto your bike with four velcro straps (on the bottom), an essential webbing loop that holds the rando front rack’s tombstone, and a decaleur (sold separately) which is the rack that is required for supporting this large bag. <a href="https://builtbyswift.com/rando-lexicon/">Read more if you want installation instructions.</a> </p>



<p>Depends how you look at it, but this could be a con to this handlebar bag system is having to pay a extra $85 to $120 on a Randonneur rack to accomodate your bag. However the massive storage capabilities for such a large bag is very welcoming. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1548" height="791" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hinterland_ozette_product_7.jpg?fit=720%2C368" alt="" class="wp-image-2784" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hinterland_ozette_product_7.jpg?w=1548&amp;ssl=1 1548w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hinterland_ozette_product_7.jpg?resize=300%2C153&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hinterland_ozette_product_7.jpg?resize=768%2C392&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hinterland_ozette_product_7.jpg?resize=1024%2C523&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hinterland_ozette_product_7.jpg?resize=50%2C26&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hinterland_ozette_product_7.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>Also in consideration when looking at this bag is to measure your hight inside your handlebars to match as closely to the hight of the rando bag you choose. Ideally so that it will be as flush with your handlebars as possible. </p>

<p>The top flap is designed to open toward the rider, making the contents accessible while riding. It also comes with the standard clear map case on the top of the lid. A great place to keep your map or a photo that inspires you. And it includes a shoulder&nbsp;strap, that makes it easy to carry the bag off the bike.</p>



<p>The Berthoud handlebar bag comes in three color options; classic blue-gray color, in black with tan leather edging, or in black-on-black . And they say that all the colors develop a nice patina over the decades.</p>

<p>Again for choosing the right size for your setup it is recommended to measure the distance from&nbsp;your handlebars down to your front rack. This available space, will be suited to the bag that fills it most closely. Available in small, medium and large.

<p>When it comes to pricing these bags are <strong>$290.00&nbsp;–&nbsp;$338.00</strong> depending on the size you get. </p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Harness and Dry Bag / Roll Bikepacking Handlebar Bags</strong></p>



<p>These are slightly different stylish of bag but I included them all in one section. These are the most popular handlebar bag options for bikepacking currently. Almost every bikepacking setup has a roll top dry-bag handlebar bar bag. These bags included are the most recommended by fellow bikepackers. </p>



<h2>Salsa EXP SERIES ANYTHING CRADLE + DRY BAG + FRONT POUCH</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="388" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/8e93a46d-739d-4f77-9544-31240fbfb776.jpeg?resize=720%2C388" alt="" class="wp-image-2790" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/8e93a46d-739d-4f77-9544-31240fbfb776.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/8e93a46d-739d-4f77-9544-31240fbfb776.jpeg?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/8e93a46d-739d-4f77-9544-31240fbfb776.jpeg?resize=768%2C414&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/8e93a46d-739d-4f77-9544-31240fbfb776.jpeg?resize=50%2C27&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Another great bikepacking handlebar setup option is the Salsa anything cradle. Combined with a dry bag and front pouch. The dry bag offers you 15L while the small pouch gives you an extra 1.7 L of easy access on the top. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="458" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/94162f11-8ab0-499a-ae40-2e1f75246954.jpeg?resize=720%2C458" alt="" class="wp-image-2791" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/94162f11-8ab0-499a-ae40-2e1f75246954.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/94162f11-8ab0-499a-ae40-2e1f75246954.jpeg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/94162f11-8ab0-499a-ae40-2e1f75246954.jpeg?resize=768%2C489&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/94162f11-8ab0-499a-ae40-2e1f75246954.jpeg?resize=50%2C32&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The one downside people think they would have with this type of bikepacking handlebar bag is the accessibility of the main larger bag. It is best if you store all your overnight gear in this dry bag, as it will stay dry so you have some dry cloths for camp. But also with this setup it is not a deal breaker that you cannot access the bag quickly as it offers the little pouch on top. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="466" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0b7693a4-080d-4db5-8323-8008bd377b56.jpeg?resize=720%2C466" alt="" class="wp-image-2792" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0b7693a4-080d-4db5-8323-8008bd377b56.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0b7693a4-080d-4db5-8323-8008bd377b56.jpeg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0b7693a4-080d-4db5-8323-8008bd377b56.jpeg?resize=768%2C497&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/0b7693a4-080d-4db5-8323-8008bd377b56.jpeg?resize=50%2C32&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Anything Cradle is a smart design allowing room behind so there is no interference with cables. So there is no fear of kinking, stressing, or otherwise damaging them. The Cradle is made from a 6/6 composite with 6061 forged aluminum arms. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="467" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dab0ab33-f159-4cdf-9489-78b3425c3ff7.jpeg?resize=720%2C467" alt="" class="wp-image-2793" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dab0ab33-f159-4cdf-9489-78b3425c3ff7.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dab0ab33-f159-4cdf-9489-78b3425c3ff7.jpeg?resize=300%2C194&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dab0ab33-f159-4cdf-9489-78b3425c3ff7.jpeg?resize=768%2C498&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dab0ab33-f159-4cdf-9489-78b3425c3ff7.jpeg?resize=50%2C32&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The dry bags are exactly that, waterproof, it is specifically designed to fit into the Anything cradle via a pair of Anything Cradle Straps. The dimensions of this bag come out the a length of 850mm and diameter at 200mm. The total weight of this system comes to 800 grams. And <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F117428%2Fsalsa-exp-series-anything-cradle-bag-pouch-and-straps">costs $200 for everything at REI. </a></p>



<h2>Revelate Designs Sweetroll with <br>Revelate Egress Pocket</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="328" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16171cd1-4116-4cc7-8305-f657c115cd98.jpeg?resize=720%2C328" alt="" class="wp-image-2795" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16171cd1-4116-4cc7-8305-f657c115cd98.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16171cd1-4116-4cc7-8305-f657c115cd98.jpeg?resize=300%2C137&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16171cd1-4116-4cc7-8305-f657c115cd98.jpeg?resize=768%2C350&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16171cd1-4116-4cc7-8305-f657c115cd98.jpeg?resize=50%2C23&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The Revelate Designs Sweetroll handlebar bag is another dry bag and harness option. The dry bag offers 14 L of storage space. Coming in at around $21 cheaper to the Salsa Anything Cradle. When paired with the Revelate Egress Pocket at 2.9L, they come into a total of 16.9 L which makes it slightly larger then the 16.7 L from the Salsa Anything Cradle. So just looking at these facts alone it makes sense to go for the Revelate Designs for the moment. Both very similar styles of handlebar bags. </p>



<p>The Revelate Sweetroll provides maximum protection from the weather as it is made from 210-denier thermoplastic urethane-coated nylon, that is RF-welded. So it is absolutely waterproof. </p>

<p>The weight for this piece of kit comes out to a total of 24 ounces or 680 grams. Which again stacks up to the previous bag making it lighter also. </p>



<p>I am going to try my best to compare all these bags as much as possible in these paragraphs. But if you want a quick and more visual take on the head to head of these handlebar bags, please refer to the table at the beginning of this article. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="376" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/172488c6-622f-4626-8faf-77012c3d7c92.jpeg?resize=720%2C376" alt="" class="wp-image-2796" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/172488c6-622f-4626-8faf-77012c3d7c92.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/172488c6-622f-4626-8faf-77012c3d7c92.jpeg?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/172488c6-622f-4626-8faf-77012c3d7c92.jpeg?resize=768%2C401&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/172488c6-622f-4626-8faf-77012c3d7c92.jpeg?resize=50%2C26&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>



<p>The dry bag offers a dual entry making it easier to pack from either side. It is fixed onto the mount with a quick release system which is a major plus to these types of bags. Allowing you to get the dry bag on and off easily. The mount is attached to the handlebars with a 4-point bungee attachment for a secure fit. It is also compatible with the Jones Loop H Bars.

<p>The smaller Egress Pocket that comes separately, with a removable foam padded liner. That protects electronics when the bag is removed and dropped at camp; liner features a small zippered pocket. The bag is waterproof. While also being able to convert into a shoulder bag (strap included), or run your belt through a series of webbing slots and turn it into a hip carry. Has a roll-down top closure. Also the side profile of the bag is slightly curved meaning that when the bag is tightened down with straps it contours around the main dry bag. This bag is also available at <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F117049%2Frevelate-designs-egress-pocket-handlebar-bag">REI for $69.00</a></p>



<h2>Ortlieb Handlebar Pack + Accessory Pack</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/handlebar-pack_accessory-pack.jpg?fit=640%2C427" alt="" class="wp-image-2822" width="545" height="363" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/handlebar-pack_accessory-pack.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/handlebar-pack_accessory-pack.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/handlebar-pack_accessory-pack.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/handlebar-pack_accessory-pack.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/handlebar-pack_accessory-pack.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></figure></div>



<p>The next handlebar bag in the mix is Ortlieb. They have been making some bikepacking bags and this handlebar pack and accessory pack is what they have to offer. Again another bag combination that is sold separately. I understand that Ortlieb are known for their quality products, but this handlebar setup is the expensive so far out of the roll bag options. But the difference with this bag is that the main large pack is not attached by a mount. It fits directly onto the handlebar. </p>



<p>So right of the bat it looses some points in functionality in the ability to take it on and off quickly, that is not happening over here! You get 15 L for the large pack and an extra 3.5 L for the accessory pack. Which gives you a whole 1.6 L more store capacity then the Revelate option. Also the Ortlieb pack dundle weighs in at a total 22 ounces or 620 grams, which again maybe due to no mount makes the Ortlieb lighter. </p>

<p>Okay so pricing. How much are they? Well the 9L pack is £80.00 and the 14 L £86.67 and the accessory pack comes in at £41.67. You can pick up their Backcountry handlebar packs for a little cheaper but these are not waterproof. And they sell one of the backcountry ones in a massive 20L. </p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Best Bike Touring Handlebar Bags (Traditional Style)</strong></p>



<p>I had to include some of the industry standard handlebar bags when it comes to touring, these are the most popular and overall best handlebar bag options, highly recommended by bike tourers all around the world. </p>



<h2>Ortlieb Ultimate 6 Classic Handlebar Bag</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="547" height="441" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultimate6m_classic_f3112_front-1.jpg?resize=547%2C441" alt="" class="wp-image-2845" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultimate6m_classic_f3112_front-1.jpg?w=547&amp;ssl=1 547w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultimate6m_classic_f3112_front-1.jpg?resize=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ultimate6m_classic_f3112_front-1.jpg?resize=50%2C40&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The good old Ortlieb Ultimate 6 Classic is a very common bag in the bicycle touring community. Made to be waterproof and reliably keep all your gear 100% dry. It offers all that you would need in handlebar bag with the plastic storage slot for maps. </p>

<h2>Arkel Handlebar Bag</h2>

<p>Another option for bike touring is the Arkel handlebar bag that is also only popular option, it seems these two bags are you better bets for touring handlebar bags. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="1200" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/large-handlebar-bag-inside-view-3.jpg?fit=640%2C640" alt="" class="wp-image-2849" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/large-handlebar-bag-inside-view-3.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/large-handlebar-bag-inside-view-3.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/large-handlebar-bag-inside-view-3.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/large-handlebar-bag-inside-view-3.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/large-handlebar-bag-inside-view-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/large-handlebar-bag-inside-view-3.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>A few things on this Arkel bag stands out compared to the Ultimate 6. A front zip storage pocket for extra storage on the outside of the bag, when the Ortlieb is just one large compartment. And you also get mesh storage pockets on either side. The mounting brackets on the Arkel are made from a strong, aluminum meaning that they will no break compared to plastic parts that are more likely to break. </p>



<p>Also the mounting bracket is adjustable meaning that it will fit most handlebars. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="600" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/large-handlebar-bag-with-quick_access-pocket-3-600x600.jpg?resize=600%2C600" alt="" class="wp-image-2850" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/large-handlebar-bag-with-quick_access-pocket-3-600x600.jpg?resize=600%2C600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/large-handlebar-bag-with-quick_access-pocket-3-600x600.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/large-handlebar-bag-with-quick_access-pocket-3-600x600.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/large-handlebar-bag-with-quick_access-pocket-3-600x600.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The bag sits about 6.3 cm in front of the handlebar. The large handlebar bag width is 27 cm. The closure on this bag is zip operated making getting in and out a little slower then the snap lock style of the Ultimate 6. </p>



<p>Cost <strong>CAD $234.99</strong> for the large handlebar bag option. </p>

<p>If you are looking for a handlebar bag to fit on your aerobar setup for touring, this is the one! If you have not read my article about bikepakcing with areobars you definitely need to check it out. I mention that bag in there. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1160" height="840" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apidura-racing-handlebar-pack-5l-on-bike-2.jpg?fit=640%2C464" alt="" class="wp-image-2841" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apidura-racing-handlebar-pack-5l-on-bike-2.jpg?w=1160&amp;ssl=1 1160w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apidura-racing-handlebar-pack-5l-on-bike-2.jpg?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apidura-racing-handlebar-pack-5l-on-bike-2.jpg?resize=768%2C556&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apidura-racing-handlebar-pack-5l-on-bike-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C742&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apidura-racing-handlebar-pack-5l-on-bike-2.jpg?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>It has these four loop designed mounting points which slide over your aerobars and sits in place nicely. The pack is designed for long distance competition in mind, but if you use aerobars for bikepacking, it makes a great solution to handlebar bags when bikepakcing. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1160" height="840" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apidura-racing-handlebar-pack-5l-interior-3.gif?fit=640%2C464" alt="" class="wp-image-2842"/></figure></div>



<p>The pack utilises the space beneath the handlebars to provide flexible storage. It has smart storage options for water bottles and a main compartment for storing a bivy or something like that. Giving you 5L of storage capacity. It costs £95.83. </p>
