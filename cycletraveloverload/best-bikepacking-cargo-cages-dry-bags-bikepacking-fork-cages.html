<p>Are you looking for some cargo cages for your bikepacking setup? I am, If you are like me this article includes some of the best options. I have been bikepacking single tracks and wilderness trails all around Victoria, Australia lately and my water bottle mounts on the forks are not doing a good enough job. </p>



<p>They are very limiting. I prefer to run 1.5 L bottles on either side of my forks. But the water bottle cages struggle to hold them securely. The riding is rough and after some gnarly sections the get so loose that they almost fall out. Good thing I tighten them down with some tie down rope (temporary job). And even one of my bottle cages snapped and pierced a hole in the bottom of my water bottle. Lucky I was on the last leg of my journey heading back into civilisation as 1.5 L of water dripped out over the next 50 km. </p>



<p>So now I am at a point were it makes sense to get some cargo cages or anything cages. Why? Simply because the versatility. You can strap water bottles to them, or a dry bag, just about anything! The way they are designed there is no worries about gear falling of you bike. I was checking every 5 seconds if all my gear was still fixed onto my bike which is not that fun, when you want to enjoy just being in the moment and riding. </p>



<p>They replace the need for front panniers and allow for some storage solutions without the need for panniers. Keeping with the slim and minimalist style of bikepacking. Cargo cages are great if you want to store even more water then you could with standard water bottle cages. You can carry up to 2.5 L or even more on each cage if you needed. </p>



<p>If waterproofing is important to you and you want to use a cargo cage for storing some dry bags this is a great solution. Allowing you to store sleeping gear in them, like a lightweight shelter, sleeping bag or pad. The 5L Sea to Summit Big River dry bag and Salsa Anything Bag are both good options for keeping your gear dry and protected. That extra storage can come in handy for extended trips when you need extra food. </p>



<p>With some of the cargo cages and dry bag setups if the offset is positioned right you can attached a bottle cage to the side of the cargo cage and have water bottles stored off the side of your cargo cages which is just brilliant!</p>

<p>This is my current bikepacking fork bags setup on my Kona Sutra adventure bike! As it has a triple mount option on each side of the fork. I use the Blackburn Cargo Cage with the 8L Sea to Summit Bags. In one bag I have my tent and the other all my clothing (one bike and off bike clothing). </p>



<h2>Bikepacking Fork Cages / Cargo Cages</h2>



<p>Most of the fork cages require a 3 bosses attachment option to the fork, if you are like me a have a bike that is custom build and not originally designed for bikepacking exactly then you might only have 1 eyelet of non on your fork. I wrote a article about the different ways in which you can attach water bottle cages to your bike and some of the attachments methods work with cargo cages. Also I will include options for suspension forks which wrap around the fork not requiring any eyelets. </p>

<p>By Blackburn these cargo cages are designed to free up valuable space in your bags and they are purpose built to carry bulky items. The cage comes with three mounting holes for attaching to your fork or anywhere else where your bike has eyelets. The rubberised straps come with it and in total weighing 164 grams (or 5.7 ounces). Made from a 6mm alloy tube construction that allows up to 4 kg carrying capacity on each cargo cage. This Blackburn Cage has some great reviews online. People who have used them have some positive things to say about them. </p>

<p>If you are looking for value for your money this might be a good option. They cost <a href="https://amzn.to/37ome6S">$31.95 each</a>. They allow you to attach an additional water bottle on the side. Are easier to fit to the fork and easy to tighten when you have all your gear installed. </p>

<p>Salsa were one of the pioneers when it comes to cargo cages or as they like to cll them &#8220;Anything Cages&#8221;. They have a couple option, but their HD Cage is a flexible carrying system for attaching lightweight gear or large water bottles to your bicycle. Attaching to your bike&#8217;s bottle cage mounts to expand your load capacity. It comes in at around 150 grams (or 5.3 ounces). While they also have there original Anything cage too. Which is the cheapest at $30 and the HD costs $35.  </p>



<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dsalsa%2Banything%2Bcage">Shop Now at REI</a></div>



<p>Allow up to a 3 Kg (6.6 pounds) loading capacity for gear. As these are not exactly a fork mount. The cage is designed to be mounted to standard water bottle cage mounts positions on in frame. You may be able to mount it on other areas like the fork but this will be dictated by the bike. Please keep that in mind before choosing this option. Best installed on a Salsa bike with Salsa’s Three-Pack bolt pattern. </p>

<p>Again the Topeak VersaCage is a very similar option to the previous cargo cages. However the differences are that this cage also offers a four hole mount design. Which means a height adjustment of your load for better balance. VersaMount clamps also provide easy installation and flexible mounting options. Which allows you to mount on your fork if your bike lacks the eyelets required for most other cargo cages. </p>

<p>A more minimal option is the Specialized Burra Burra Stuffcage with the Stuff Pack as a combination. You definitely don&#8217;t get as much storage capacity with this cage as the other above. As the stuff packs that come with the cage are only 1 L each. Great quality fork cage for bikepacking and dry bag. But if you are looking for a more affordable option you might want to skip on this one. The stuffcage is reasonably priced at $26.99. But the dry bag is quite expensive. </p>



<h3>Widefoot Cargo Mount</h3>

<p>The Widefoot is a aluminum cargo rack for bottle cage bosses. One of the selling points that is different about this cargo cage option. Is their 3×3 configuration of mounting slots allowing you to fine tune your installation at multiple positions on frames and forks that have three-bolt bosses. The cage weighs 71 grams and comes in durable powdercoated finish that is available in four colors. At bit more on the pricer side at $48.00 each. But they are made in USA so you are supporting local business. You also get the option to buy them with Voile Straps in the checkout. </p>



<h3>DOM Gorilla Cage</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="475" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Gorilla-Bag.jpeg?resize=720%2C475&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3848" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Gorilla-Bag.jpeg?w=970&amp;ssl=1 970w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Gorilla-Bag.jpeg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Gorilla-Bag.jpeg?resize=768%2C507&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Gorilla-Bag.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Gorilla cage is a more unique cargo cage in design. The base plate that mounts to the bike is not as wide as the other option. Instead it uses a velcro &#8216;spider webbing&#8217; design to surround and fasten your gear inside the cage. Making it best for storing dry bags. I could see water bottle being troublesome if they had a narrow base and could fall through. The cage uses a 2 or 3 mounting cleat that attaches to the bike. </p>



<p>It has a maximum load of only 2.5 Kg / 5.5 pounds, which is about 500 grams less then the better options. And it has a net weight of 70 grams / 0.15 pounds. It is not the best cargo cage out there and some people have mentioned it not being the best choice for bikepacking. The top three are your better bet.  </p>



<p>The Gorilla cage also comes separately with the dry bag to. </p>



<h2>Bikepacking Fork Mounted Dry Bags</h2>



<p>There is no one bag has to fir a certain cargo cage. In general you should be fine with using any of these dry bags with the above cargo cages of your choosing. I am just writing these lists to help you compare and figure out which of each combination would suit you best. You can use a number of different dry bags, like the Sea to Summit Big River Dry Bag 5L and below are just some of the options. </p>



<h3>Apidura Expedition Fork Pack</h3>

<p>Designed to work with just about any bike fork cage. The Expedition Fork Pack is an ultralight (85 grams) waterproof storage space. It is 4.5 L, making it deal for storing compressible items such as sleeping gear and extra clothing, as well as bulkier items such as cooking gear or extra food and drinks. Coming in at around $47.50</p>



<h3>Road Runner Buoy Bag</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RRB_Buoy_Bag_Olive_1_1200x-1.jpg?resize=411%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3847" width="411" height="600" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RRB_Buoy_Bag_Olive_1_1200x-1.jpg?w=662&amp;ssl=1 662w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RRB_Buoy_Bag_Olive_1_1200x-1.jpg?resize=205%2C300&amp;ssl=1 205w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RRB_Buoy_Bag_Olive_1_1200x-1.jpg?resize=34%2C50&amp;ssl=1 34w" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>More storage space is always handy when bikepacking. The more capacity to more food you can take and gear that you actually need. For some it is a struggle to find that perfect balance of storage capacity and sustaining a longer bikepacking trip. Especially when trekking into remote environments. These fork bags are perfect with 7.75L of storage each. That is the major reason why these are so attracting in my opinion. They cost $50 and come in a variety of colours. Also made in USA. </p>
