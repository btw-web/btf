<p>Before writing this article I have written blog posts about some of the best Gravel bikes under $1,000, $1,500, and $2,000. Which then let me to the best gravel bikes under $500. All those other articles are doing well and many of people are loving them. At first I was a little hesitant to make a under $500 list, because it just seems too cheap for a really good gravel bike. However consider these bikes are complete beginner options. Maybe you have just discovered gravel grinding and you either want one to get familiar with this style of riding. These bike are best for you also you don&#8217;t have to spend much money at all. </p>



<p>It seems like a smart idea to invest very little into a bike in the beginning then if you really like heading out into the wilderness and bikepacking some trails in the forest then you can always get a nicer gravel/adventure bicycle. </p>



<p>It is hard to find gravel bikes under $500! Yeah, I guess I could just find whatever I can under $500 and be done. But just like I always do I made sure to do a heap of research to see what other gravel grinders us and personally recommend from their own experiences and use of the bike. Being honest here! You can get some real lemon gravel bikes for $500. And even some of the bikes in this list are not that great when compared to a $2,000 gravel bike. Which is part in why I didn&#8217;t really want to write this article for a long time. So please keep in mind that these bikes are always going to have some kind of con to them as you get what you pay for. And 4500 is really not that much when it comes to a quality gravel bike. </p>



<p>Again I just want to explain a word of warning! Yes you can buy these bikes if you want. But if you put another $500 into your budget you could get a decent gravel bike that would last probably longer then these under $500 options and be a bike that would not need replacing overtime. I am really not sure how well these $500 bikes can be trusted with the cheap components and parts that come with them. You may also have to expect to replace some parts of these bikes with better parts. </p>



<p>Okay now that is out of the way lets have a look at some of the best gravel bikes under $500 that you can buy right now online!</p>

<p>Good old Mongoose! budget friendly bikes that are pretty good. I remember when i was a kid and I got a nice shiny new Mongoose under the Christmas tree one year! Oh those were fun times!</p>



<p>But this Adventure/Gravel bike is a good introduction to the alternative riding that is gravel and off-road stuff. All of these bikes are available on Amazon and can be sent to your door. This bike is unique . in that it comes with a frame bag specifically designed for this bike as the top tube has a strange upward angle. Also comes out of the box with a front rack that is similar to the Trek 920 front rack in design, not sure on quality though. It even comes with a integrated bottle opener which is cool!! You also get the option for additional rear rack mounting with the appropriate eyelets. </p>



<p>It encompasses a capable adventure bike geometry with a sleek alloy frame and steel fork, which is something that I have not really seem in a gravel bike before. Would be interesting to see how this bike handles with this combination. The bike is powered by a 2 x 7 drivetrain with Shimano Tourney and mechanical disc brakes. Just like the rest of these bikes. </p>



<p>The internal cable routing is nice to see on such a budget friendly bike leaving room for 3 distinct water bottle cage mounts. Plus some extra mounting options on the fork even when you have the front rack installed. </p>



<p>It has some pretty good reviews considering this category of bike is not the most quality that you can find. The frame is really good quality but the rest of the bikes parts are essentially junk. It does however make a good new cycle touring bike for that person who is just getting started. </p>



<p>This bike costs <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2DyZumR">$499.99</a></strong> and with all the bikes in this list you can get Professional Bike Assembly for a extra cost when you shop on Amazon. Meaning that you can get the bike sent to a bike dealer where they can assemble and check the bike for you. </p>

<p>Another cheap bike that is even cheaper then the Mongoose with a chromoly steel build. 700c Trieste Gravel Bike comes with 30mm tires and is equipped with Shimano Claris 16 speed drive train and STI shifters and disc brakes. To be honest it is not that bad of a looking bike. The frame aesthetics do look rather good. This bike as not sold that much on Amazon so I didn&#8217;t find that many if any reviews on this bike. It is priced at <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2OEMlPG">$439.99</a></strong></p>



<h2 id="title">Takara Shiro Adventure Bike</h2>

<p>If you are looking for a ridiculsly cheap gravel bike then look no further. i cannot promise you any amount of quality but hey! it is only <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2OGfDwY">$241.99</a></strong>. Built from a Tensile Steel Frame. With 36 spoke double wall alloy rims and big volume 700x40c tires. Also Shimano provides the 21 speed drivetrain with Tourney derailleurs and easy action Revo twist Shifters. I probably would not recommend this bike only because it is so so cheap, it scares me! Only reason why I really included it because well. I needed some more bikes in this article. </p>



<h2 id="title">Hiland Gravel Cyclocross 650B Road Bike</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="740" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6167CpqtcbL._SL1200_.jpg?fit=640%2C394&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4150" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6167CpqtcbL._SL1200_.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6167CpqtcbL._SL1200_.jpg?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6167CpqtcbL._SL1200_.jpg?resize=768%2C474&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6167CpqtcbL._SL1200_.jpg?resize=1024%2C631&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6167CpqtcbL._SL1200_.jpg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>This out of all the bikes here is probably the best value! You get a pretty good bike. It does lack a little with the gearing. Not sure exactly but it is either a 7 or 8 speed as it has a single on the front. Not the best for climbing when loaded but okay for just around town. But considering it comes with WTB tires which are nice quality, the rest of the bike does okay. The build is sturdy and ultimately the price can&#8217;t be beat at <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/34D4u5K">$437.49</a></strong> (considering how well of a bike you actually get for this price.)  Built from a aluminum 6061 frame, Gravel aluminum disc brake and quick release fork. Also for the price the bike kind of looks more expensive. </p>



<p>Out of this short list of gravel bikes under $500 if I was to pick the best two it would have to be the Mongoose Elroy and the Hiland Gravel Cyclocross 650B Road Bike. They are both fairly decent choices for a sub $500 budget. Just to get you started in the world of cycle travel. But please remember that there is much better bike out there. And I don&#8217;t want to be held responsible for you getting a bad bike, as these types of bikes can not really be trusted when it comes to quality and longevity. So please get them at your own risk or otherwise save up a bit and get yourself a nice sub <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/23-best-gravel-bikes-under-1000-budget-gravel-bikes/">$1000 gravel bike</a>. </p>
