<p>Everything on this bike is ready for a off the beaten path bikepacking adventure. It is one of the bikepacking bikes available on the market that really interests me.</p>

<p><strong>Update: Just wanted to put an update in here and let you know that dream do come true! I am now the offical owner of a Kona Sutra LTD 2020! So a rad bike that rides like a dream! A big thanks to the guys at </strong><a href="https://commutercycles.com.au/"><strong>Commuter Cycles</strong></a><strong> in Brunswick who hooked me up with this bike. I cannot recommend them enough if you want an adventure bike and you are in the Melbourne area, they have some sick rides! </strong></p>

<p>This bike was designed to be something similar to a drop bar bike that felt like a mountain bike and rode like a mountain bike but had the speed of a road bike. And as a result we have this beast! </p>

<p>This bike is made from an all steel both frame and fork. Which works well for added bump absorption and ride quality. I personally have a Surly LHT that I have converted into a gravel grinder, and think steel is the best for this kind of riding. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-Kona-Sutra-LTD_1.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4377" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-Kona-Sutra-LTD_1.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-Kona-Sutra-LTD_1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-Kona-Sutra-LTD_1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-Kona-Sutra-LTD_1.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Also this bike does come with powerful SRAM Rival 1 hydraulic disc brakes, a 1x drivetrain and beefy yet fast-rolling 700x50c tires. And also does feature a SRAM Rival 1 groupset. The 1X11 or 2&#215;11 drivetrain is a thing of popularity when it comes to bikepacking bikes. Although this bike does not come with the 2X train is is still capable at being a utility bikepacking machine. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bfg0rmgnasyy3ut4rlb5.jpg?fit=640%2C427&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4378" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bfg0rmgnasyy3ut4rlb5.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bfg0rmgnasyy3ut4rlb5.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bfg0rmgnasyy3ut4rlb5.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bfg0rmgnasyy3ut4rlb5.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bfg0rmgnasyy3ut4rlb5.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bfg0rmgnasyy3ut4rlb5.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>The LTD also does feature a wider bar with a 16-degree flare that made for more aggressive descending. These wider flared drop bars are the bomb! Something to really make sure a bikepacking bike has if you are considering travelling off-road for most of your adventures. This flared style of handlebars is great for added comfort on rough terrain and there are so many other benefits, you should <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-handlebars-best-flared-drop-bars/">read my other article on them if you are interested.</a></p>



<h2>Great Things About The Sutra LTD</h2>

<ul><li>The geometry works well for most types of riding types. It was designed from the Kona Sutra Touring bike but they made this to be a bike that merges between a mountain bike and a touring bike.</li><li>You get a nice amount of tire clearance. it comes with 700x50c but some have been able to fit up to 29×2.2″ without fenders. </li><li>It comes with the 73mm race face bottom bracket</li><li>The build kit is rather solid. We will go into much more detail about what makes up this bike. But it has quality drivetrain, crankset, tires/wheels and brakes. </li><li>All adventure bikes for me need to come with plenty of mounting eyelets. This bike does just that! Some bike really are limited here and only have rear pannier mounts or one fork eyelet. Which makes it rather difficult to mount a cargo cage securely. This bike has four eyelets on either side of the fork. And you get two water bottle mounts on the inner frame and one on the outside of the down tube. </li></ul>



<h2>Not So Great Things About Sutra LTD</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="498" height="374" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/84.jpeg?resize=498%2C374&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4380" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/84.jpeg?w=498&amp;ssl=1 498w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/84.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/84.jpeg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>This bike is made from both a steel frame and fork. And after some time riding some really rough terrain this can get slightly uncomfortable on a steel bike. It would be great if Kona came out with a carbon for option for this bike. Just to reduce road vibrations slightly and make the overall riding experience that little bit more fun. </li></ul>



<h2>Keep This In Mind</h2>



<ul><li>It is designed to be ridden under a load. So keep in mind that some people say that it feels rather sluggish when un loaded and riding on the road. but when you get your bike bags and gear on this rig, it ride so much better. For what it was intended! </li></ul>



<h2>Kona Sutra vs Kona Sutra LTD</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1260" height="358" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-16-at-11.04.33-am.png?fit=640%2C182&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4368" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-16-at-11.04.33-am.png?w=1260&amp;ssl=1 1260w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-16-at-11.04.33-am.png?resize=300%2C85&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-16-at-11.04.33-am.png?resize=768%2C218&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-16-at-11.04.33-am.png?resize=1024%2C291&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-16-at-11.04.33-am.png?resize=50%2C14&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>So what is the difference between the Sutra and the Sutra LTD? Well put simply the LTD is designed more for gravel/adventure cycling the includes mostly off-road riding. They are still technically classified as both being touring bikes. </p>



<p>Lets start with the more obvious differences. With the Sutra as it is built for long haul bicycle touring, you get a wider range of gearing with a 3&#215;10 Shimano Deore setup. This gearing allows for this bike to be so much better at climbing and descending. Which is very helpful when your bike is fully loaded with panniers and heavier gear then you would be carrying for a bikepacking style of ride on the LTD for comparison. Then you have a rear rack for pannier mounting, fenders, with Schwalbe Marathon Mondial 700x40c tires (better for road riding then the 50c on the LTD). You also get a Brooks B17 Leather saddle which is very comfortable for long days in the saddle. The handlebars have those traditional bar end shifters. When we look at breaking the LTD has Hydraulic Disc brakes and the Sutra touring bike has Mechanical Disc. </p>



<p>However the not so obvious differences with these two bikes is the slight variation in the geometry. The LTD has a slightly higher Bottom Bracket height at 10 mm more. This means the Sutra touring bike has a lower centre of gravity for better control when the bike is under a heavy load. This also make a 10mm overall difference in the stand over height. But that is the only difference in geometry. The prices for these bikes do vary from the Sutra touring bike priced at $1,499 and the LTD at $2,199</p>



<p>Now lets take a look in more detail what makes up this Sutra LTD bikepacking bike. </p>



<h4>Frameset</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="406" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sutra_ltd_frame-1.jpg?resize=720%2C406&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4370" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sutra_ltd_frame-1.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sutra_ltd_frame-1.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sutra_ltd_frame-1.jpg?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sutra_ltd_frame-1.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>As we discovered when comparing the Sutra with this Sutra LTD the frames are rather similar with a slight variation in the BB height. The frae is made from a Kona Cromoly Steel Butted frame with a Kona Project Two Cromoly Steel Disc Touring Fork. As we noted the fork come with four mounts on either side for plenty of mounting opportunities. And you also get mounting points at the rear for a rear rack if you wish. The frame color is a favourite this dark green just scream adventure.  Again you also do get a nice tire clearance for the stock 50c tires. </p>



<h4>Components</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-Kona-Sutra-LTD_9.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4376" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-Kona-Sutra-LTD_9.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-Kona-Sutra-LTD_9.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-Kona-Sutra-LTD_9.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2020-Kona-Sutra-LTD_9.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>There are a few components to go through for this Kona Sutra LTD, the idea behind mentioning what this bike is made up of hopefully will make things clear for you so you can do further research to see if these components are of good standard. But generally with any new bike the standard saddle gets replaced. And this LTD does not come with the Brook B17 on the Sutra Touring bike. This bike however comes with the WTB SL8 Pro saddle. A Kona Deluxe Thumb seatpost with a offset 27.2mm. The Kona Road handlebars which have a little flare. And a Kona Road Deluxe stem. As mentioned before you do get that RaceFace 73mm bottom bracket. </p>

<p>The bike is powered by SRAM Rival 1, the freewheel is a SRAM XG1150 10-42t 11 speed. So it is a 1X11 speed bike. And you also get a SRAM Rival 1 Rear Derailleur.  </p>

<p>The wheels are a WTB KOM Light Team i25 TCS with WTB Venture TCS 700x50c tires. A great combination for off-road riding. </p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Overall it seems like a great bike to chuck on some bike bags and go on a bikepacking trip for a few days. Cannot see why this would not be a good all round bike. With a almost identical frame set as its touring sibling. It would in my books be more versatile with its ability to ride the rough stuff too. It is one of the bike that I am considering myself. And it stacks up there with some of the better bikepacking bike options on the market. Not the most budget friendly bike but it is quality. </p>



<h2>Other Kona Bike Options</h2>



<h3>Kona Rove ST</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="428" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rove_st.jpg?resize=720%2C428&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4381" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rove_st.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rove_st.jpg?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rove_st.jpg?resize=768%2C457&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rove_st.jpg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Kona Sutra LTD is a great bike but for a little less money you could get something like this Rove ST. And adventure ready drop bar bike that is more then capable to get you where you need to go. Kona also has a product range of different Rove models that are definitely worth looking further into. </p>



<h3>Kona Libre</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="440" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/libre_dl.jpg?resize=720%2C440&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4382" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/libre_dl.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/libre_dl.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/libre_dl.jpg?resize=768%2C469&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/libre_dl.jpg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you want an ultimate adventure bike from Kona you could get the Libre or the Libre DL which are stunning looking bikes. But they are rather expensive. </p>
