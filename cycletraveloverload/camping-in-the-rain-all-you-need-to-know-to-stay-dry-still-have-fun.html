<p>Absolutely! We think there isn’t anything more relaxing or smug-smile-inducing than lying in your tent or hammock all cozy and dry listening to the rain. Plus, you’re not going to get all sweaty in a tent sauna or have the sun wake you up with your dehydrated tongue stuck to your pillow. And, even as an adult splashing around in puddles is still fun! But if you don’t get it right it can be the unpleasant and potentially unsafe.</p>



<h2><strong>What to do when it rains while camping?</strong></h2>

<p>The phrase: “by failing to prepare you are preparing to fail” &#8211; Benjamin Franklin, comes to mind. If it’s winter or rainy season and you’re going camping it’s best to assume it’s going to rain and if it doesn’t then that’s a bonus!</p>



<p>Firstly you need a camping spot away from rivers and slopes, you want to be high up and away from anywhere that water will run through. Ideally, you want a spot under some trees so you can attach your tarp. Then, you need to decide what can afford to get wet and what can’t. Is your bag waterproof? Have you got a good top layer? Is there a section of the tent you can store things in quickly if the rain does come? Can you create an outside covered living section? How much tarp have you got&#8230;you can never have too much tarp! The key is to stay dry and warm. If the rain comes when you’re not expecting it, having a little pocket poncho in your backpack at all times might just be the saving grace you need.</p>



<h2><strong>Are tents waterproof?</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stephen-meszaros-WWb4gn130JI-unsplash.jpg?resize=720%2C405&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6148" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stephen-meszaros-WWb4gn130JI-unsplash.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stephen-meszaros-WWb4gn130JI-unsplash.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stephen-meszaros-WWb4gn130JI-unsplash.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stephen-meszaros-WWb4gn130JI-unsplash.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stephen-meszaros-WWb4gn130JI-unsplash.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stephen-meszaros-WWb4gn130JI-unsplash.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>No, not all tents are waterproof. Most tents are water resistant but that means they may only prolong the trickle of doom. The waterproofing is usually rated by hydrostatic head (HH), however this only applies to the material used. The actual waterproofing of a tent is also in the seams, the quality of the material, design of the tent and whether the rain is going to get in the ventilation vents. All things you need to consider with waterproof clothing and accessories too. Although, tents are different. You may have a double walled tent. The inner wall should never touch the outer wall as this will cause water to leak through. This makes the waterproofing scales different to trousers that touch your skin all the time. The best way to know is to read reviews. You may also seal seams or add waterproof coating yourself if you already own a tent.</p>



<h2><strong>How do you keep a tent dry in the rain?</strong></h2>

<p>Where you camp is going to be very important in keeping you dry. Make sure not to camp near rivers or in valleys where you could be subject to flooding. Try to camp on higher ground and on a flat pitch. Camping under trees is ideal for attaching tarp and protecting from the wind.</p>



<p>Camping under a cover is your best way of keeping your tent dry from above. Try attaching some tarp to nearby trees or from your car (if you have one). Packing some paracord or bungees would be useful to do this with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most tents will get wet from the ground not from above. Make sure you’ve got some tarp underneath your tent and make sure it doesn’t extend outside otherwise it will just guide more rain in. Make sure nothing is causing the inner wall to touch the outer wall.</p>



<h2><strong>Hammock camping in the rain</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/andrew-ly-FhT10errXX4-unsplash.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6145" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/andrew-ly-FhT10errXX4-unsplash.jpg?w=3888&amp;ssl=1 3888w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/andrew-ly-FhT10errXX4-unsplash.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/andrew-ly-FhT10errXX4-unsplash.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/andrew-ly-FhT10errXX4-unsplash.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/andrew-ly-FhT10errXX4-unsplash.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/andrew-ly-FhT10errXX4-unsplash.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/andrew-ly-FhT10errXX4-unsplash.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Hammock camping is perfect for rainy conditions. It’s quick to set up and once you have your cover up you can work in the dry setting up the rest. You can store firewood and your bag under yourself to keep it dry. Naturally, you will be in an area with trees for extra cover and to attach extra tarp if you want or need it. You have to think less about the ground you are camping over as you won’t be sleeping on top of it. You won&#8217;t be subject to getting wet from below only from above, but if you have a decent cover you will be nice and dry.</p>

<p>Here are a few ‘must haves’ for camping in the rain:</p>



<ul><li>Tarpaulin &#8211; 3 large sheets if possible (one under your tent, one over your tent and one for an outdoor space for your fire)</li><li>Paracord &#8211; to attach the tarp to the trees and create a washing line for any wet clothes.</li><li>Waterproof matches &#8211; it’s not cheating, it&#8217;s sensible.</li><li>Swiss army knife (or similar) &#8211; to help cut tinder or kindling.</li><li>A decent outer layer &#8211; make sure you buy high quality, well reviewed waterproofs. You want to stay dry not have to dry yourself out after.</li><li>Waterproof bag, sacks and/or bag covers &#8211; high quality waterproofing is needed to keep your kit dry, and an extra inner sack for your electricals.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Camping in the rain activities</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Playing cards &#8211; not just for the rain</li><li>Singing around your fire &#8211; maybe a bit cliché</li><li>Reading &#8211; lamp on, in your sleeping bag all cozy, just perfect.</li><li>Board games &#8211; perfect time to sit around and get competitive.</li><li>If you’re well kitted out&#8230;go hiking! The rivers and waterfalls will be full and beautiful, a dip can be so refreshing!</li></ul>

<p>This needs to be under your tarp outdoor section. Let’s just set one thing straight, you’re not going to be the caveman creating fire from scratch that you dreamed of. You always need to make sure you have the ability to make a fire for warmth, cooking and drying wet clothes effectively. Do you have a little click-on gas stove? Waterproof matches or lighter? </p>



<h2><strong>Can you start a campfire in the rain?</strong></h2>



<p>Yes, but it is a lot more difficult than in the dry. You need a fire source such as waterproof matches and you need something that burns easily. If you’re camping by trees then get digging under the top layer of fallen leaves to find some dry ones. Or get underneath the bark of some fallen wood and use your knife to scrape shavings off. Whatever you use it needs to be dry and light quickly. If you’re a modern day camper rather than the more primitive type then you could buy some waterproof survival tinder that will burn whatever the weather. If you consider that cheating then that’s your opinion.</p>



<p>Next you need fuel wood. Collect this from what you can find on the ground, if it’s wet, scrape the bark off and chop it up to get to the dry bits. These will burn long term. Finally, make sure it’s protected from the elements.</p>



<h2><strong>How do you protect a campfire in the rain?</strong></h2>



<p>Yes, you guessed it&#8230;tarp! As long as you’ve got tarp, paracord and some trees you’ll be fine. </p>



<p>Tent or Hammock camping in the rain can be fun. As long as you are well prepared and focus on staying dry.</p>
