<p>Are you look for a gravel bike that performs like a road bike on the tarmac but gives you the versatility to take on gravel roads and maybe even singletrack. Allowing you to explore a little beyond the limits of the well ridden roads? </p>



<p>This article is dedicated to such bikes. What makes a good road gravel bike? It helps if you <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ultimate-list-of-the-fastest-gravel-bikes-gravel-race-bikes/"><strong>can ride fast</strong></a> on road to keep up with your roadie mates. (All the bikes included in the fastest gravel bike article are also listed below). </p>



<p>This means aerodynamic, stiff frame, lightweight,<strong> </strong>agile and responsive ride feeling and build around the idea of performance focused riding. This might also mean choosing a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ultimate-list-of-carbon-gravel-bikes-2/"><strong>carbon frame gravel bike</strong></a>. A road gravel bike might not have quite as much upright riding positioning compared to a more dedicated bikepacking gravel bike. But some of these bikes find a nice sweet spot where you can benefit from the best of both worlds.</p>



<p>Although these bikes are considered &#8220;road&#8221; gravel bikes. Most of them have gravel specific gearing, which is most commonly a 1x drivetrain setup. Which is not idea for dedicated road riding. Which is why road bikes have better gearing for sharp and steep road climbs. See the difference between road and gravel bikes here. Do keep this in mind when selecting a bike. </p>



<p>Gravel bikes do come with gravel tires from factory which are generally around a 700×40. This could slow you down when you want to ride with your mates in the early morning bunch rides. But what is stopping you from chucking on some roadie tyres and making it happen?</p>



<p>Along with riding fast, some of these bikes make the ideal <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-for-bikepacking/"><strong>bikepacking gravel bike</strong></a> which is what we are all about here at <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/about-me/"><strong>Cycle Travel Overload</strong></a>. But the thing is some of these bikes are not suited well for performance based riding you can expect in a road bike. Some may be too heavy and geometry too relaxed for all day comfort not head down and pushing out the watts. </p>



<p>Thats we we put together this list, giving you the best balance of performance road gravel bikes. But also some adventure road gravel bikes which are still good for those morning group rides with your mates. But also allowing you to go on big weekend bikepacking trips. </p>



<h3>Ghost Fire Road Rage</h3>

<p>A road bike, cyclocross, and commuting bike. The Haanjo is designed to balance stability and speed on and off road. With a stack/reach ratio of 1.54 (54cm) you know it has the upright geometry for exploring. Rolling on a set of HED Tomcat Disc 24h wheels for quick yet bomber attributes. With a budget option the alloy built coming in at just over $1,000. While the cheapest carbon options starting at $2,500 with the 6C, then they have the 7C and 8C.</p>

<p>The Topstone by Cannondale has to be one of the most off-road capable and on road comfortable gravel bikes. Available in a collection of different builds from the Lefty (women’s or mens bikes) which is a front suspension gravel bike to the standard Topstone 2, 3 or 4 with the BallisTec carbon frameset with Kingpin suspension. Which is a thru-axle pivot in the seat tube allowing the entire back of the frame to flex.</p>



<h3>GT Grade</h3>

<p>Built for road and gravel the all new GT Grade features that unique Triple Triangle carbon frame. The distinctive looks may not be for everyone, also it does have external cable routing. But you get mounts galore especially thanks to the fork. We recommend taking a closer look at this bike if you are after a budget friendly carbon gravel bike that is very much capable and fun to ride.</p>



<h3>Fuji Jari</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="436" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/191597960069b412577b6.00516062-1.jpg?resize=720%2C436&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7943" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/191597960069b412577b6.00516062-1.jpg?w=1326&amp;ssl=1 1326w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/191597960069b412577b6.00516062-1.jpg?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/191597960069b412577b6.00516062-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C620&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/191597960069b412577b6.00516062-1.jpg?resize=768%2C465&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/191597960069b412577b6.00516062-1.jpg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Ideal for racing, gravel riding and bikepacking. The Fuji Jari’s C15 frame comes in at under 1000 grams. Which they claim to be “the world’s first one-piece construction gravel bike frame”. The small attention to detail makes this bike stand out, with the armor shield under the downtube which guards against road debris and a Mylar wrap on the headtube stopping abrasions from handlebar bags. </p>



<p>The stock 700x43c tires are rather skinny for my liking, making them ideal for road riding, but you can fit up to 700 x 47c or 27.5 x 2.2” tires. It even comes with custom made, heavy duty bento box or top tube bag. The rear stay micro suspension also gives the bike 15mm of vertical flex to help dampen that road chatter.</p>



<h3>Jamis Renegade</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="414" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jamis-renegade-s2-383992-1-1.jpeg?resize=720%2C414&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7945" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jamis-renegade-s2-383992-1-1.jpeg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jamis-renegade-s2-383992-1-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jamis-renegade-s2-383992-1-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C589&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jamis-renegade-s2-383992-1-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C442&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jamis-renegade-s2-383992-1-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>

<p>An elegantly and uniquely designed gravel bike. The Merida SILEX+ really ticks most of the boxes when it comes to the road gravel bikes. It comes with 650b x 45c tires with the option to go up to 50 mm. The brakes have a disc cooler technology that draws heat away through CNC-milled cooling fins, which is very effective when the bike is under the load of gear. The Silex has the versatility to be a fast training road bike or a commuting and touring bike.</p>

<p>Last but certainly not least is the Salsa Warroad! With the top line model weighing 17.7 lbs / 8.0 kg. I was amazed by this bike when it was realised back in 2020, simply by its colours and design. It is essentially an endurance all-road bike. That is suited for 80% road and 20% whatever else! Compatible with 700c or 650b, the endurance road geometry positions you for long-haul comfort, and extra frame and fork mounts help keep you supplied for all-day ride.</p>
