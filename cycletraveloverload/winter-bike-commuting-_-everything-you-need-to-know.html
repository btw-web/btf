<p>Wanting to continue that work commute during winter? But worried if it is even a good idea? Is it doable? As the temperatures drop and conditions become less desirable for cycling. It is easy to make the decision to stop riding during winter and instead take the car. But if you do it right commuting in the winter is completely possible! </p>



<p>The two key aspects of a successful winter commute. Is your dress code and consider a bike with all that is needed to make you feel confident enough to get out on those winter roads. The right windproof, thermal and waterproof gear can make the coldest of rides comfortable. </p>



<h3>How to commute by bike in the winter and keep warm doing so?</h3>



<p>Below are a list of some of the main things to consider and some helpful tips for when winter bike commuting. </p>



<ol><li>You can use just about any bike you already have as a commuter. Same goes for gear. Just to start of with you can mix and match other winter clothing you have to see what works for you on the bike. Touring bikes make great commuters as they allow you to carry all you will need for the commute. Use <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/?s=bikepacking+bags">bikepacking bags</a> or <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/?s=panniers">panniers</a> to carry gear. Winter bike are essentially a old bike that you own, which doesn&#8217;t matter if it gets messed up. </li><li>If you have tried commuting already in the winter and the gear you have is just not cutting it. Then there is a number of winter cycling clothes and accessories out there to help feel more comfortable on that commute. Below we go through what to wear and also cover things you might need for your winter bike. </li><li>It might take some time to get right, but layering up is key when it comes to winter cycling. As the temperatures get colder the more layers will be needed and it will be a jungling act to find what works. As you will get hot if you have too many layers even if it is really cold. Ideally you want to be a tad cold when you head out the door in your gear as you will warm up on the ride. Find what parts of your body get cold the most and figure out what is needed. For me that is my fingers, and top half of my body. So I know I need gloves and a winter cycling jacket. My legs don&#8217;t get that cold even when it is really cold as they are always moving. Aso your ears and face might be another part that gets cold. So a winter helmet or winter cycling cap under a normal cycling helmet might be the solution. </li><li>Think about your route. When commuting in the winter some roads can be more challenging or not suitable to ride in daring conditions. Making sure you have a number of alternative routes planned or remember is smart. Trying to avoid main and busy roads when you can is ideal. And consider lights if you don&#8217;t already when commuting on busy roads to be seen. </li></ol>



<h3>What do you wear on a winter bike commute?</h3>



<p>Now all this gear below is what is recommend for winter bike commuting. And depending on the temperatures and conditions not all this gear is necessary all at the same time. Picking and choosing what works for what conditions is going to take a few rides to master. </p>

<p>A full out winter bike helmet is not always necessary but I great option if you are looking for a specific all in one helmet. That offers warmth, ventilation control in and out. And is not as bulky or heavy as some ski and snowboarding helmets. We have a couple <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-winter-bike-helmets-to-keep-your-head-warm/">favourite winter bike helmets</a>. But the <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/149000/bern-brentwood-20-bike-helmet?cm_mmc=aff_AL-_-8293-_-68229-_-NA&amp;avad=68229_a1bc74f75&amp;CA_6C15C=120217890006421102&amp;cm_mmc=aff_AL-_-204885-_-258061-_-NA&amp;avad=258061_d1bc91ab9">Bern Brentwood 2.0 Bike Helmet</a> is best for commuting all year round and you can get the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F160317%2Fbern-brentwood-20-winter-helmet-liner-with-crank-fit">winter liner for the Brentwood</a> (for an extra $30.00), which features ear flaps. Making the Brentwood 2.0 the perfect helmet for commuting in those cold winter months.</p>



<h4>Winter cycling face protection</h4>



<p>Alternatively you can just use whatever standard cycling helmet you have. And if there is enough room to fit something like a balaclava face mask or winter cycling cap under. This is another option. You might need to buy a larger sized helmet to accomodate for these under-garments, but not always. Some winter cycling caps are so thin and they still provide reasonable protection from the elements. </p>

<p>A proper winter cycling jacket is key for keeping warm on those chilly commutes. My personal favourite at the moment is the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=b5770911-39dc-46ac-ba0f-b49dbb30c5c7&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fshowers-pass-refuge-jacket-mens">Showers Pass Refuge Jacket</a>. There are a number of different winter jackets out there to choose from, here are some of <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-winter-cycling-jacket-for-commuting-bikpacking-touring/">our favorite recommendations</a>. The Refuge Jacket is designed for versatile outdoor use it is the perfect high-end commuter jacket for rides to work. I really like the magnet flap that folds down to cover your bottom to avoid getting a wet bum! And it gets style points from me!</p>



<h4>Best pants for winter bike commuting</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Men_s-Refuge-Pant-Bike-Commute-Lifestyle-1_5000x.jpg?resize=418%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5973" width="418" height="501" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Men_s-Refuge-Pant-Bike-Commute-Lifestyle-1_5000x.jpg?w=1667&amp;ssl=1 1667w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Men_s-Refuge-Pant-Bike-Commute-Lifestyle-1_5000x.jpg?resize=250%2C300&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Men_s-Refuge-Pant-Bike-Commute-Lifestyle-1_5000x.jpg?resize=768%2C921&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Men_s-Refuge-Pant-Bike-Commute-Lifestyle-1_5000x.jpg?resize=854%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 854w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Men_s-Refuge-Pant-Bike-Commute-Lifestyle-1_5000x.jpg?resize=42%2C50&amp;ssl=1 42w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Men_s-Refuge-Pant-Bike-Commute-Lifestyle-1_5000x.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Pants aren&#8217;t always necessary for all winter commuting. I personally don&#8217;t feel the most comfortable cycling in pants. But when it gets so cold it almost becomes necessary to wear them. My favorite right now is the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=92594cfb-2b30-40ba-ab76-f9c20ed4612c&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fshowers-pass-refuge-pant-mens">Showers Pass Refuge Pants</a>. With the adjustable velcro fasteners around the ankles it provides instant and comfortable fitting to your legs. And the zip along the bottom half of the legs make them great for fitting on winter boots. The waterproof breathable fabric keep you comfortable during that grueling commute. </p>



<h4>Winter cycling gloves or pogies </h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4859.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5974" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4859.jpg?w=5472&amp;ssl=1 5472w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4859.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4859.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4859.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4859.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4859.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4859.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you plan to ride in some of the most freezing snowy conditions, pogies r mitts are often recommended. But also cycling gloves are ideal for those average winter conditions. And are what I personally use for when it gets cold. I have a issue with my right hand. When playing footy a few years back I broken a couple fingers. and since then they have been stuck in position and they are not able to bend. This means they get limited blood flow when it gets cold. The <a href="https://www.showerspass.com/collections/mens-gloves/products/crosspoint-waterproof-knit-wool-gloves-closeout">Showers Pass Crosspoint Knit Wool Gloves</a> work great at keeping those fingers warm. (Also I should mention that Showers Pass are not sponsoring this post. But they did send me some winter gear. And I have had the chance to test them during Winter here in Australia. And their gear just works so well.) Anyway the gloves are fully waterproof with 3 bonded layers: a wear-resistant knit exterior that feels like a regular knit glove, a waterproof-breathable Artex membrane, and a luxurious merino wool lining that offers great temperature regulation as well as natural anti-microbial properties that keep stink at bay. </p>



<h4>Winter cycling shoes</h4>



<p>Shoes are not the biggest concern in cold condition. When it gets really cold like freezing then winter cycling shoes or boots might be worth considering. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-winter-cycling-shoes-boots-2020/">Here is an article</a> with some of the best winter cycling shoes. Also consider cycling base layer or thermals to wear underneath your clothing for an extra layer of protection then if you get warmer you can just take off layers. Such thermals are great for bike camping, I often use them for sleeping when it gets really cold at night. </p>



<h3>How cold is too cold to ride a bike?</h3>



<p>It really depends on who you are and your tolerance. But also what type of gear you are wearing. Most commonly around <strong>50 degrees Fahrenheit or 10 celsius</strong> is cold. I would consider really cold as near 0 celsius or 32 Fahrenheit (which is freezing). But at this point I would be very certain I know that that gear i have will work best to keep me warm. But if you wear the right windproof, thermal and waterproof gear it can make the coldest of rides comfortable. </p>



<h3>Is it hard to ride a bike in the snow?</h3>



<p>It can be challenging at times, especially if you don&#8217;t have the appropriate gear. Fat Bikes are considered the quintessential bike option for snow riding. But if you are riding a normal commute to work in the snowy winter streets and trails. You might want to consider some upgrades, like winter bike tires. </p>



<h4>Winter bike tires for commuting</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="418" height="376" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hs396_schwalbe_marathon-winter-plus-1.png?resize=418%2C376&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5976" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hs396_schwalbe_marathon-winter-plus-1.png?w=418&amp;ssl=1 418w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hs396_schwalbe_marathon-winter-plus-1.png?resize=300%2C270&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hs396_schwalbe_marathon-winter-plus-1.png?resize=50%2C45&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/15-best-bicycle-touring-tires/">Here</a> are some of the most popular bike tires for commuters or touring bikes. There is some bike tires here that are more suited for winter commuting. Like the <a href="https://amzn.to/2CdENPO">Schwalbe Marathon Winter</a>. They are very unique in that they have spikes running down the centre tread of the tire, best suited for riding on ice at minimal pressure. Against these are best suited for when riding on snow or icy environments, but they are okay to ride normally at about 80 PSI you almost don’t notice the spikes. </p>



<h3>Is it bad to bike in cold weather?</h3>



<p>It can be ad in the long run towards the condition of your bike. Which is why it is recommended to use a old beater bike that you don&#8217;t care too much about, if you can. Because after some time due to the bike being exposed to the elements it will start to, require maintenance to keep in good order.</p>
