<p>Is a gravel bike ideal for bikepacking? In my opinion just about any bike can be okay for bikepacking. Even the bike you have. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it is ideal. </p>



<p>Bikepacking can mean different things to different folks. The definition for me is essentially strapping bags to a bike and going camping, with long miles in between. </p>



<p>Some gravel bikes are very capable bikepacking bikes. And some aren&#8217;t so much. So what makes a gravel bike a good bikepacking bike?</p>



<p>It really comes down to your personal preference and where you sit on the comfort vs performance. Do you like to be super comfortable on bike? But also want the best performance possible with comfort? Like me? </p>



<p>Geometry is were gravel bikes can vary. Some are designed to be more cyclocross orientated, for racing and others can super sluggish and boarder-line touring bike. It seems finding the happy medium is where you can find that optimal gravel bike for bikepacking. </p>



<p>The bike for me has to have an upright riding position. This is one of the more important criteria. Some gravel bikes have a more road bike inspired geometry meaning lower stack/reach ratios. Ideally you want a gravel bike to have a 1.5 stack/reach ratio or higher for a comfortable upright riding position. </p>



<p>A gravel race bike will typically have a shorter chainstay and wheelbase. While a gravel bike for bikepacking will have a slightly longer chainstay and overall wheelbase. </p>



<p>Here are some examples of gravel bikes which are more suited to gravel racing rather than bikepacking. </p>

<p>Then you have these two bikes which are great examples of gravel bikes that are well designed for bikepacking adventures. </p>

<p>If we look into the details of these bikes geometries for example. We can see that the bikepacking specific gravel bikes have longer wheelbases and chainstay. Better climbing gears for riding uphills with gear on bike. That taller stack/reach ratio, longer front centre measurement. </p>



<p>Below is a comparison table taking a look at all these bikes different geometry measurements. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="711" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-06-at-10.49.30-pm-1.png?resize=720%2C711&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7158" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-06-at-10.49.30-pm-1.png?w=1302&amp;ssl=1 1302w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-06-at-10.49.30-pm-1.png?resize=300%2C296&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-06-at-10.49.30-pm-1.png?resize=1024%2C1011&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-06-at-10.49.30-pm-1.png?resize=768%2C759&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-06-at-10.49.30-pm-1.png?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>The bikes in the red box are bikepacking gravel bikes and as you can see in the black boxes the measurements are trending larger for gravel bikes more suited for bikepacking compared to race gravel bikes. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Along with difference in geometry gravel bikes best suited for bikepacking often have larger tire clearance. Although you can still use a road bike for bikepacking. Which goes back to my point that you can use just about any bike for bikepacking.</p>



<p>But if you plan to explore on single track and off to roads less roamed. Being able to run tires past 45c is superb. Ideally a gravel bike that is opted well for bikepacking will allow for up to 2.3&#8243; tires and even some 650b wheel can get 2.5&#8243; tires. </p>



<p>It seems racer type gravel bikes run 38 to 40 or even 42c tires. While adventure ready bikepacking gravel bikes come stock with 50mm or 2&#8243; to 2.2&#8243; as an industry standard. </p>



<p>Gravel bikes for bikepacking will also have stronger wheels. Again gravel bikes for racing have around 24 spokes wheels while rigs designed for carrying gear will have around 32 spokes. Resulting in a stronger wheel.</p>



<p>The flared drop handlebars on bikepacking gravel bikes typically come with more degree flare. From 16° to 24° flare, while race gravel bikes may have less, at around 14°. It all depends on different bike builds. But this more flare in the drops makes for more comfort and arm stretch on long rides. </p>



<p>Gravel bikes by nature tend to have underperforming climbing gears. They are not the best for climbing steep hills while the bike is loaded. They seem to be more orientated for speed on the flats and downhill, with all-road conditions. </p>



<p>But if you choose wisely you can find relatively good climbing gears on some 1x and 2x gravel setups. The better climbing gravel bikes that I have come across tend to have about 22&#8243; climbing gear which is still not 18&#8243; MTB territory. </p>



<p>This is what makes MTB&#8217;s a more ideal bikepacking bike. You can slowly slog up hills with an easy climbing gear even on a loaded bike. </p>



<h3>The Ideal Bikepacking Bike</h3>



<p>Unfortunately a &#8220;gravel bike&#8221; is not really considered the ideal bikepacking bike. If you want a rig that is dedicated to bikepacking you may want to look into hardtail mountain bikes. Some make the point that the flat bar offers better mounting options and it is part true that the flat bar offers nice and upright riding comfort. </p>



<p>But don&#8217;t get me wrong you can find some gravel bikes that have all of the above criteria to make it more bikepacking capable. </p>



<p>Here is some more reading about some of the gravel bikes we recommend for adventure cycling. This article takes a look at some of the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-for-touring-6-best-gravel-bikes-for-touring/">Best Gravel Bikes For Touring</a>. Which can be loosely related to bikepacking, however the main difference is these bikes in this article are best suited to carry a rear rack with panniers. </p>



<p>I am personally a big fan of <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/ultimate-list-of-steel-gravel-bikes/">steel gravel bikes</a>, this material is strong and forgiving when put through the test on bikepacking adventures. </p>



<p><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-gravel-bikes-under-1000-for-2021-budget-gravel-bikes/">On a budget</a>? Want to find a bikepacking gravel bike but don&#8217;t want to spend all your hard earned coin? Bikes like the <a href="https://www.poseidonbike.com/products/redwood?variant=35715148513431">2021 Poseidon Redwood</a> are the perfect option! </p>



<h3>Can you ride a gravel bike on singletrack?</h3>



<p>It depends on your skill level and the type of gravel bike. I would not recommend riding a gravel bike with 45 mm or slimmer tires. Even 50mm with tube setup you can expect punctures, especially on more gnarly singletrack sections. </p>



<p>It is very possible to ride on easier singletrack. If you want a challenge riding gravel bikes on singletrack can be fun! But again it is more ideal to ride a gravel bike, that has clearance for 2.2 or 2.3&#8243; MTB tires. Which helps tremendously with absorbing singletrack vibrations. </p>



<p>If you want to explore mostly steep, rocky, single-track terrains while bikepacking then a hardtail or full-suspension MTB is your best bet. However if you plan to ride a 33/33/33 mix of road, gravel and some single-track, a &#8220;well equiped&#8221; gravel bike is a plausible option! Meaning a gravel bike with all the above criteria. </p>



<h2>Best Bikepacking Gravel Bikes For Going Fast With Your Camping Gear!</h2>



<p>These bikes are ideal for those of you looking to go on fast bikepacking trips with your gear. This bike needs a stable geometry but also offer some agility for going fast and covering large distances if you want to crank out the miles! </p>



<h3>Salsa Cutthroat</h3>



<p>Drop-bar mountain bike, ultra-endurance mixed surface machine, tour divide inspire, bikepacking rig. The Salsa Cutthroat is your ultimate fast touring bike! Built with the ability to ride comfortably over huge distances with gear it is one of the best bikes we can recommended in this carbon touring bike category! </p>



<p>It is said that you can fit 2.4&#8243; tire with heaps of clearance for mud. This bike also fits the list to be a bike that can pretty much take you anywhere and also take you there fast! You also get all the mounting options one needs for a bikepacking trip. </p>



<h3>3T Exploro</h3>



<p>We put this bike in the fast category. But it could have fit nicely in all three categories. Looking for one of the most aero gravel bikes on the market?<a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/3t-exploro-full-aero-gravel-bike-should-you-get-it/">Check out the 3T Exploro!</a> The main idea behind this bike is to combined road bike speed and mountain bike toughness. So you can explore off the beat tracks and have the speed. The 2020 3T Exploro MAX option which comes with 650b x 57c wheelset but has a whopping tire clearance for 61mm <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/3t-exploro-full-aero-gravel-bike-should-you-get-it/">RAM</a> 650b tires. The Exploro Max Eagle AXS 1x has a capable gear range of 23″ climbing gear and 104.67″ largest gear.</p>



<h3>Wilier Jena</h3>



<p>The Wilier Jena has their all new 2022 model out! With prices as low as €3,000 for their 105 groupset option. The frame alone weighs in at only 1kg! Wilier say that the Jena was designed to give you more freedom of choice when you go out for a ride. Ideal for performance on dirt roads and single track, or adventure, exploration, and bikepacking. It is able to adapt to the many needs that gravel biking can have, designed to be a reactive and easy to handle bike, with racing-comfort geometry design.</p>



<h3>Salsa Warbird</h3>



<p>If you want the lightest bike on the market for riding as fast as possibile the Salsa Warbird is your best pick. Their fully specced out, top of the line Warbird weighs in at 18.2 lb or 8.26 kg and priced at $6,999. The bike is ideal for gravel racing, but would also make a perfect fast touring and bikepacking gravel bike. You are limited to 650b x 51mm tires. Which doesn&#8217;t make this bike as capable for going pretty much anywhere you want. It might be a better option if you want to stick to exploring gravel roads only. </p>



<h2>Best All Rounder Gravel Bikepacking Bikes</h2>



<p>These bikes can take you just about everywhere. But are limited only by tire clearance. They work well as bikes for commuting, racing, and bikepacking! If you are looking to spend your money on one bike that can be used for a range of sub-categories these are worth checking out.  </p>



<h3>Marin Headlands 2</h3>



<p>Marin make some great quality gravel bikes for budget prices! Not all bikes are designed for adventures both on and off the road. Whether you are a long-distance commuter or a weekend gravel grinder, the new Marin Headlands is a bike you’re going to love. Marin took everything they learned from their Gestalt X line of aluminum gravel bikes and incorporated that knowledge into a new line of full carbon adventure bikes. The Headlands is Marin’s lightest beyond-road bike to date. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FMarin-Headlands-2-Bike-2020">Priced at $2,649.99</a>. You get tire clearance for up to 700c x 45 or 650b x 50 making it an ideal all rounder. </p>



<h3>Cannondale Topstone</h3>



<p>The Carbon Topstone by Cannondale has to be one of the most off-road capable and on road comfortable gravel bikes. Available in a collection of different builds from the Lefty (women’s or mens bikes) which is a front suspension gravel bike to the standard Topstone 2, 3 or 4 with the BallisTec carbon frameset with Kingpin suspension. Which is a thru-axle pivot in the seat tube allowing the entire back of the frame to flex. If you opt for the Lefty bikes these could pretty much be a gravel bike for going everywhere. </p>



<h3>GT Grade</h3>



<p>Built for road and gravel the all new GT Grade Carbon Expert featuring that unique Triple Triangle carbon frame. The distinctive looks may not be for everyone, also it does have external cable routing. But you get mounts galore especially thanks to the fork. We recommend taking a closer look at this bike if you are after a budget friendly carbon gravel bike that is very much capable and fun to ride. You get triple mounting on the forks, and top tube mounting for extra gear. </p>



<h3>Fuji Jari</h3>



<p>Ideal for racing, gravel riding and bikepacking. The Fuji Jari’s C15 frame comes in at under 1000 grams. Which they claim to be “the world’s first one-piece construction gravel bike frame”. The small attention to detail makes this bike stand out, with the armor shield under the downtube which guards against road debris and a Mylar wrap on the headtube stopping abrasions from handlebar bags. The stock 700x43c tires are rather skinny for my liking, but you can fit up to 700 x 47c or 27.5 x 2.2” tires. It even comes with it’s custom made, heavy duty bento box or top tube bag. The rear stay micro suspension also gives the bike 15mm of vertical flex to help dampen that road chatter.</p>



<h3>Jamis Renegade</h3>



<p>A performance gravel bike, one that blends speed and control together to give you a bike that is just at home on road rides and bikepacking trips on more technical terrain. With clearance for up to 700 x 50 or 650 x 2&#8243;. With all the mounting points for racks, fenders and bikepacking bags. Starting from $2,599 for the C2, weighing 21.0 lbs / 9.5 kg. Designed for speed on all kinds of surfaces. Dropper post compatible.</p>



<h3>Trek Checkpoint</h3>



<p>This has to be one of the most sold gravel bikes on the market. Every gravel grinder and their dog seem to have one. So that means they are a great carbon gravel bike option than, right? The main feature of the Checkpoint is the lightweight OCLV Carbon frame with IsoSpeed, a decoupler at the top tube/seat tube junction that provides additional compliance over rough terrain so you can stay stronger for longer. A carbon gravel bike made for epic all-road adventures.</p>



<h3>Salsa Vaya GRX 600</h3>



<p>Featured in our <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-for-touring-6-best-gravel-bikes-for-touring/">gravel bikes for touring article</a>. It comes with a high quality Shimano GRX gravel groupset. Made from Triple-butted, Sanko chromoly steel and a carbon fork. The bike is powered by a Shimano RX600-11, 46/30t and Shimano HG700 11-speed, 11-34t rear cassette. Providing a gear inch range of 24.18″ to 114.87″ or 475%.

<h3>Bombtrack Hook EXT</h3>



<p>This has to be one of my favourite bikes in the list. It is a truely capable adventure bike. Up there with the likes of the Salsa Fargo but not quite as much tire clearance. Bombtrack describe this bike as the one to take you to wild places fast! With all the mounting eyelets you could need, forks, top-tube, rear rack and bottles. You are all set for an epic bike adventure on this rig! It come with clearance for up to 650B x 52C or 700C x 40C tires. </p>



<h3><strong>Canyon Grizl</strong></h3>



<p>Made specifically for gravel bike bikepacking! All Grizl models come equipped with wide 45 mm rubber with clearance to take up to 50 mm. Canyon have done a great job only including a balance with the right number of practical frame and fork mounts you&#8217;ll actually use. Apidura offer collaboration bags for your gear, that are fully waterproof highly durable packs tailored to the Grizl. </p>



<h2>Best Bikepacking Gravel Bikes For Going Anywhere!</h2>



<p>These bikes are your ukltimate adventuring gravel bikes! With larger tire clearance you can take these bikes on gnarly singletrack and explore even further then other gravel bikes with limited tire clearance. Consider these bikes as drop bar mountain bikes. </p>



<p>The bikes in this list have 2.1&#8243; tire clearance or wider! Just a heads up 2.1&#8243; is a decent tire clearance for a gravel bike. But I have only had first hand experience riding a gravel bike with 2.3&#8243; tires on some really gnarly terrain, which holds up very well. But generally anything over 2.0&#8243; is getting into travel anywhere territory.  </p>



<h3><strong>Salsa Fargo</strong></h3>



<p>The Salsa Fargo is a truely capable adventure / touring bike. Ideal for trail riding and dirt road touring. Coming with 29″ x 2.6″ Maxxis Ikon tires. It has those wide enough tire to truely take you just about anywhere. With a super upright stack/reach, long chainstay and large trail, all purpose built to be ridden under a load. My mate has a 2016 one of these and it is still going strong! Such an epic adventure gravel bikepacking bike! It merges the lines with being a touring bike. But it boasts the largest tire clearance out of all these bikes, so if you are choosing bikes based on clearance, this might be the one for you. </p>



<h3>All-City Gorilla Monsoon</h3>



<p>The Gorilla Monsoon is a beast of a bike. Translated to “Monster Cross-bike’ the Monsoon is one of those bikes that allows you to take it pretty much anywhere, from road riding to bikepacking gnarly terrain. Basically a beefed up all rounder. According to All City this steed can do it all. “Want to do mixed pavement and single track rides? Put in long days off-road? Do some fire road touring? Camping? Ride across the continent? No problem.” <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/all-city-gorilla-monsoon-review/">Check out our overview of the bike here</a>. </p>



<h3>Curve GXR “Kevin”</h3>



<h3>Curve GMX</h3>



<h3>Salsa Journeyman</h3>



<p>The Joureyman is Salsas entry level gravel bike option. As Salsa says, “The Journeyman provides features the cycling enthusiast is looking for to take on their first gravel race or their first ramble down that old ‘B’ road.” The Journeyman does come in two different tyre/wheel sizes (700c x 37mm or 650b x 2.1″). <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/salsa-journeyman-review/">Read our review of the Journeyman here</a>. </p>



<p>The bike’s Claris setup features the FSA Tempo Adventure, 46/30t crank and SunRace 8-speed, 11-34t cassette. When we calculated the gear inches accounting for the WTB Nano 27.5 x 2.1″ Comp tires. The result was; <strong>25.52″ for the climbing gear</strong> up to 121.23″ for the largest gears. With ratios of 0.88 to 4.18. When it comes to the Journeyman’s geometry, the <strong>stack/reach ratio is 1.54</strong> (getting very close to that upright and comfortable riding position for long days in the saddle). The <strong>trail is 64 mm</strong> making it feel predictable at the front and <strong>chainstay length is 440 mm</strong> , making it rather chill and ride like an all-rounder in the rear.</p>
