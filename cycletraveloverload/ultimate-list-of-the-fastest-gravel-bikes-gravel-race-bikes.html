<p>If speed is most important to you when it comes to choosing a gravel bike. All the bikes in this article will have you covered. </p>



<p>Gravel bikes are becoming more and more popular these days. Allowing roadies to travel where they didn&#8217;t previously dare on their road bike with 32mm tires. The gravel bike has opened up a new world of bike adventure possibilities, while also not sacrificing speed. </p>



<p>All these bikes had to meet our criteria to be classified as some of the fastest gravel bikes on the market. What is that criteria you ask?</p>



<p>An <strong>aerodynamic gravel bike</strong> is super important to cut through the wind, so these bikes have developed aero tubing and overall design. Allowing you to get the most out of the power you put down. </p>



<p>You could call these categories of bikes, <strong>gravel racers</strong>, the <strong>roadies gravel bike</strong> or even some <strong>all-rounder gravel bikes</strong>. A few of the bikes mentioned have received awards and recognition by winning some famous gravel races. They can also give you the speed you need on those wet road rides when you might need the extra traction. Some all-rounder gravel bikes provide speed and also the ability to carry all your gear, making the perfect light-touring bikepacking rig. The bikes we chose had to fit either one of these gravel sub-categories. </p>



<p>The weight of the bike obviously has to be light enough so you can go as fast as possible. Gravel bikes can be as heavy as 13kg but these bikes are mostly carbon builds and <strong>weigh around 9.5kg or lighter</strong>!</p>



<p><strong>Frame stiffness</strong> is rather important when it comes to riding fast, making the most of the energy put into the pedals. Some comfort can be sacrificed for that extra speed. However some bikes have ways around this, with intuitive suspension designs. </p>



<p><strong>Performance focused riding</strong> is the main goal for a gravel race bike. The make a bike ride fast these bikes have taken advice from good road bikes, when it comes to riding position and design. The stack to reach ratio might be slightly more relaxed compared to a road bike but not as upright as some more adventure focused gravel bikes. </p>



<p>When it comes to geometry these bikes can vary from each other. They still give an <strong>agile and responsive ride feeling</strong>. around 54 to 66 mm in trail lengths. While the chainstay length run from short to mid length or 415 to 435mm. When compared to road bikes they slightly differ in geometry, with larger wheelbase, lower bottom brackets and slackened head angles.</p>



<p>Know that you have some idea as to how we have defined fast gravel bikes. Lets take a look at some of your options to ride fast on all-road conditions. </p>



<h2>Ridley Kanzo Fast</h2>

<p>Combining gravel specific geometry, aerodynamic tubing and wide tire clearance. The Kanzo fast claims to be &#8220;the fastest gravel bike in the world.&#8221; We are unable to test for sure if it really is the fastest. But it definitely made the list for a reason. They are claimed to ride fast on any terrain and even outperform some road bikes at their own game. </p>



<p>Ridley really focused on designing the bike to make the most of all the effective power transfer, helping you convert every single watt into maximum speed. The bike has also been designed to cut through the wind while also keeping you comfortable&nbsp;for long rides. Each tube has an optimised NACA profile that was extensively tested in Ridley&#8217;s wind tunnel. The bike also features a lowered seat stay for vertical compliance. </p>



<h2>Open U.P.P.E.R</h2>

<p>The third generation U.P. &amp; U.P.P.E.R bikes offer standard performance gravel bike features. Such as dual wheel size compatibility and a dropped chainstay. These bikes find that balance between road bike speed plus go-anywhere capabilities. Making them fast but also able to go on rad adventures. The idea behind the U.P.P.E.R bikes is the option to run multiple tire setups. Road tires to make it a very fast road bike, turn it into a go-anywhere bike with gravel tires 32-40mm or run 650b mountain bike tires allowing it to be pretty much unstoppable. It does feature a road riding position for that extra speed even if you run MTB tires. Meaning you can get to the trails faster. Weighing just under 8 kg! </p>
