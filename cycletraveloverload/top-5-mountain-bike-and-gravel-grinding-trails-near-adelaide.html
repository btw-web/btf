<p>More well known for its food and festival culture this Southern Australian gem actually has some pretty decent off road riding too. Adelaide sits on the south coast of Australia only a 90 minute flight (or an 8 hour drive) from me in Melbourne. </p>



<p>It’s home to some of Australia’s best wine and arts culture. It’s also home to the Adelaide hills which lend themselves to great off-road riding options. If you want to venture off into the state then you can find some decent trails in the Flinders Ranges too. </p>



<p>However, I’m going to focus closer to the city to benefit those of us who will be staycation-ing in the area and may be limited on time. Well mostly. </p>



<p>The last one I couldn’t resist, it’s a bit of me and I will definitely be doing this one when the borders open up.</p>



<p>Mountain biking in and around Adelaide is accessible and beautiful. Most trails can be done on a basic front suspension bike but if you want to get to the most out of the purpose built parks then having a full suspension bike is advised.</p>

<p>I’m starting at a locals favourite just 30 mins North of Adelaide CBD. This is a recreation park for hikers, bikers, BMX riders and runners alike. There’s jumps, ruins, lookouts, rocks, murals, obstacles, flow and wildlife all in one place. </p>



<p>There’s toilets, BBQs and decent parking so you can bring your family or friends for the afternoon. It mainly consists of longer blue runs with a couple of black and red options thrown in for good measure. </p>



<p>It’s a great place for families and beginners or this wanting a swift pump before or after work! </p>



<p>Bear in mind, it can be popular here so if you’re wanting the peace and quiet of barren trails you might need to think twice before you come on a sunny weekend.</p>

<p>Often referred to as ‘Devils Gully’ these trails used to be a well kept secret in the local MTB world, but due to some trail closures after the fires more and more people are discovering the trails here. </p>



<p>It isn’t as well signposted as some trails but that’s part of its beauty. There are only a handful of trails here and all require some previous experience. </p>



<p>The tracks are a bit rugged but good fun for the more adventurous rider. There’s some good downhill and jump sections, some rooty and rocky climbs mixed in with some sharp cornered descents. Just good fun all round.</p>

<p>If you go about 13km South from the CBD you’ll find the beauty conservation area of Sturt Gorge. This area contains Craigburn Farm trails too. </p>



<p>This area is good for longer flowy trails rather than techy skills work. It has over 40km of XC trails mostly Green and Blue rated when you link up all the areas nearby. </p>



<p>The Sturt Gorge is only 8km of the whole network sound here. The trails here were mostly built by hand due to the restrictions on machinery to protect the natural habitats. </p>



<p>That means there’s lots of great natural features remaining like rocky outcrops and obstacles.</p>

<p>This park sits about 12km from the city and has good parking and access. It was designed with government, environmental and cycling heads all together to make use of a disused quarry site and the results are pretty good! </p>



<p>There is over 20km of XC trail, DH track, skills and jumps parks and lots of flowy nice trails with spectacular views. </p>



<p>The variety of trails here is excellent and they have some really good high level riding too, a lot of rocks and techy obstacles to keep you guessing and some easier flowy runs for beginners too.</p>

<p>OK, so this isn’t a MTB trail network or park it&#8217;s a bikepacking route. It’s 900km of bikepacking route starting just East of Adelaide and going up to the Flinders ranges. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s made up of old unused unsealed back roads, fire roads, farm roads and forest tracks. It should take around 2 weeks giving you time to stop and have a wine or 2 in the Barossa Valley (you can’t not). </p>



<p>There are some decent climbs and impressive scenery the whole way, especially as you get up to the northern section in the mountain ranges. Probably best to do this ride outside of the summer months as it can get a bit unbearably hot then. </p>



<p>The whole route is signposted and is backed by government funding so is pretty well maintained, that’s not to say it takes some pretty obscure routes to get to certain points but that’s fine, that’s what bikepacking is about!</p>



<p>OK so I’m going to just tell you a little bit about the Flinders ranges MTB trails now we’ve hypothetically cycled all the way there on the Mawson Trail.</p>

<p>So this is a pretty tough 200km ride through the ranges that links up with the end of the Mawson Trail. It takes in some of South Australia’s most beautiful scenery and wildlife. </p>



<p>You don’t have to do the full 200km, there are route options around 50km each that wind through the ranges from local nearby towns. </p>



<p>Be aware there are fees associated with using the trail so check on the linked website before going. They offer luggage transfer if you haven’t got your bikepacking bags with you too!</p>



<p>So there we have it, my top 5 (or 6) mountain biking trails around Adelaide and South Australia. There’s some really fun ones in there and it seems. a great place for beginners to get into the sport too. </p>



<p>The South Australia government seem to have done a good job making the trails accessible and attractive to all abilities, and even having an off road wine tour circuit! Amazing! </p>
