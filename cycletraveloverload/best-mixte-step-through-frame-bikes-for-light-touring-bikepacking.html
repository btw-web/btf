<p>Are you after a step-through touring bike? These can be great for anyone who prefers to lower top tube heights and ease when it comes to getting on and off the bike. Back in the day these types of bikes were marketed to women.</p>



<p>If you are a adventures lady looking for that one bike for touring and bikepacking. Yes these bikes are a good place to start. If you really want a bike with a step-through frame then read on. But if you want some other &#8220;women&#8221; bike options, that are more designed as gravel bikes. With shorter reach and lower stand over heights. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/11-best-womens-gravel-bikes-in-2020/">I recommend you give this article a look!</a> </p>



<p>Womens bikes are becoming a thing of the past but if you want to learn more about some of the basic differences between what marketers call a mens and womens bikes. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/difference-between-mens-and-womens-bikes/">This might be of some interest to.</a> </p>



<p>What are some of the advantages of step-through bikes? Why would you even want to consider this type of bike?</p>



<ul><li>Very easy and quick to mount and dismount the bike. Making it a great bike for long tours when you are stopping many times.</li><li>Also more suitable for elderly people and others with restricted agility.</li><li>Also so say it is potentially safer than a &#8220;normal&#8221; framed bike with the quick access to dismount bike. </li><li>They have a more comfortable and relaxed, upright positioning for the rider then some other more aggressive bikes. </li><li>Then you have personally preference, some riders just like this style and feel of bike. </li></ul>



<p>Yes, there are some good reasons to consider a step-through frame bike. But what are some of the disadvantages?</p>



<ul><li>They can be heavier than most other touring frame bikes. Due to the step-through design it requires thicker tubing for added strength. </li><li>The design of the frame can be weaker due to its nature. Which can lead to excessive flexing, resulting in lower pedaling efficiency and reduced frame life. </li><li>Due to the sloped tubing being lower to the ground it can make the bike more difficult to carry.</li><li>Also limited areas on the bike for mounting gear, like water bottles and racks. </li></ul>



<p>When looking for a step-through bike for touring or bikepacking, more so touring. You want to make sure that it has some of these attributes. Not all is important. Like a rear rack mounts you could just add bikepacking bags instead. But ideally it is best if the bike has all these things. </p>



<ul><li>Relaxed geometry that is appropriate for long days n the saddle offering comfort. </li><li>A wide range of gears. </li><li>Eyelets to mount rear and/or front racks so you can attach panniers. Along with fender mounts if you really want. </li></ul>



<p>These are the most important things to consider. But what is the difference between a Mixte vs a step-through frame bike? They are often used interchangably but they have some differences. </p>



<p>A Mixte bike is often thought as to have a more road geometry which means you can use them with drop bars if that is your thing. While a step-through is generally designed more upright for city riding. Old Mixte frames are limited with 110mm dropouts which do limit wheel choice. It definitely would be a cool protect to get a frame to build out a nice Mixte or step-through rig. </p>



<p>Below I have put together a short list of some of the most popular and highly recommended step-through and Mixte bikes that can be used for bikepacking and some light touring. Some only come as framesets only. </p>

<p>A true Mixte bike with the double top tube tubing which Mixte bikes are so famous for. You get lots of standover height obviously mashed with some style. The geometry is more sporty, than upright-comfy. With all the rear rack and fender mounts you need for a light tour. <a href="https://www.somafab.com/archives/product/buena-vista-disc-frame-set">Priced from </a><strong><a href="https://www.somafab.com/archives/product/buena-vista-disc-frame-set">$629.99</a></strong><a href="https://www.somafab.com/archives/product/buena-vista-disc-frame-set"> for frameset only</a>.</p>

<p>A very stylish step-through frame. Kona make some great bikes and I love my Sutra LTD. But this Kona Coco pays homage to the gorgeous European step-through bicycle. With a redesigned frame improving fit and ride quality. With internal routing keeping the lines clean and sleek. With a 39t front chainring with guard and a Shimano HG200 11-32t 9spd freewheel. Comes with adequate rack mounts and fenders. <a href="https://www.konaworld.com/coco.cfm">Priced at $1,299 AUD</a></p>



<h2>Crust Step-Thru Evasion</h2>

<p>This might be my most favorite step-through bike frame for bikepacking. Crust make some really rad rigs and this Evasion is no different. The Evasion frame is designed around 26+ (26″ x 2.8 can also fit 3″.) &nbsp;tires on 45mm rims, for when you want to take those roads less traveled. But can also fit 650b tires (27.5″) up to x 2.4. It is best for comfortable for the long haul, but fast and nimble, while still being ready for some pretty technical/rough riding. rack mounts and water bottle bosses with a long head tube for the most comfortable position. <a href="https://jambijambi.com/products/crust-evasion?fbclid=IwAR2lJvNEkRYMLuWEoo30V0u4M0yq5KsbxtRipUzVQZ3nWfmk03Q60loa2XY">Price is $950.00 for frameset only.</a></p>
