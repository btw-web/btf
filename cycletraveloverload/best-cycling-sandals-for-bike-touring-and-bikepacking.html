<p>Maybe you are like me and rather wear sandals when on tour or bikepacking, then having your feet fully covered by shoes. Not have the right shoes can stop our feet from airing out properly. It seems like a better idea in my opinion to wear sandals. I love wearing thongs or flip flops when I am on tour, I get strange looks all the time. But since I am wanting to do some more bikepacking off-road riding I want to get footwear for keeping my feet aerated but I don&#8217;t want to risk it with thongs. The best alternative to this problem is cycling sandals. </p>



<p>Since I am in the market for a pair myself I search all over the web for the best cycling sandals that are the best for bikepacking and bike touring too. And I ask mani bike travellers what they use and can recommend from their experience. Below is a quick list of all the best options. </p>



<p>When looking for a pair of cycling sandals you want to make sure you get a pair that is comfortable. And is ideally going to work for riding and short hikes if you are heading off on a bikepacking adventure. </p>



<p>Cycling sandals are a much better choice than shoes for biking in heat and rain. Even in cold weather add fleece socks or waterproof socks. I just personally prefer the feeling of the wind in my toes!</p>



<p>So without any more talking here they are, the best cycling sandals!</p>

<h2>Shimano SD5</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4dd4fee3-03a2-43db-ad2b-7187c09d122e.jpeg?resize=491%2C325" alt="" class="wp-image-3255" width="491" height="325" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4dd4fee3-03a2-43db-ad2b-7187c09d122e.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4dd4fee3-03a2-43db-ad2b-7187c09d122e.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4dd4fee3-03a2-43db-ad2b-7187c09d122e.jpeg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4dd4fee3-03a2-43db-ad2b-7187c09d122e.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>These current model Shimano SD5 cycling sandals, have a much more flexible sole than the older SD66L or any of the ones before that. Which you may or may not prefer. Meaning that it might be uncomfortable while riding as some have said. Some have said that there is not enough support in the footbed. The sole is very soft that results in hot spots as the pedal deforms it and obvious pressure points on the feet. It does make it better for walking. They work great for biking and walking around town and camp. But depending on your tolerance they might not be best for you, I personally use minimal shoes for running and are thinking about getting these compared to the other models, the major factor being that these are durable and are know to last a longer time them most other options. </p>



<p>SPD sandals are comfortable and wear well. A bike tourer said that they are on their second pair in a decade. When you look at it that is a pretty good run. Your feet do collect a lot of dirt, though, so you need to wash before getting into your sleeping bag, or wash the liner more frequently. You may get a tanned imprint on your feet. </p>



<p>These sandals do lack the stiffness again like I mentioned earlier when on the bike. It&#8217;s a trade-off and different people will have different priorities. If you get on okay with the softness of the sole (and it&#8217;s no softer than any regular shoe it&#8217;s just not stiff like a bike-specific shoe) then they would be great general purpose for both on and off the bike for a tour. </p>



<p>One user of these sandals have claimed that they are wired and clunky and give me blisters which is exactly why I try to wear sandals, to avoid discomfort and blisters! In all respect this is uncommon, and might be a sizing issue. </p>



<p>One of the great things about Shimano is their stuff lasts longer then most other options on the market. These sandals do have a similar flexibility of the Keen Commuters sole (mentioned below), the new Shimano SD5 is similar to that, it&#8217;s much less stiff than the older Shimano sandals.</p>



<p>Overall they are comfortable, quick drying and very suitable for walking around in. But they do lack some on bike riding comfort, due to not being stiff enough. They seem a better option if you are planning to go bikepacking and do heaps of hike a bike, with the sandals flexibility they sound best suited to the demands. </p>



<h2>Keen Commuters</h2>

<p>These Keens Sandals although named the commuters can not only be used for just that. They make a great sandal for anyone looking to use them for a cross country bike trip. The are additionally great for walking around on foot in towns when touring, this multipurpose is something to look for in a touring or bikepacking shoe. </p>



<p>Depending on your shoe size and the width you may need to get half a size up then normal. It is recommend going to the store and trying them on before you choose the size. </p>



<p>These look narrow however they are not. They also don&#8217;t have the same feel as normal Keen sandals, but they do sure a specific purpose. For walking around that don&#8217;t feel like a normal Keen sandal but they are also not incredibly flexible, sacrificing on bike comfort. </p>



<p>These sandals are a popular option, seems a 50/50 split with these and the previous Shimanos. However the thing with the Keens is their availability, you will struggle to find any online, especially in a mens size. I believe they have stopped making them and they are in and out of production. As for now since writing this post they are very hard to find. </p>



<p>Keen stopped making them too. One thing that these keens have going for them compared to the Shimanos is the toe protection. But the Keens have a problem with durability and don&#8217;t seem to last as long as Shimano. Users have reported that the Keens soles cracked and broke. The Keens are nice but they also do take a while to dry out. </p>



<h2 id="title">Exustar E-SS503</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/91H4jw086VL._SL1500_.jpg?fit=640%2C329" alt="" class="wp-image-3267" width="524" height="269" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/91H4jw086VL._SL1500_.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/91H4jw086VL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/91H4jw086VL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C395&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/91H4jw086VL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=1024%2C527&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/91H4jw086VL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=50%2C26&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/91H4jw086VL._SL1500_.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Exustar are another cycling sandal option that is slightly on the cheaper side. Depending on what size you are, the prices fluctuate. However the next sandals might just take the cake for the most affordable cycling sandal available on the market and recommended by fellow bike travellers. </p>



<p>Depending on what you like in terms of shoe flexibility. For me I like something that is somewhere in the middle or more flexible like the Shimanos mentioned in the beginning. But these sandals are more on the stiff sole side. Making them better for cycling efficiency on the bike but long hikes and hike a bike stuff not so favoured. Customers who have issues with their feet where they need less flexibility. Like a dorsal bunion or something like that. They offer that support while walking. </p>



<p>The sandal has a great design, they are very comfortable and fit great all around. However some users have reported craftsmanship issues with these sandals. They claimed that the out sole of the shoe fell off after only 30 days of light commuting, the shoe glue is not that great. </p>



<p>These sandals are closed toe, again depending on your preferences, unlike the Shimano ones, there maybe some piece of mind there. The main purpose is cycling not walking, you may not want to walk around in these sandals all day. While it is far cooler than traditional cycling shoes, it covers far more of the foot than ordinary sandals. This allows you to have the good tight fit you need to transfer power to the pedals for cycling. </p>



<h2 id="product-title">Nashbar Ragster II</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-22-at-11.04.49-am.png?resize=515%2C390" alt="" class="wp-image-3268" width="515" height="390" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-22-at-11.04.49-am.png?w=683&amp;ssl=1 683w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-22-at-11.04.49-am.png?resize=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-22-at-11.04.49-am.png?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Nashbar are overall the cheapest pair of sandals in this list coming in at only $69.99 at Nashbar.com. The sandals strap down tight and fit well with or without socks. Some users of these sandals have claimed that these sandals have rough footbed. But then others have said that the footbed is fairly comfortable even without socks too. </p>



<p>The Nashbar sandals comes with a toe guard over the front of the sandal. They are not the most comfortable and flexible when it comes to walking in these sandals. As it seems they are another stiff sandal option that is better for mainly cycling. </p>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Overall since research all these sandals listed about and looking further into the bike travellers recommendations. I have come to the conclusion, that I will be investing a little be more into some sandals that have a reputation to last longer and be more comfortable and flexible when hiking with my bike on bikepacking singletracks. Those sandals being the <strong>Shimano SD5</strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/2JbbOwZ">costing $120 on Amazon. </a></p>



<p>I just feel that these would be better for off the bike comfort as well as on the bike. For me both are as important as each other. And it is hard to find a shoe that works for both conditions. As one seems to be better in either circumstance. people have mentioned that these sandals are not as comfortable on the bike as the other sandals mentioned. But I feel I personally should be okay as I have toured with flip flops for 1000 of km&#8217;s and run ultra 50 km marathons in minimalist shoes, so my feet are adapted if you will to a minimal or less structural supporting shoe. </p>
