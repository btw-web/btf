<p>All these trailers are used by other bike tourers. In this article, we will be looking at these different highly recommended bike trailers for towing all your gear. They come in a range of prices and features. And some are better for different purposes, which we will discuss. So you will be able to find some great options for your next adventure.</p>



<p>We will be highlighting some important details and qualities of each trailer, and cover what other bike travellers like so much. What worked and what didn&#8217;t work so much. </p>



<p>First, lets cover the generalities of bike trailers and begin to understand what to look out for when buying one. So you can have a solid foundation before we start talking shop. </p>



<h2>Understanding Bike Trailers</h2>



<h3><strong>Bike Trailer Weight</strong></h3>



<p>Some say that bike trailers weigh more then a touring pannier setup. Yes, this maybe the case but how much heavier does a trailer setup weigh compared to panniers? </p>



<p>For example here is a comparison of the two setups:</p>



<p>Touring panniers setup : 2 x Ortlieb Back-Roller Classics (1900 grams), 2 x Sport Roller City &#8211; Front panniers (1210 grams), 3110 grams + Tubus racks front and back = 1280 grams. <strong>Total 4290 grams</strong> with a total capacity of around 65 L</p>



<p>Trailer setup : Freeparable T2 (one of the lightest trailer setups) = <strong>3600 grams </strong>with a 60 L max capacity and limited 30 kg weight capacity </p>



<p>This is just one example but you can actually get a lighter setup with a bike trailer setup. Not considering other handlebar bags and bike bags. As you could have these additionally for both setups. If you removed the front panniers, as I ride with only rear panniers for most my three or so month long tours this would make the panniers weigh less them the trailer at <strong>3080 grams</strong>. </p>



<p>So realistically even with one of the lighter bike trailer options in this list it still is heavier then a pannier setup. But I really don&#8217;t think a sub 1 kg difference is going to be that much on the hills. </p>



<h3><strong>Bike style and overall design</strong></h3>



<p>Bike trailers in general have a vary of design and style, even bike trailers built for touring and long distance cycling in mind they still vary from manufacturer. </p>



<p>In deciding which design is suited to you best. Is to ask yourself what is your main purpose for using the trailer? Are you taking your family on a bike tour and need a trailer for your kids? Hoping to shred some off-road trails? Or more of a year long touring expedition? or even taking you dog with you around the world by bike? You intended use will dictate the bike trailer that suits your need most. </p>



<p>For example, personally, I have been looking at getting a trailer. But I would most likely be using it for my English Staffy. I want to take him on a epic off-road bikepacking adventure. So a one wheel trailer with suspension would probably be the best option for me. </p>



<p><strong>Two or one wheel bike trailer</strong></p>



<p>Typically you want a trailer with two wheels for road tours and adventures you wish to go cycling with a toddler. Two wheel trailers offer, more stability at low speeds. And are more suited to around town and commuting. As they’re easier to load. </p>



<p>Then you have one wheeled trailers. Which are more my style and what I would prefer. These trailers are generally narrower, lighter, have a lower rolling resistance, are more manoeuvrable (as they lean with the bike), have one less wheel to puncture and can better avoid potholes.</p>



<p>But considering the wheels you also need to think about how the bike trailer will mount onto your bike. Depending on different models there are many different mounting systems. </p>



<h3><strong>Different mounting styles</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Axle Mount</strong></p>



<p>This is the most common mounting style with bike trailers. This mounting method id the quickest for installation and removal. A common size is a 12mm rear axle. Some of the bikes in this list are axle mounts. </p>



<p><strong>Seatpost Mount</strong></p>



<p>These are good for turning tight corners. They pivot closer to the front of the bike. The disadvantage is that the rear wheel cuts corners when you turn, making them not preferred for off-road touring or bikepacking. </p>



<h3>Foldable or packable bike trailers</h3>



<p>Again depending on your personal use for a bike trailer. Some trailer options out there offer you the ability to fold down the bike trailer. Making them perfect to travel on public transport with and flying oversees. You can also get packable folding bike trailers, for Bromptons and other folding bike brands. Allowing you to use the bike trailer as a trailer but also as luggage for all your gear and folding bike when it is time to fly back home. </p>



<h3>Pros To Using Bike Trailers</h3>



<ul><li>Some trailer options are able to disassemble, making them easier to get onto public transport. </li><li>You can just throw your stuff into a trailer instead of having to very carefully pack panniers.</li><li>Perfect for carrying a hiking bag when hiking and biking. </li><li>Add extra stability to the bikes control</li><li>Great option if you want to bike tour as a family, and take your toddlers with you. </li><li>Bike trailers eliminate the need for heavy-duty frames, forks and wheels. Permitting the use for just about any type of bike for touring. Meaning that you can use a lightweight bike, making you overall setup lighter then a traditional touring one. </li><li>If you are riding a bike that is not decide for cycle travelling over long distance. In terms of eyelets for racks and panniers. You do have the option to use a bike trailer to solve this problem. Or use bikepacking bags or <a href="http://cycletraveloverload.com/can-you-put-panniers-on-a-road-bike/">read about these ways to mounting racks on a bike that don&#8217;t accomodate them</a>. Many options out there. </li><li>Better for longer multiple month or even year long trips, allowing you to store more space. If you like to travel with a lot of gear! riding in comfort! bike trailer could be a option for you. </li><li>Great transport option if you want to take you pooch with you on a tour. Especially medium to large sized dogs, trailers are the best way to transport them.</li><li>Easier to cart around one bag off a trailer then all four panniers. </li><li>Single wheel trailer designs make it easier to carry large loads through difficult terrain </li><li>Large storage space allows for storing bulky items that you my want to take home on your trip. I was considering getting on to do a &#8220;Amazon FBA Book Sourcing Trip&#8221; where I go to thrift stores around Australia and fill up a cargo trailer to sell online.</li></ul>



<h3>Cons To Using Bike Trailers</h3>



<ul><li>It is harder with a trailer to have to carry your bike or bike through muddy areas. And hike a bike sections, also getting them onto trains and other public transport, can be a hassle</li><li>Perceived idea of a lack of secure storage</li><li>Effects on the overall handling of the bike</li><li>Possibility for extra tyres to puncture</li><li>Navigation through tight spaces that you would otherwise get though with panniers. A wider trailer may not. </li><li>Riding up hills can be a slog.</li><li>A trailer can mean extra hassle having to carry it, and having to fly with it overseas. All which is possible by the way, just takes extra hassle. </li><li>The better quality and reliable bike trailer option can be expensive and a added cost, compared to just using panniers. </li><li>More rolling resistance due to extra wheels And extra weight. Although you can get some lightweight trailers that do a great job </li><li>harder to lift over obstacles on trails etc. (single wheel trailers are easier more for two wheeled trailers) </li></ul>



<h2>Best Trailers For Your Next Adventure</h2>



<p>Now to the good stuff, what are some of the best bike trailers out there? When looking at bike trailers, remember that not all the trailers that you come across will be specifically designed for the demands and abuse from touring or bikepacking. </p>



<p>Some trailers that are cheaper may appear to look very similar to more expensive and durable models. But on closer inspection they are made from weaker materials and you can not expect them to last. </p>



<p>The great thing about the listed trailers in this article, is that all are used by fellow bike travellers. Most are designed for touring in mind. I say most as some options are cargo type trailers and baby trailers. That are not touring bikes first. But the fact that many bike travellers have used all them and have been impressed with how they hold up. Is enough of a confidence boost in these products for me!</p>



<p>The overall build quality of a bike trailer. Is something to look out for when you are looking at trailers. You don’t have to purchase any of the listed models below, but you for sure want to be careful when selecting a bike trailer, that is going to be able to stand up the the demands of bike touring. </p>



<p>Without further ado, check out these popular bike trailers for touring. They come from a variety of brands, so you will get a good selection of what’s available.</p>

<p>Perfect for hauling a heap of cargo around town. As this post is more suited to touring and bikepacking. Surly does offer a. short bed option, which is more appropriate to touring. Which is probably a better option. </p>



<p>The beds and hitch are constructed mainly of TIG-welded 4130 CroMoly steel. CroMoly steel is tough and durable and well-suited to this task. We used 304 stainless steel hardware where appropriate to ensure corrosion resistance and a long life. The beds have threaded eyelets for bolting down decking, corner posts, or creating other custom accessories using readily-accessible materials from your local hardware store, lumberyard or home improvement store.</p>
