<p>Wild camping is one of the most rewarding travel experiences one can have.</p>



<p><strong>What is wild camping?</strong></p>



<p>As there is no offical definition for “Wild Camping”, it does vary from person to person. For me and my idea of it is, a time when you setup your tent when you are NOT at a paid campsite or caravan park. Or arrange accommodation at someones home. This is a variety of potential wild camp spots you can choose from. Whether that is on private land, like a farm with the owners permission. In national parks amongst tall red woods. Listening to the waves as they crash against the shore on the most stunning of beaches. Or even a few metres of the road, if you have no other choice. It is important to note that wild camping is “illegal” in countries. But if one looks after the environment, I don’t see no harm in doing so.</p>

<p>I have wild camped many times before. If you don’t know my story I have now cycled across three countries in; USA, Japan and Australia. And for, I would say, around 80% of all nights I spent wild camping in the wilderness.</p>



<p><strong>Why Wild camp?</strong></p>



<p>One of the things that is great about wild camping, is it is <strong>FREE</strong>. Having to pay for accommodation every night on a bicycle tour does add up. One of the reason I choose and enjoy bicycle touring in general is the cost effective way it is to travel the world.</p>



<p>The <strong>AMAZING VIEWS</strong> and seclusion that one finds in these amazing locations. When you ride up steep hills for over an hour and unpack your bike. To then carry it up steeper stairs to finally witness the most amazing views. It is completely worth it!!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beachcamping-11.png?fit=720%2C405" alt="" class="wp-image-337" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beachcamping-11.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beachcamping-11.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beachcamping-11.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beachcamping-11.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p>The <strong>exciting unpredictability!!</strong> You never know where you will end up at the end of the night. Which excites me so much, I don’t plan to much where I am going to camp, it kind of happens. Although if you want those epic locations that might take a little planning.</p>



<p><strong>Why I don&#8217;t camp at caravan parks or motels most of the time?</strong></p>



<p>I understand one in a while a nice paid for accommodation with all the comforts is great and all. But there is more to the experience of bicycle travel then that. And wild camping is one experience that all bicycle tourers should try. Regular camping has a few contradictions. Noise is one thing that drives me nuts. Listening to noisy campers all night long can get frustrating. Then there is noisy car engines, smelly toilet blocks, loud generators. And the magic that is wild camping is missing.</p>



<p><strong>What equipment do I need? </strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="http://cycletraveloverload.com/bicycle-touring-gear-setup-what-to-pack-for-a-bicycle-tour/"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="679" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beachcamping-14.png?resize=720%2C679" alt="" class="wp-image-342" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beachcamping-14.png?w=764&amp;ssl=1 764w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/beachcamping-14.png?resize=300%2C283&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></figure>



<p>As far as equipment goes you only need what you all ready have with you, since you are bicycle touring. Tent, Sleeping bag, Sleeping mat, pillow, camp stove.

The only real addition to consider for this type of camping is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075WV7FBK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vegancodey-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B075WV7FBK&amp;linkId=7da0eff395c5a8fd26830545916d320b">Camping Shovel.</a> Something that is compact and lightweight.</p>



<p><strong>How to find wild camp spots?</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://bit.ly/2NXxE86">Wikicamps</a> is a great app that you can download for your phone, it costs $7.99. You can view any potential camp spots for free or paid any where in Australia. And they have different apps for other countries.</p>



<p><strong>Google Maps</strong> is a simple way to scout a potential camp for the night. I look on the satellite around my area and see if I can locate large patches of tree area. Or even do a simple google search for forest or national park around the area I am.</p>



<p>Ride along the road and see what you can find. Or even get the drone up and see where some camp spots are.</p>



<p><strong>Places to wild camp or camp for FREE on a bicycle tour?</strong></p>



<p>There are many places you can camp without having to pay a cent. Places from churches, footy ovals/recreation centres, some kind of tree or forest area in and out of towns. In Japan we camped anywhere from playgrounds, local parks, to right next to the airport.</p>

<p><strong>What makes the most epic wild camp spot?</strong></p>



<ul><li>Near a water source. But this is not essential you can pack enough food and water for a few nights camping in the middle of nowhere.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Finding flat ground to setup your tent. No bumps and laying on rocks and sticks.</li></ul>



<ul><li>DON’T pitch your tent up on a steep hill. Pitch with your head facing uphill. <strong>Don’t be like me and do this &gt;&gt;</strong></li></ul>

<p><strong>What makes the most epic wild camp spot? Continued&#8230;.. </strong></p>



<ul><li>Sheltered from windy conditions </li><li>The VIEW and scenery!! This is a high priority in most cases for the best wild camp spots. Views make it all worth the ride.</li><li></li></ul>



<p><strong>Things to consider when wild camping!</strong></p>



<ul><li>Setup camp later as it gets dark, you want to time it well so you can still see as you put up your tent and also not too early. As it is more visible. And consider packing up and leaving early. Both while dark to prevent being seen. Some times on tour you want to setup early and rest. When wild camping this can still be possible too.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Fires a generally a no go! Especially during bushfire season and it can also be a sign of help if on shore. A camping stove is advised. I use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S0DEAA/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vegancodey-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B000S0DEAA&amp;linkId=8ace6233ff9b5fa2933c5b08502914e0">Trangia</a> which is great as it is raised off the ground and the flame is protected. So it is very unlikely to start a fire with this stove.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Again make sure to leave no trace. Leave the environment as you found or better. Take all your litter with you. It should not look like a obvious campsite the next day.</li></ul>



<ul><li>ASK A LOCAL! If you are having troubles finding a wild camp spot, try having a chat with a friendly local. I don’t like asking people if I can camp in their backyard. But I will ask someone who starts talking to me. If they “know of any places around the area I can camp?” And sometimes they will offer a comfortable bed for me to sleep in. Or they might say “hey mate, I know a great spot anywhere along this stunning beach would be epic.”</li></ul>



<ul><li>Always trust your inner feelings. Be cautious and listen to your gut. If you roll up to a place and it feels off. Like the people who are around are giving you bad vibes. Move on and find some place else. Once you find a location you are happy with. You will have no worries and get a good nights sleep.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Have confidence and the right mindset. If you are too afraid to camp in the wild then it makes it hard to wild camp. This was me when I first started I was afraid. What if I get caught? What if someone robs me while I sleep? I am worried that the bush rangers would get me or even worse get murdered. That last one if from watching to many horror movies. Having this mindset can stop you from experiencing the joys of wild camping.</li></ul>
