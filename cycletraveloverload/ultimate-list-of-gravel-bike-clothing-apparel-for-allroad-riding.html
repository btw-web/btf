<p>Are you looking to get off the tarmac and hit the gravel and trails? Road cycling clothing might still technically do the job. But there is gravel specific clothing on the market. Such adventure apparel is designed for off-road riding with durable materials. </p>



<p>When it comes to <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-bikepacking-clothing-apparel/">clothing for bikepacking</a> I like to keep it cazh. Some gravel clothing is almost the same looking as road clothing for the efficiency and speed. But it seems the design is more comfortable for all-day riding.</p>



<p>Maybe you are looking to up your hipster style on the trail? Wanting something that is casual but has the function and on bike comfort of proper cycling clothing? These items have you covered and are pretty trendy, if style is most important! </p>



<h2>Gravel Jersey and Shirts</h2>



<p>Depending on your style and preference when gravel grinding. There are two different types of gravel tops and shirts. Being the more aero gravel jerseys, much like a normal cycling jersey. And then you have casual, often buttoned up, fun designed, short or long sleeve shirts. </p>
