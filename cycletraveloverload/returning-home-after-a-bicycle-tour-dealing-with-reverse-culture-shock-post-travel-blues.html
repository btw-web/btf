<p>Have you been on a long bicycle tour and when it is time to come home, you struggle to get back into the routine of normal life?</p>



<p>I want to share some advice for people who are almost at the point with returning home from a long bicycle tour. We will discuss all things you can expect when it’s time to return home.</p>



<p>When you are bicycle touring for months on end, you often get in the pattern of enjoying every single day. With fresh new experiences daily, it’s amazing. Let&#8217;s admit it, being home is not as interesting as being out there on the road. Your senses are not saturated in the present moment. And life experience is not as rich when you get home to what you already know. This type of change can often result in some kind of a ‘travellers depression’. </p>



<p>After getting back from being on the road for months. I feel like I am not being as productive in a way. As I’m not on my bike covering a daily distance or I’m not using my time to experience new things and really take a hold of what life has to offer.</p>



<p>This post adventure blues is a real thing that happens particularly amongst bicycle tourers. The way that I have discovered to combat these sensations after my travels. Is to try and establish routine back in each day. Trying to avoid just sitting on the couch. Maybe start planning for your next trip and start to get excited about that. And pick up a new skill or work on a new project. </p>



<p>For me personally, as I just got back from my trip up the east coast of Australia. And as I’m waiting for my next trip. I am learning how to build a blog (this blog that you are reading) which is keeping me proactive.</p>



<p>One thing to remember is don’t expect people to be necessarily interested in your stories of your adventure.</p>



<p>At times I feel I get disappointed when I talk to people who seem to lack the ambitions and have a consumerism outlook on life. &nbsp;I does frustrate me, when I have such meaningless conversations around these ideas. </p>



<p>If you’ve been on a couple of tours. You know how you get time to think about your life’s direction. These people who are stuck working away every day and don’t have time for themselves. They often don’t have these kind of thoughts that one can run into while cycling across the country. </p>



<p>I do think it’s super important to be grateful for the most simple things, like the modern day comforts, when you’re back at home. Such as; a comfy bed, warm shower, easy access to food supplies and shelter.</p>



<p>As time progresses you may find that your friends, family or even work colleagues may stop asking you about your trip and it may feel as though it’s never really happened. So I think it’s really important to document your memories so then you can reflect back on them and relive those moments. This is one of the main reasons why I love vlogging my adventures on YouTube. As I can go back to those videos and watch what I did on that day. You could even gather all the photos you took on your trip and place them into a nice book to display all the memories. </p>



<p>I did some googling and I ran into the term “reverse culture shock” and this pretty much seems to sum up this phenomenon.</p>



<p>Here is a definition: </p>



<p><strong><em>“Reverse culture shock</em></strong><em> is the emotional and psychological distress suffered by some people when they return home after a number of years overseas. This can result in unexpected difficulty in readjusting to the culture and values of the home country, now that the previously familiar has become unfamiliar.”</em></p>

And everything comes in waves. Quite literally!! have you seen this graph above! 🙂 You just have to allow some time to adapt to the changes.  credit &#8211; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www2.pacific.edu/sis/culture/pub/2.2.1-_returning_home.htm">www2.pacific.edu</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>When you experience this kind of travel blues. What is happening on the physical level? From bicycle travelling and then coming home.</p>



<p>It has something to do with the brain secrete serotonin. Those hormones that give you pleasure and enjoyment. When you’re riding day in day out for however many hours. Say 8 hours a day, you get a lot pumping through your body. Also being outdoors all the time you get a lot of sunlight. You will end up losing that boost when you get back home. Your body will crave the sensations without you really knowing. You just have to allow some time for your body to adapt to the new level of daily hormone secretion, that is generally a lot less when back home as you are not exercising as much. It is recommend to keep some kind of exercise habit everyday when you get back too. </p>



<p>Another way I discovered to help with the transition back home. To just keep sleeping in your tent outside, like in the backyard. Personally I prefer sleeping outdoors anyway. I just feel like I get a proper night&#8217;s sleep and you know being outdoors is great for the body.</p>



<p>It seems as though you change a lot when you go on a long tour and the people that you come home too, are often still the same. Understand that people may have the assumption that you are still the same as you were before you went on your trip, but in fact you have changed and this conflict can create some type of discomfort. </p>



<p>But all in all the main takeaway is to start planning for your next trip or even go on mini bike adventures. Just get back on your bike and just keep going. Have you ever experienced these kind of travel blues before? Share your experiences below in the comments. </p>
