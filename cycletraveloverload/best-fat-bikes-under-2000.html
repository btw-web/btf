<p>In this article are the best fat bikes money can buy under $2000 for your next bikepacking adventure. After doing some research for this article to see what other bloggers are writing about. There was nothing but crap fat bikes with the worst, cheap components. That is something you don&#8217;t want for a dedicated adventure fat bike. You need something that is reliable and going to get you across some epic snow capped trails, but also be great for commuting in the winter.  </p>



<p>I have tried my best to get some of the best in here. I have gone as far to include 2019 model bikes that have their new 2020 siblings which do cost more and have some upgrades and changes but you can pick them up for a few hundred dollars cheaper. Yes it might be outdated but these are still great bikes. And for under $2000 you can&#8217;t go wrong. </p>



<p>I am personally in the market for a fat bike, and have been doing some deep homework to find the best options around this $2000 budget range. And these bikes are what I found. So you know these are good bikes if I am considering them! Okay so in no particular order here are some of the best fat bikes under $2,000!</p>



<h2>Salsa 2019 Beargrease Carbon NX1 Eagle Fat Bike</h2>

<p>This is one example of last years model bike that has a updated and more expensive sibling. But still this bike can be picked up for <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FSalsa-2019-Beargrease-Carbon-NX1-Eagle-Fat-Bike">$1,999.00 at Tree Fort Bikes</a>. That is the thing with suggesting last year&#8217;s model bikes, they will soon become discontinued and harder to find new. And the new 2020 model sells from $2,499.00. The Beargrease is Salsa&#8217;s racing fat bike. This 2019 model has room to accommodate up to 4.6&#8243; tires on 100mm rims, and most 27.5 x 4&#8243; tires. </p>



<h2>Salsa Mukluk SX Eagle Fat Bike</h2>

<p>Another fat bike option from Salsa is the Mukluk. A Aluminum in combination with the Bearpaw carbon fork. The bike is made from a 6066-T6 aluminum frame which has better strength and fatigue characteristics than 6061- and 7000-series.

With 26 x 4.8 in. wheel and tire size delivers massive traction, stability and optimum flotation on soft surfaces such as ungroomed snow or loose sand. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F161755%2Fsalsa-mukluk-sx-eagle-fat-bike">Priced at $1,999.00 at REI.com</a></p>
