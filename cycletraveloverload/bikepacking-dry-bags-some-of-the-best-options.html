<p>I was in the market for some dry bags for my bikepacking setup. So I could use them for storing stuff and attaching them to my front fork cage. And also potentially getting one to mount to the handlebars as a handlebar bag with the help of a bikepacking harness. </p>



<p>I wrote a complete article about some of the best bikepacking handlebar harnesses, if you are interested in that go check it out. Then in a article about some of the best fork cage mounts, I touched on a couple dry bag options that you can use. But in this post I wanted to take that a step further and dive deeper into bikepacking dry bags and really see what the best options are out there. The great thing about dry bags as the name suggests is that they are waterproof. Which is a important factor when it comes to bikepacking and keeping your gear bone dry. </p>



<p>When I was looking for dry bags I was also concerned with the abrasion resistance of such bags. They are no doubt going to get abused and warn down from the demands of adventure cycling. So I asked bikepackers what dry bags they have been using and what they can recommend. There was some concerns with a couple bags, especially some of the Sea to Summit line. They make so many products and are great, but on of there cheaper bags didn&#8217;t hold up so well. But you can be sure that all these dry bags in this article are recommend by practitioners and people who actually use these products and can give you some confidence that they are going to stand up for your needs on the road. </p>



<p>Some seat bags are designed to have a harness with a dry bag attached at the rear. We are going to exclude this type of product from this article as. Most of these saddle bag harness/mounts are designed to fit very specific dry bags that are sold with the seat pack system. </p>



<p>I was considering Alpkit but they used to make very durable stuff years ago, but the current ones are thinner and definitely not as strong or abrasion resistant. </p>



<p>Especially when it comes to strapping these types of bags to a bike they are exposed to abrasion and the likes, so having highly durable bags is super important. </p>

<p>I did mention that S2S had some dry bags to look out for, as they didn&#8217;t hold up to wear and tare of bikepacking. But rest assured these <strong><a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F794758%2Fsea-to-summit-big-river-dry-bag-8-liters">Big River Bags</a></strong> are recommended by many of the bikepackers I asked, and they stand up to the heavy while bike traveling. You get so many options form colors and capacity. From 3L to 65L with many different capacities in between to suit your purpose for these dry bags. If you are after some for your cargo cages/fork cages then something like the 3L or 5L or even up to 8L would work well. They are priced from $24.95, $29.95 and $32.95 . These bags do feature hypalon attachment points to secure the sack to your cargo cage. Depending on how much space you ant you could run a 12L dry bag in your handlebar harness or even try for something bigger maybe get 15L or even 20L?</p>
