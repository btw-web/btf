<p>Winter is here or almost and you are looking for the best jacket to keep you warm and dry while you tough it out in the harsh conditions. With the technology of todays clothing technology we are so lucky that we can use these too out advantage to be able to get out a explore eve if the weather is not too shabby. </p>



<p>If you are into bikepacking and exploring by bike, which is what we are all about here at Cycle Travel Overload. There is a good article we wrote specifying some of the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-bikepacking-clothing-apparel/">best bikepacking clothing</a> and this is where we started to introduce some of the best winter cycling jacket options. Along with some mentioned in that article we are going to include even more that have been recommended by cyclists who commute, race or prefer to stop and smell the flowers as the travel across country or even around the world. </p>



<p>Along with this are you potentially looking for winter cycling shoes or boots too? If so <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-winter-cycling-shoes-boots-2020/">this article</a> should be some help to get you introduced to some of the options and weather or not winter style cycling shoes would be for you.</p>



<h3>What To Look For In A Winter Cycling Jacket?</h3>



<p>When you first look at a winter cycling jacket. You might want to confirm what style of riding you intend to do. Are you road racing and training? Or commuting to work? Or bikepacking up in the mountains? We are going to cover the best winter cycling jackets for all these different categories of riding. But you should personally figure out what style you like best. Do you want to look and feel like a pro racer in tight lycra? And get all the aerodynamic benefits from a tight fitting jacket? Or are you more like me and prefer to look for casual and chill so you can go into cafes and shops and stiff feel comfort with a more loose fit? This is something you need to figure out for yourself. I care very little about being aero when I am bikepacking around Australia. But having this said most of the jacket options for commuting or touring are lighter weight then some rather bulky options you can find out there. </p>



<p>With winter it brings rain! This means a jacket that is either waterproof (ideal) or water repellent is still a good option. Along with this it would be perfect if the material of the jacket dries quickly too. If it is going to rain full on and non-stop your best bet is a fully waterproof rain jacket. But if it is just on and off drizzle, then something like a soft-shell jacket with water repellent fabrics is okay too. Waterproof specific jackets are often bigger, heavier and bulker then a soft-shell. The lighter weight soft-shell jackets are good at shrugging off road spray or a short shower, but usually offer better fit, comfort and breathability. It is best if possible to get a jacket that does a good job repelling water but also provides great breathability as you don&#8217;t want your own sweat making you cold when it rains. </p>



<p>Windproof fabrics are a godsend! With winter conditions comes cold winds.  So you want to avoid very thin material jackets where the cold wind will go straight through the jacket. But you also don&#8217;t want a wind blocking material that stops the wind completely and does not allow for any breathability. Today though we are lucky as there are materials that exist which give us the best of both worlds; stopping cold air flow coming in and allowing our sweat or some of the hotter air to escape to stop from over heating and sweating too much. Also some well designed jackers offer heavier, less breathable fabrics on the front, and lighter, more breathable fabrics on the rear. </p>



<p>Choosing jackets with reflective details and are high visibility colors is something else that is important when selecting. As you want to be seen even if you have lights on your bike when riding at night or when it gets really overcast. Having this added visibility will be more safe while out on the road. Also this doesn&#8217;t mean you have to wear clothing that makes you look like a road worker. There are some really stylish jackets out there that offer high visibility colors that also look really cool. </p>

<p>This Showers Pass Elite 2.1 jacket by far takes the cake for one of the best winter cycling jackets on the market. It has been around for more then5 years and continues to deliver on great quality and value. Such a popular jacket that is has so many great reviews (<a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F132049%2Fshowers-pass-elite-21-cycling-jacket-mens%23product-reviews">don&#8217;t believe me? Read more here</a>)</p>



<p>This is a 3-layer waterproof, breathable shell with fully taped seams, that delivers maximum weather protection! Talk about breathability the jacket has 7 ventilation points to keep you cool! 2 pit vents, 2 cuff vents, single back vent and 2-way zipper. When it comes to reflect-ability you get a 3M reflective trim keeping you visible from all angles. A YKK AquaGuard Vislon water-resistant front zipper with stormflap. The jacket is almost designed like a proper road cycling jacket but you get that space for some movement. You do get a large back pocket and chest pocket with audio port provide plenty of storage space. During long rides you are kept comfortable with a soft moisture-wicking lining at collar. </p>



<p>Again the type of waterproofing is a 3-layer waterproof breathable laminate. The material is nylon and the jacket weighs in at 15.5 ounces or 439.5 grams. The jacket keeps is great at keeping you dry even in a down poor, and the vents are plenty large enough to allow ample breath-ability when the hills get steep and you are more active. One of the great things about this jacket is the high visibility. The red is nice but more so those reflective trims shine bright at night. The only thing to consider with this jacket is that it comes with the velcro for an optional hood without including the hood. This jacket is priced at <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F132049%2Fshowers-pass-elite-21-cycling-jacket-mens%23product-reviews">$269.00 from REI.com</a> This is the mens options if you are after the same but in the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F132144%2Fshowers-pass-elite-21-cycling-jacket-womens">womens model, that can be found here</a>. </p>

<p>Arc&#8217;teryx make some really great quality stuff. I am a big fan of this brand! They re like the idealistic outdoor brand. I have two of their jackets to share with you today. The Gamma is a breathable, articulated soft shell jacket with some stretch. It is ideal for alpine climbing and backcountry activities, like bikepacking! </p>



<p>Marketed as highly breathable and abrasion resistant. While also best used for mixed weather conditions, When the weather conditions are changing. Made from a breathable material, which allows moisture vapour to escape, helping regulate temperature and elevating comfort inside garment. The material is called Fortius 2.0. At the face of the jacket this means: 85% nylon, 15% elastane. And the backer: 94% polyester, 6% elastane. </p>



<p>Designed around a regular fit this means you get some freedom of movement with room for layers. It has a DWR (Durable Water Repellent) finish that acts at repelling moisture. This could quite probably be the best soft-shell jacket you can buy. It works perfect for any high output activity in the cold, as it will regulate your temperature over a much broader range of conditions. Great when temperatures are anywhere between -15c to +10, with light wool to heavy fleece underneath depending on activity and temperature. Like most soft-shell jackets it is not the warmest when stationary. It is not the best when it comes to everyday wear. However, the jacket is rather durable and made for tough conditions expected when bikepacking or adventure cycling. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F104540%2Farcteryx-gamma-mx-hoodie-mens">Price is 30% off at $243.93 over at REI.com</a></p>
