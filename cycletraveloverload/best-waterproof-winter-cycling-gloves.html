<p>Have you been on the endless search for the right gloves to keep your hands dry and warm while you cycle winter condition? Hopefully after reading this article your search will be over! </p>



<p>I have asked people from the bikepacking and bicycle touring community what winter and waterproof cycling gloves it is that they use and would recommend to a friend and these gloves below are the result. </p>



<p>We were going to include some more glove selections but they were only water resistant and not waterproof. This list is only waterproof gloves. But please keep aware that some of these gloves are not the best when it comes to keeping the extreme cold out. </p>



<h2>Endura Strike II</h2>

<p>These gloves feature a seam sealed, waterproof, breathable internal membrane. With Stetch, windproof outer fabric for flexbility and additional comfort. Fast-dry, insulating fleece inner. Silicon palm and finger prints for grip. Full Finger Terry sweat wipe and reflective prints. </p>



<p>These gloves are more expensive then some glove options but they do a good job at keeping your hands warm, block the wind, and keep water out. They are great except for one thing. They don&#8217;t work very well with touch screens like your phone. <a href="https://amzn.to/3bSdXcH">Priced at $49.99</a> </p>

<p>Shower Pass make some of the best quality cycling gloves on the market and these gloves I have to share with you are popular in the bicycle touring and bikepacking community for those winter cycling trips. If you don&#8217;t believe me you should read <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F134885%2Fshowers-pass-crosspoint-waterproof-knit-gloves">all the review at REI.com</a>. Known for how effectively waterproof they are. With a 3-layer, waterproof construction, they keep your hands dry while you&#8217;re biking in rainy conditions. The three layers consist of; a wear-resistant knit exterior, a waterproof/breathable Artex membrane and a CoolMax® moisture-wicking, antibacterial knit lining. Featuring a silicone print on the palm which increases grip. </p>



<p>What about sweat? Well the microporous waterproof membrane allows the gloves to ventilate in order to decrease sweat accumulation. Low-profile fit ensures excellent dexterity, so they don&#8217;t limit you just to using them on the bike, they can be used for other activities too and not feel bulky. </p>



<p>They are great for wind protection and no complaints about the waterproofing. They &#8220;feel&#8221; cooler than wool so it takes a bit longer for the hands to warm up. Very stretchy material. And also true to size. The thing these gloves lack is reinforcement in the areas of most contact when cycling. Also not sure how these work with touchscreens, as it was not mentioned on the sales page. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F134885%2Fshowers-pass-crosspoint-waterproof-knit-gloves">Priced at $45.00</a></p>



<h2>Showers Pass Crosspoint Soft-Shell WP Bike Gloves</h2>

<p>The women&#8217;s Showers Pass Crosspoint Soft-Shell WP gloves keep you focused on your ride. As you don&#8217;t need to worry if your hands will stay dry! Again these gloves feature a three layer design. The Artex™ 3-layer fabric provides waterproof, windproof and breathable performance. They do however say that these gloves have Touch-screen compatible index fingers and thumbs. </p>



<p>Furthermore, you get some other features like; Articulated finger flex and cushioned palm support provide comfort. Low-profile cuffs adjust with hook-and-loop tabs. Moisture-wicking lining. Handkerchief wipe on thumb and reflective logos and trim. Also you get a foam palm padding but probably needs more for cycling comfort. </p>



<p>These work well and keep you hands dry and somewhat warm. It is recommended to potentially get a size up as some have said that when the gloves freeze they shrink a little. Love the clip to keep them together so you can drap them over the handlebars after your ride. The gloves are warm however the liners are needed for under 35 degrees. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F161877%2Fshowers-pass-crosspoint-soft-shell-wp-bike-gloves-womens%23product-reviews">Priced at $58.93</a> (normally $85.00)</p>

<p>These GripGrab gloves are a similar style to the previously mentioned Showers Pass Knit Gloves. A knitted thermal glove that is also lightweight and features a waterproof membrane. These gloves are a versatile option for cool, damp autumn or spring day of cycling. The knitted fabric is lightly insulating to keep a chill off of the hands, while the membrane blocks cold wind and fends off light rain and sharp showers. The gripper print to the palm bolsters grip and bike control and subtle reflective sticker on your pinky finger catch the eye when you&#8217;re signalling a turn.</p>



<p>These gloves have been tested by cyclists with temperatures down to about 2C and their hands have stayed warm. Even when riding along the seafront with a chilly wind the cold doesn&#8217;t seem to penetrate. They aren&#8217;t too thick that you can&#8217;t feel the gear shifter either. Not turn certain on how these actually hold up with waterproofing. <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=12444&amp;awinaffid=604347&amp;clickref=&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiggle.com%2Fgripgrab-waterproof-knitted-thermal-glove%2F%3Fcurr%3DUSD%26dest%3D18%26prevDestCountryId%3D27">Priced at $56.50</a></p>

<p>Gore-Tex generally make great products and are well know for waterproof gear. these gloves unfortunately didn&#8217;t get the best feedback from customers. But are still worth looking into. These warm unisex gloves for cold weather conditions, feature Gore-Tex technology which makes them waterproof, windproof and extremely breathable. The gloves also include a terry cloth trim on thumb, Foam padding on palm, Moisture-absorbing material inside glove. Thermal interior, Synthetic leather on palm. They are stylish gloves, that fit well, and are good for temps down to maybe 30 degrees F or so, but not for colder. The main problem with these gloves is the warmth factor, a lot of customers expected them to have more warmth. <a href="https://amzn.to/2UJDCP8">Priced from $66.49</a></p>
