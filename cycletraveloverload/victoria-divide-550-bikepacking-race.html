<p>A bikepacking route traversing the Great&nbsp;<em>Dividing</em>&nbsp;Range across the state of&nbsp;<em>Victoria</em>. This years Vic Divide 550 was an amazing bikepacking experience. For me it was my first ever attempt at a bikepacking &#8216;race&#8217;. Although I had no desire to race it was however quiet incredible to socialise and meet with like minded bikepackers and share a really fun 5 days riding from the grand depart just out of Melbourne traveling all the way to Albury via Mt Buller. With some of the greatest Victorian high country sights, it made for an unforgettable bikepacking ride. </p>

<p>A big thanks to Lewis Ciddor for organising and putting together this route. It was definitely very challenging. I rode my Kona Sutra LTD gravel/adventure bike. However they do say that this is a mountain bike route. I did feel at times that my bike was not ideal. With some very steep sections, MTB single track, and very jarring down hill rocky sections. Made for some difficult times on the bike. The ideal bike for this route would be something like a MTB with suspension forks or a dual suspension mountain bike. I did even come of the bike at one stage leaving Buller. On a really sketchy, rocky downhill section. Attempting to avoid a rather large rock I then collected another and went over the handlebars. Hurting my hip and leg for the rest of the ride. Definitely needed wider tyres in my opinion. </p>

<p>You can <a href="https://victoriadivide550-2020.maprogress.com/?n=24">click here</a> for the finish route and rider results for 2020. And have a look at this years route as it was slightly changed from 2019. Also download the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/vd2020gpx">GPX file from 2020 here</a>. </p>

<p>The section from Jamieson to Mt Buller was the hardest section in general for most of the people who rode the route. As you start at 300 m elevation in Jamieson then you are riding the next 100km with up to almost 1300m elevation. That is demanding for one day of riding if you plan that. That being said a few of the riders for the 2020 attempt that I was talking to planned to ride it in under 48 hours. My plan was 5 days at a more adventure and leisurely pace. </p>

<p>Not only Buller there is a series of other climbs that are expected on this route too. Depending on how heavy your bike is and physical ability I would not recommend a gravel bike with limited gearing for this route.</p>

<p>As you can see on the above map there is a few huts to choose from. If you choose this route I definitely recommend you plan to stay at one. I unfortunately never got the chance. But want to ride some of this route again to experience a night at a hut. For further information about the hut, you can visit </p>

<p>Also the Victorian High Country Huts Assoc does a great job providing these wonderful huts on route. They make a great place to stop for a night or take shelter from the elements while out on the Vic Divide route. They are currently raising funds to rebuild all huts lost in this years fires. So if you want to help out you can make a donation of any kind or buy a patch or sticker <a href="https://hutsvictoria.org.au/shop/">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Food and Hydration</h2>



<p>This part I am about to mention about food could fall under preparation. But I feel that for some riders it can be a problem stomaching food regularly on a ride like this. So before setting off find some foods that are high in energy for performance that you can stomach and actually like eating. This should help you avoid not eating enough and then getting in a place where you are under malnourished and the negative thoughts start when you don&#8217;t have enough food in your system. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4425.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4720" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4425.jpg?w=5472&amp;ssl=1 5472w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4425.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4425.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4425.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4425.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4425.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4425.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Coffee to go!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Here are some of the foods I took with me that kept my energy up and about. During the entire ride, I was so surprised I never really had that feeling of being tired from not eating enough food. Some of these foods I prepared the night before the depart. My main goal with eating was to consume something at least every hour. Also carb-loading the night before with 1kg of pasta was helpful too. </p>



<ul><li>Baked potatoes</li><li>Fruits like Orange and Banana</li><li>Museli Bars</li><li>Electrolyte drinks</li><li>Peanut Butter Sandwichs</li></ul>



<p>If you pace for around 5 days, there is also places along the route where you can stop for a hot meal at the end of most days. Depending on how late you roll in. I was able to get to pubs at around 8pm to 8;30pm and just get a dinner in. </p>

<p>I also took about 3.5L to 4 L of water storage capabilities on my bike. You can fill up water in some re-supply locations along the route. However some of the towns like Jamieson you were not allowed to drink their water. As you get higher up and closer to Mt Buller the water from the river and streams is fine to drink. We got by using water purification tablets in the water.  </p>



<h2>Race Strategy &amp; Duration of Ride</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4423-1.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4721" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4423-1.jpg?w=5472&amp;ssl=1 5472w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4423-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4423-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4423-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4423-1.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4423-1.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4423-1.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This all comes down to your goals. Yes it is a race but I am not personally interested in beating the record. For me bikepacking is shared with others making new friends and having an amazing time socially. But also stopping and taking in the views and sights. I find when I am going hard on the bike. I get stuck in the moment of just focusing on pumping out the km&#8217;s. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I love pushing myself physically and seeing what I am truely capable of. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4362.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4723" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4362.jpg?w=5472&amp;ssl=1 5472w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4362.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4362.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4362.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4362.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4362.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4362.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>But for this years event at least my goal was 5 days, and I managed to do just that. It seems best to aim for around 5 days for this route. Doing it in this time will be perfect timing with resupply locations along the route and you will only be riding day time hours, mostly. This allows you to go at a slower pace where you can stop at times to take photos and smell the roses. Again if you plan to race then 48 hours to 3 maybe 4 days means you are going to make some sacrifices and not sleep as much. I can&#8217;t speak for this pace. But if this is your first bikepacking event like this 5 days is a good starting point. </p>



<h2>Preparation</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4418.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4722" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4418.jpg?w=5472&amp;ssl=1 5472w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4418.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4418.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4418.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4418.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4418.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_4418.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>When it comes to preparing physically for an event like this, a good start is just doing shorter versions over a couple of days along similar roads with a loaded bike. You should be comfortable with riding 100km with 2500-3000m of vertical. This will give you confidence coming into this route if you can do such rides. </p>



<h2>What Gear Should You Take?</h2>



<p>Put simply you want to take the most minimal setup you can that will still provide for you on the ride. The main pieces of gear I would recommend is.</p>



<ul><li>Shelter (tent/bivy/tarp)</li><li>Sleeping Bag &amp; maybe sleeping pad (I like to sleep comfortably)</li><li>Rain Jacket</li><li>Extra layers &amp; (on and off bike clothes if desired) I like to feel fresh off the bike while I sleep. </li><li>GPS Device (Phone or Bike Computer)</li></ul>

<p>Anything else is going to weigh you down probably too much for this demanding route. The more stuff you take the more effort will be required to cart it all. Also account for food packed on your bike too. I tried a different strategy this year and packed my bike full of food from the start and just ate it while riding. Stayed carbed up and didn&#8217;t have to stop for resupply as much or really worry about running out of food. I guess you could call it &#8220;bikepacking meal prep&#8221;. </p>



<p>As the route travels through Woiworung (Wurundjeri), Taungurung, Waveroo and Wiradjuri country. It’s especially important to acknowledge them as the traditional owners. </p>

<p>This route was somewhat a surprise to me and I must say I did underestimate the challenge of this route. When it comes to the elevation/trail condition ratio when it comes to effort required. I didn&#8217;t expect that much energy exertion. But looking back it am so happy and grateful that I got the chance to ride this route. Knowing when you finish that you road across the state of Victoria is pretty cool. And not just on the highway but the highland way!</p>
