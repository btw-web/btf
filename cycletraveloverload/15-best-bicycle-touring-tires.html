<p>What are the best tires for bicycle touring? Where do we start? There are so many options options out there. When looking for a set of tires for your next bike adventure. We first must cover a few things and figure out what it is you need to look out for in a tire for your bike touring rig. </p>



<p>What type of riding are you planning on undertaking? I have broken up this post into two different categories. Bikepacking tires and bike touring tires. Bikepacking tires are more suited as the name suggests to off-road style of riding and bike touring if suited to road riding with some versatility and durability to still be able to withstand minor gravel and dirt road conditions for a shorter amount of time. But in this article we are just going to cover bicycle touring tires. </p>



<p>So what should you look out for in a tire that you are hoping to stand up to the daily use a touring bike tire goes through? </p>



<p><strong>Tire rolling resistance</strong>. Some will debate that it is not at all that important for a touring bike. But it must be mentioned that the rolling resistance does have an effect on effort and efficiency. The lower the tires rolling resistance, decreases the required rolling effort, making you able to cover more K&#8217;s with the same amount of effort. </p>



<p><strong>Puncture resistance standards</strong>. How well has that given tire stand up to the potential for punctures. Maybe a option to start running a tubeless setup. </p>



<p><strong>Tread pattern</strong>. The style of a tires tread can have an effect on the rolling resistance and overall wear and tear of the tire over time. And it also depends on the type of terrain you are riding on to the style of the tires tread. Meaning that if you want to ride road most of the days on your adventure, you may want to look at a tire that offers minimal tread to increase speed. </p>



<p>I asked many bike tourers and bikepackers what are their personal favourite tires for their adventures. They are a favourite as they have stood the test of time and the general abuse of a bike adventure. So lets talk about your options. </p>



<h3>Schwalbe Marathon Plus</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="493" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/download-2.png?resize=720%2C493" alt="" class="wp-image-2099" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/download-2.png?w=728&amp;ssl=1 728w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/download-2.png?resize=300%2C205&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/download-2.png?resize=50%2C34&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Recommended by most bike tourers these tires are a top pick if you plan to ride across countries and expect your tires to hold up and &#8220;perform consistently for thousands of kilometres.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Marathon plus wire bead designed tire features a five millimetres thick puncture protection belt. The Smart Guard is designed to resist, thumbtacks, glass, and other sharp-edged debris. The tires design offers a lighter roll for a smooth and comfortable ride. </p>



<p>Due to the added protection to the Marathon Plus, the weight of the tire is slightly heavier compared to some other touring bike tires. Ranging from, 595g for 25c and up to 960g for 38c. </p>



<p>People have ridden in 117 degree temperatures with around 65-70 pounds of stuff on their bikes. And these tires have had, no flats and no problems. The Marathon plus cost <strong>$46.90 each</strong></p>



<h3>Continental Travel Contact</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="493" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/download-1-2.png?resize=720%2C493" alt="" class="wp-image-2100" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/download-1-2.png?w=728&amp;ssl=1 728w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/download-1-2.png?resize=300%2C205&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/download-1-2.png?resize=50%2C34&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>A trekking tyre also named as &#8220;The Globetrotter&#8221;. If another tire option up there with the Marathon Plus. It is designed to have a robust carcass, ability to carry heavy loads, protection against chafing and cuts, effective puncture resistance and finally the tread design makes it possible to explore paths around the world quickly and safely.</p>



<p>The tire has relatively low rolling resistance, even when the tire is running at a lower psi. Good durability and good resistance to punctures that you may encounter on the road. Not only excellent paved road traction, but it also offer great traction for dirt. One of the cool options to the Travel Contact is the availability in a super wide 700&#215;50 option. The price point for these tires is value at<strong> $34.65 each</strong></p>



<h3>Schwalbe Marathon Almotion</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1084" height="950" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61PFoKO5xL._SL1111_.jpg?fit=720%2C631" alt="" class="wp-image-2101" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61PFoKO5xL._SL1111_.jpg?w=1084&amp;ssl=1 1084w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61PFoKO5xL._SL1111_.jpg?resize=300%2C263&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61PFoKO5xL._SL1111_.jpg?resize=768%2C673&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61PFoKO5xL._SL1111_.jpg?resize=1024%2C898&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61PFoKO5xL._SL1111_.jpg?resize=50%2C44&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p>These Almotion tires are tubeless ready with a guarantee of the lowest rolling resistance, while maintaining a very high puncture resistance .he main selling point about these tires is there rolling resistance. They outperform many tires when put to the <a href="https://www.bicyclerollingresistance.com/tour-reviews/schwalbe-marathon-almotion-2016">test</a>. </p>



<p>These tires seem to perform really well in wet weather conditions, especially with how much these tires are able to disperse. At first glance these tires don&#8217;t appear to have much off a tread pattern or grooves to result in a large amount of water dispersement. You may want to look into getting fenders for your bike they are that good. A bit more on the expensive side these tires cost around <strong>$70 each</strong></p>



<h3>VITTORIA RANDONNEUR CROSS TOURING</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="900" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61pg3Os9xUL._SL1000_.jpg?resize=720%2C900" alt="" class="wp-image-2103" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61pg3Os9xUL._SL1000_.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61pg3Os9xUL._SL1000_.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61pg3Os9xUL._SL1000_.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61pg3Os9xUL._SL1000_.jpg?resize=40%2C50&amp;ssl=1 40w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>When compared to the Marathon Plus it comes in at around 400 grams lighter for the same sized wheel. These tires look and feel great with a well made tire with a thick enough build. The Vittorias Cross tires are pretty stiff and not too easy to mount, but with some patience you will get there. </p>



<p>Durable against thorns and&nbsp;other junk on the roads. The tread pattern is directional so you need o make sure the are facing the correct direction. They hold up well and are great for dry trail, asphalt, even wet roads. They cost <strong>$33.99 each</strong></p>



<h3>VITTORIA&nbsp;RANDONNEUR II&nbsp;</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/513nbc9rwLL.jpg?resize=500%2C500" alt="" class="wp-image-2104" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/513nbc9rwLL.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/513nbc9rwLL.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/513nbc9rwLL.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/513nbc9rwLL.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Again it seems these tires are a little harder to install them most. The beat seems very tight and may snakebite your rim. But once they are one they are great. They are smooth rolling with great puncture resistance. Allowing you to ride over rocks, sticks, broken glass, without concern. Very good grip in wet weather, too. This tire is more rigid and the tire pattern is more on the slick side. The tread is beefy, and &#8220;should have no problem getting 2,000 loaded miles out of these &#8221; The cost is realtively cheaper at around <strong>$27.00 each</strong></p>



<h3>CLEMENT X’PLORE MSO</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1258" height="950" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/81BDeOpE9IL._SL1500_.jpg?fit=720%2C544" alt="" class="wp-image-2105" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/81BDeOpE9IL._SL1500_.jpg?w=1258&amp;ssl=1 1258w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/81BDeOpE9IL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=300%2C227&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/81BDeOpE9IL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C580&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/81BDeOpE9IL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=1024%2C773&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/81BDeOpE9IL._SL1500_.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Clement is a tire option that is better suited for many riding conditions, not just road, so if you love touring off the beaten track, these could be a good options for you. The smooth rolling centre tread increases your speed and grip. They also have fairly aggressive shoulder lugs which assist in increased traction and cornering performance. Furthermore it has a 120 TPI casing, which lends itself to comfy, low pressures. <strong>Starting at $57.98</strong></p>



<h3>SCHWALBE MARATHON&nbsp;WINTER</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1059" height="950" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71zdRhxC79L._SL1500_.jpg?fit=720%2C646" alt="" class="wp-image-2106" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71zdRhxC79L._SL1500_.jpg?w=1059&amp;ssl=1 1059w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71zdRhxC79L._SL1500_.jpg?resize=300%2C269&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71zdRhxC79L._SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C689&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71zdRhxC79L._SL1500_.jpg?resize=1024%2C919&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71zdRhxC79L._SL1500_.jpg?resize=50%2C45&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>These Marathon Winter tires are very unique in that they have spikes running down the centre tread of the tire, best suited for riding on ice at minimal pressure. Against these are best suited for when riding on snow or icy environments, but they are okay to ride normally at about 80 PSI you almost don&#8217;t notice the spikes, but be carful on corners. When riding on pavement, &#8220;there is a noise from the studs that sounds like sizzling bacon, and there is definitely a noticeable increase in rolling resistance&#8221; </p>



<p>But if you plan to go touring in the middle of winter and have to put up with icy conditions these are a tire to look further into, <strong>priced at $73.60 each</strong></p>



<h3>Schwalbe Big Apple, 29&#215;2.35</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1094" height="950" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61m3XA64zaL._SL1500_-1.jpg?fit=720%2C625" alt="" class="wp-image-2108" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61m3XA64zaL._SL1500_-1.jpg?w=1094&amp;ssl=1 1094w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61m3XA64zaL._SL1500_-1.jpg?resize=300%2C260&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61m3XA64zaL._SL1500_-1.jpg?resize=768%2C667&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61m3XA64zaL._SL1500_-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C889&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61m3XA64zaL._SL1500_-1.jpg?resize=50%2C43&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>I have been personally looking into getting these tires for the next long distance road tour I will be going on (maybe finish of my Australia Tour with them). Fatty tires make a bike look so nice, but also provide some extra comfort. They have also been know to work with some fat bike wheel sets. They are a well built set of tires that have a little spring in the sidewalls to reduce the mushy feeling when cornering. This tire absorbs very well and the tire wall seems thick and resilient. Price for the Big Apple is <strong>$42.89 each</strong></p>



<h3>Marathon Mondials</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="623" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61RV3qhhJPL._AC_SL1300_.jpg?resize=720%2C623" alt="" class="wp-image-2119" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61RV3qhhJPL._AC_SL1300_.jpg?w=965&amp;ssl=1 965w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61RV3qhhJPL._AC_SL1300_.jpg?resize=300%2C260&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61RV3qhhJPL._AC_SL1300_.jpg?resize=768%2C665&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61RV3qhhJPL._AC_SL1300_.jpg?resize=50%2C43&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>These Mondial tires are fast and light while still offering some depth to the tires thread lugs, to provide sufficient grip. The pretty round cross section on these tires means that they corner fairly well. Someone who has been touring for over 45 years and tried many different tires. They say they &#8220;are absolutely the best touring tire available. &#8230;and they are foldable.&#8221; The Mondials would probably not be the best option for off-road gravel riding. <strong>Price $55.26 </strong> </p>



<h3>Marathon Supreme</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="475" height="1092" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61yY4uQ7IpL._AC_SL1111_.jpg?fit=445%2C1024" alt="" class="wp-image-2123" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61yY4uQ7IpL._AC_SL1111_.jpg?w=475&amp;ssl=1 475w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61yY4uQ7IpL._AC_SL1111_.jpg?resize=130%2C300&amp;ssl=1 130w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61yY4uQ7IpL._AC_SL1111_.jpg?resize=445%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 445w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61yY4uQ7IpL._AC_SL1111_.jpg?resize=22%2C50&amp;ssl=1 22w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Supremes offer very good grip wet or dry, due to the One Star triple compound based on special Polymers, which also provides more cut-resistants. They are fast at a advertised 440 grams. For a tire with puncture protection the rolling resistance is very low while also feeling cushy. Users have reported taking these tires off-road and on gravel, and they seem to hold up fine. These tyres are FAT with ETRTO 622-37 making them seem more like 37 mm compared to 25 mm. When fully loaded for a tour they are able to be at a lower pressure while still the fat of the tire offers grip and excellent stability/security. Another great thing about these tires is the reflective side-walls, increasing visibility at night. The only downside is the price <strong>From $69.98 </strong>each they are not the cheapest, but you get what you pay for. And these are highly recommended. </p>

<p>The Michelin Protek is the dedicated multi-purpose tire for asphalt and track. The tread pattern makes for easier rolling while the rubber compound gives excellent grip. The continuous design at the center and the high number of grooves at the shoulders give excellent grip on wet and greasy surfaces. The 1mm thick anti-puncture reinforcement provides effective protection for everyday use. Progressive grooving rate with more grooves at the shoulders for excellent grip. Rolling continuity at the center for greater efficiency on the road or track.</p>



<h3><em>Rene Herse tire</em>s &#8211; Rat Trap Pass</h3>

<p>A more expensive option the Rap Trap Pass tires come in a 54 mm width providing much plush, designed for all-road riding. They are a great touring bike option. Rene Herse names their tires after passes, the &#8220;Rat Trap Pass bridges the gap between the mighty Suiattle and White Chuck Rivers. It’s a road that is rough in places and smooth in others.&#8221; The extra volume of the wider tire increases your confidence and speed. On pavement, the grip of the Rat Trap Pass is incredible – think race car with ultra-wide tires. <strong>Price From $71.00 each</strong></p>



<h3>Marathon Racers, 26 x 1.5&#8243;</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1043" height="950" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61WeP0dCaxL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?fit=720%2C656" alt="" class="wp-image-2126" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61WeP0dCaxL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?w=1043&amp;ssl=1 1043w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61WeP0dCaxL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=300%2C273&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61WeP0dCaxL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C700&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61WeP0dCaxL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=1024%2C933&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61WeP0dCaxL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=50%2C46&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>These Racers are fast and gripping enough for some aggressive riding. They are also secure, you will not be disappointed! A very good price compared to some tire options that claim puncture resistance. It seems that most bike tourers will opt for these cheaper wire bead versions of the Marathon Racer. If you want a touring specific relatively lightweight bicycle tire, you are not making a bad a choice to choose the Marathon Racer. <strong>$38.86 each</strong></p>



<h3>CONTINENTAL TOURING PLUS</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="483" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61fVM4Um9HL._AC_SL1024_.jpg?resize=720%2C483" alt="" class="wp-image-2128" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61fVM4Um9HL._AC_SL1024_.jpg?w=992&amp;ssl=1 992w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61fVM4Um9HL._AC_SL1024_.jpg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61fVM4Um9HL._AC_SL1024_.jpg?resize=768%2C516&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61fVM4Um9HL._AC_SL1024_.jpg?resize=50%2C34&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Touring Plus has a fairly good puncture protection design. Highly elastic, specialty rubber between the tread and the casing make the Plus Protection nearly impenetrable, fending off all types of foreign objects- even a tack can’t get through. This tire features a balanced silica tread pattern, keeping your bike rolling effortlessly down roads and paths. Due to the tires being so stiff, they don&#8217;t provide the most smoothest ride on rough road surfaces. <strong>Price $45.00 each</strong></p>



<h3>Marathon Range Cruiser </h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1034" height="950" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61txsQd1e2L._AC_SL1111_.jpg?fit=720%2C662" alt="" class="wp-image-2127" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61txsQd1e2L._AC_SL1111_.jpg?w=1034&amp;ssl=1 1034w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61txsQd1e2L._AC_SL1111_.jpg?resize=300%2C276&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61txsQd1e2L._AC_SL1111_.jpg?resize=768%2C706&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61txsQd1e2L._AC_SL1111_.jpg?resize=1024%2C941&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61txsQd1e2L._AC_SL1111_.jpg?resize=50%2C46&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>I had a set of the Marathon Rang Cruisers on my Surly LHT which they seemed to last for around a few thousand kilometres of multiple terrain bike touring. Mostly on road but they also held up well on off-road gravel conditions. They are very cheap at <strong>$20.29 each</strong>, not the best touring bike tire option, I had to get a new set for the back, half way through my Australia tour. </p>
