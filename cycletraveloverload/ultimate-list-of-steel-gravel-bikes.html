<p>Steel is a dream material for adventure and gravel bikes. Yes it can be a heavier material when compared to aluminium and titanium. But for this article we are focusing strictly on gravel bikes that are made of steel. There are some bikes that are in the grey area of being gravel bikes and adventure or touring bikes. Like the Kona Sutra LTD for example. For these other bikes we have left them out and these bikes listed below are all road gravel riding machines made form steel. If you are after <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/15-best-monstercross-bikes-650b-gravel-bikes-in-2020/">Monstercross bikes or 650b gravel bikes</a> this article might be helpful. Also read more about; some of the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/top-8-drop-bar-mountain-bikes/">best Drop Bar Mountain bikes here</a>. If Titanium is more your style, here are some of the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/11-best-titanium-gravel-bikes-2020/">best Ti Gravel bikes.</a> </p>



<p>Here at Cycle Travel Overload we are all about that! Traveling by bike! And all these gravel bikes are more then capable to hold up to your demands for bikepacking adventures on and off-road. </p>



<h2>Why Ride Steel?</h2>



<p>Personally I have a thing for steel bikes and apart from having so much fun putting this article together. I have found there to be some really great benefits to opting for a steel built bike!</p>



<p>You would think that high-tech frame materials like carbon, aluminum and titanium are taking the cycling scene by storm these days. But I am happy that steel is still being used by adventure bike manufacturers and they still see the important of the &#8216;old school&#8217; material. When I first got into exploring by bike, I was touring and touring bikes are mostly made from steel. Due to the demands of generally carrying heavy loads and hauling all your gear. You need a bike that has the <strong>strength</strong> for many days in the saddle. </p>



<p>Some of the better steel used for bike frames are more fatigue resistant and stiffer for a given volume than titanium or aluminium. Which is why you may see some of the well built steel bikes with slender tubing. Not all steel frame bikes are built with really skinning tubing but for bikes like Surly the slender design helps provide more in valuable space along the chainstay between the tyre and cranks.</p>



<p>Along with strength, steel bikes offer <strong>toughness or durability.</strong> Making them built for adventure riding. You can scratch up, dint, and bend steel frames but still ride the bike for years and years. As this material is less effected by the abuse expected when you are out there on the trails. Also steel fails relatively slowly, giving you chance to fix a crack or a bend before it becomes dangerous. </p>



<p><strong>Weight</strong> was a downside for steel bikes for awhile. But I believe it is a thing of the past. For example I own the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/kona-sutra-ltd-review-bikepacking-bike/">Kona Sutra LTD 2020</a> and when i was shopping around and picked this thing up at the bike shop. I was so surprised with how light it was. Now steel is not going to be a lightweight as carbon or potentially Titanium and Aluminum. But it is up there with these materials, now days! Most of the more modern steel gravel bikes are around that 10kg (22 pounds) to 13 kg (28.5 pounds) range. Thanks to the likes of thinner tubing. Also some of the bikes in this list have a carbon fork combo with steel frame which makes the overall weight lighter. Also with modern high-end, high-tech steel the wall thickness can be as thin as a can of coke. </p>



<p>Furthermore on weight a steel bike probably weighs about 2-3 kg more than the equivalent carbon bike. And we are all about adventure riding more so then racing. But if you are into bikepacking races and all that. Steel still provides as a viable option. With all the added accessories to your bike like pedals, body weight, other gadgets, bikepacking bags and gear. That little extra weight really would not matter too much. And certainly doesn&#8217;t matter to me as someone who is just out there to explore. </p>



<p>Then you have <strong>ride quality!</strong> Many people who love steel will talk to you non-stop about how well it handles, even myself if you get me started! Steel rides with stiffness, comfort and liveliness. From experience with my 2020 model gravel/adventure bike, it glides over the really rough stuff like floating on clouds! Yes along with the suppleness of gravel tires. Combined with a steel frame. That is strong and flexible, you experience comfort and it is rather easy on your joints. Steel dampens vibration better than aluminum and doesn’t transmit as much shock through the frame to the rider, creating a smoother ride feel.</p>

<p>The Satyr was a mythical forest creature known to the Romans as a woodland God. The Satyr is the wild side of your drop bar stable, just begging you to turn every ride into a party. Egging you on &#8211; “slide into that corner,” “jump those roots,” “send it down that chute.” Is it a gravel bike? You could call it that. We just call it a bike for fun (and glory). <a href="https://ritte.cc/products/the-satyr">Read more</a></p>
