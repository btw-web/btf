<p>If you’re spending a long time on your bike you want it to be as comfortable as possible. We all know that fatter tyres can absorb a lot of vibrations but we often overlook the seatpost when thinking about comfort. Can it really make that much difference?</p>



<p>The basic geometry of a bicycle frame means that the exposed seatpost is in the prime position to absorb abnormal forces. Depending on how much luggage you’re carrying, the seatpost design can have a big impact on your comfort. Spending hours on varying terrain absorbing road buzz and larger bumps can have big impacts on fatigue and pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So we know they can make a difference but which one is the right one? Let’s explore them and their differences.</p>



<p><strong>What are seatposts made of?</strong></p>



<p>Let’s start with the basics, most standard seatposts are made from aluminium. It’s fairly lightweight and cheap but it isn’t the most flexible. They are usually straight and rigid. Higher end seatposts are now made from carbon, it’s lighter, absorbs more vibrations and offers more flexibility but this comes with a higher price tag. Then there are a few bikes that use titanium, but this is mainly to look pretty and we won’t focus on them.</p>



<p>Brands are developing more and more variations to their seatposts meaning you will have to choose one that fits with you and your bike. For example, certain carbon seat posts tend to work best when more of the post is exposed, allowing for more vertical flex, thus favouring taller riders. High end road bikes may have smaller diameter or aero shaped seat posts for less air resistance and this will also limit your choices.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Understanding Seatpost Design</strong></p>



<p>In general, there are three common sizes of seatpost. Standard is considered 27.2mm and 30.9mm, then oversized sits at 31.6mm. Within those sizes you can get three common designs.</p>



<ul><li>Straight&nbsp;</li><li>Suspension&nbsp;</li><li>Flex&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Technical Mountain Bikers are also using a fourth option:</p>



<ul><li>Dropper&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Straight seatposts are just as their name suggests, straight, and therefore generally worse at dampening road buzz than the other two designs. This means more of the vibrations come straight up the post and end up travelling through your body, leading to increased fatigue after a few hours.</p>



<p>Suspension seatposts are less common these days but are better at absorbing those big bumps. These posts can be favoured by heavier riders or those with rigid MTBs. However, due to their engineering they tend to be bulkier and heavier and can be outdone by suspension. If you are looking for some suspension seatpost choices, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-suspension-seatposts-for-comfort/">here</a> are some of the most comfortable available. </p>



<p>Flex seatposts do not have added springs but their design absorbs the abnormal forces. Generally made out of carbon fiber aligned in such a way that gives vertical flexibility when absorbing force.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dropper seatpost is popular with technical mountain bikers, it allows you to completely drop your seat out of the way at the flick of a switch to enable more control over your back wheel during downhills. Then when you need the power you can flick it back up to the normal height.</p>



<p><strong>Smoother Riding With Slimmer Tyres</strong></p>



<p>So we all know that fatter tyres and decent suspension will absorb most of the bumps, and if you’re in that category then you can probably get away with a standard straight aluminium seat post. However, if you tend to ride with slimmer tyres and a rigid frame then a flex or suspension post is where you should be looking. This means you can ride on thinner tyres, carry less weight but still have higher comfort levels. The higher end models have outshone the suspension seatposts in trials.</p>



<p><strong>Bike Geometry</strong></p>



<p>Whichever bike seatpost you are choosing, it has to work best for your fit. Seatposts can come in a straight, setback or layback designs. They can also perform better being more or less exposed. In general, all seatposts perform better the more exposed they are. If you’re a smaller rider then you need to think about the benefit you’d get from investing in a fancy carbon seatpost but then not being able to expose it as it was designed. There are some carbon seatposts that perform better than others when they are less exposed and your bike fitter should be able to advise. Likewise there are some seatposts that are designed to perform best for lighter riders and some for heavier riders and this should also be taken into account when choosing.</p>



<p>Setback and layback are slightly different. Most straight seat posts will have some degree of setback. This is where the position of the clamp puts you further behind your crankset and changes the angle between your knee and pedal and your hip mobility.</p>



<p>Layback posts will be visibly bent and push the clamp even further behind the midline of the post. Your bike fitter will work out your geometry to determine how far behind midline you need to be, if at all.</p>



<p><strong>I’m bikepacking or touring, do I need to bother with an expensive seatpost?</strong></p>



<p>Good question. Bikepacking saddlebags and rear panniers will absorb a lot of the vibrations. You might be on a bike that has slightly fatter tyres which will also absorb a lot of unwanted road noise or bumps. So if you’re travelling with a lot of gear you might be just fine with a regular straight aluminium seatpost. However, if you’re travelling lighter or on harder surfaces then you might just find that extra bit of comfort through investing in a seatpost upgrade.</p>



<p><strong>Cost of a new seatpost.</strong></p>



<p>As with all bike mods there is a huge range in price. Firstly you need to think about what we have outlined above and compare that with your budget. If you don’t want to spend a lot then cheaper options tend to be aluminium and can cost as little as $60 but you likely already have this option on your bike and a flexibility upgrade would be to get a thinner post with a shim. Moving up to carbon options, you can pick up a basic model for around $140 or the fanciest ones can cost you north or $300! If you’re looking at suspension models then the most well rated one on the market sits at around $260.</p>



<p><strong>Go to a bike fitter</strong></p>



<p>So, if you’re travelling light and are struggling with your positioning or excessive vibrations then looking into a new seatpost could well be the answer you’ve been looking for. Make sure you get a bike fitter to have a proper look with you on the bike before you go radically changing your seat positioning and potentially doing more damage than good!</p>
