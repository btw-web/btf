<p>There are so many front rack options out there to choose from for your bicycle touring or bikepacking setup. Before we go any further, some people believe that bikepackings has no racks but I would argue to differ. There are bikepacking panniers designs by bike brands that serve this purpose. Furthermore there actually are some racks front and rear that are better suited for bikepacking setups. </p>



<p>In this article we will cover some of the more popular bikepacking front racks and take a look at some front racks that are recommended also for bike touring. </p>



<p>When looking for a front rack for your bike there are a few things to consider before going out and getting a rack system. Firstly it comes down to your intended use for a front rack. Are you going to be using it for touring and putting big, bulky front panniers on? Or are you looking for a flat platform rack that can hold the likes of a Rando bag or heavier handlebar bag, to add to your bikepacking setup? All the racks below kind of fit in these two main uses. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://mailchi.mp/e3df8925e281/freebook"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="95" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Sound-2-4.png?resize=720%2C95&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5720" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Sound-2-4.png?w=760&amp;ssl=1 760w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Sound-2-4.png?resize=300%2C39&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Sound-2-4.png?resize=50%2C7&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></figure></div>



<p>Once you have a general idea how you wish to use your new front rack, then you want to see how well they hold up. The strength of a rack is rather important. To figure out the capabilities of a rack, I have included the fine details for all the racks listed below. But you want to look at the load capacity, most should be fine to carry what you need, but if you are carry heavier gear. There are some reliable racks in this list like Surly for example that are built to stand very heavy loads and stand up to the abuse of bike adventuring. The built materials is something else to consider you generally want a rack made from Steel to provide the best strength. But these will generally be heavier. </p>



<p>This is where it can get a little tricky, if you are looking for the lightest rack that does not mean it is necessarily the strongest. </p>



<p>You also want to figure out your bikes ability to accomodate a front rack. Does it have the necessary eyelets for mounting racks? Most racks fit a large range of bikes. If your bike is a touring bike or a bike built with bikepacking in mind, like some gravel bikes, and adventure bikes, then you should be fine for mounting racks. If you are wanting to add a front rack to your bike that does not have the appropriate mounting points for a rack then I would suggest to give this <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/can-you-put-panniers-on-a-road-bike/">article a quick read.</a> This post shares a couple ways you can mount racks on your bike if they don&#8217;t have eyelets. It is not the best resource I must be honest. That is why I have in the works another article that will go into detail about how to mount a bike rack without eyelets, so watch this space. </p>



<p>If you are bikepacking and looking for a front rack. Did you know that you can get around having a front rack setup all together? Now if you are wanting to install a Rando bag then you will still need a rack for support. But you can install some <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-bikepacking-cargo-cages-dry-bags-bikepacking-fork-cages/">cargo cages with dry bags</a> that does a good enough job for replacing a front rack and micro-pannier setup. These bikepacking fork cages are generally a lighter weight alternative. But you are slightly limited in the capacity when compared to panniers. And you bikes fork does require some eyelets to mount these cages.</p>

<p>But if you are still interested to look into some of the better front rack options out there. Here they are! I asked many bike adventurers what front racks they personally use and could recommend to someone like you who is interested in getting a front rack and this is what they suggested. In no particular order, and some can be used for bikepacking and touring. </p>

<h2>Old Man Mountain Sherpa</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="350" height="477" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/c8f349e8e1d8f10863958d9936a73cf6.jpg?resize=350%2C477&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4436" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/c8f349e8e1d8f10863958d9936a73cf6.jpg?w=350&amp;ssl=1 350w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/c8f349e8e1d8f10863958d9936a73cf6.jpg?resize=220%2C300&amp;ssl=1 220w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/c8f349e8e1d8f10863958d9936a73cf6.jpg?resize=37%2C50&amp;ssl=1 37w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>These front racks I would categorise as best used for touring. They are built rather tough and are able to carry up to 19 kg of load. These have a top plate design which means mounting of panniers higher up then say a low rider rack. This is debatable but some would say that running your load up higher results in a more difficult handling then running your panniers lower to the ground. But there is no real evidence to support this. This front rack is rather universal fitting, 26&#8243; wheels, 27.5&#8243; and 29&#8243; wheels and bikes with Fox or a Rockshox forks. They don&#8217;t require eyelets for mountings, instead use a clamping system around the fork, the OMM clamps and a thru axle design. A minimalistic design that weighs 635 grams and it is ready to carry your panniers wether you have a front suspension, QR15 axle, v-brakes or disc brakes. They would also make a great front rack for a front suspension bikepacking rig. Priced from <strong>159.95 Euros</strong> or around $180 USD</p>



<h2>Tubus Duo</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="525" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tubus-Front-Pannier-Rack-Duo-Lowrider-1-700x525.jpg?resize=700%2C525&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4437" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tubus-Front-Pannier-Rack-Duo-Lowrider-1-700x525.jpg?resize=700%2C525&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tubus-Front-Pannier-Rack-Duo-Lowrider-1-700x525.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tubus-Front-Pannier-Rack-Duo-Lowrider-1-700x525.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>These Tubus Duo front racks are essentially really only good for bike touring. They do have some restrictions and are not the best racks out there. They are not suitable for mounting on spring or carbon forks without eyelets for example. But they do serve a specific purpose. Your bikes forks is required to have eyelets on the inside and outside for this rack to be the right choice. Tubus make some of the strongest racks systems and this rack is no different being able to tolerate extreme loads and fit almost all panniers. It features a longitudinal hole for optimal fit and increased flexibility. These are a lowrider rack that allows for room when installed on your touring bike to run a additional front rack like the Nitto Mini Front Rack which is next up. This low ride brings the centre of gravity of the panniers lower to the ground which is said to make the ride more stable. <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZvxdaR">Priced from <strong>$84.09</strong> on Amazon</a> You get a load capacity of 15 kg and the weight of the rack comes in at 560 grams.</p>



<h2>Nitto Mini Front Rack</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="477" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/c3891b942adcb5949a110de89f82d802e2da3fc7.jpeg?resize=720%2C477&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4438" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/c3891b942adcb5949a110de89f82d802e2da3fc7.jpeg?w=939&amp;ssl=1 939w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/c3891b942adcb5949a110de89f82d802e2da3fc7.jpeg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/c3891b942adcb5949a110de89f82d802e2da3fc7.jpeg?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/c3891b942adcb5949a110de89f82d802e2da3fc7.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Depending where you look for this Nitto Mini Front Rack it is sold out in most places. Please note that this rack has a 4.4 pound weight limit or around 2Kg. This is a strong rack, however it is recommended to use a tether to loop around the tongue of the rack and the handlebars. If you look closely a the photo above you will see a red tether. This rack is not for every bike and if you&#8217;re using V-brakes you may want to consider the Mark&#8217;s Rack instead. If the v-brake arms aren&#8217;t tall enough, they&#8217;ll block the rack mount from entering the fork crown. Best for a bike with cantilevers where you are looking for a smallish rack up there for a bag or basket or stuff-sack. This is a rack that is also used for mounting Rando bags. </p>



<h2>Tubus Tara</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2151186272_4f3d293008_b.jpg?fit=640%2C853&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4441" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2151186272_4f3d293008_b.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2151186272_4f3d293008_b.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2151186272_4f3d293008_b.jpg?resize=38%2C50&amp;ssl=1 38w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Tubus Tara another Lowrider rack option. This particular front rack has been around for over 25 years and over that time it has made some slight improvements here and there. Three individual holes were turned into one longitudinal hole. The entire mounting to the fork has been improved, making the TARA even more compatible with various forks allowing a more ­flexible positioning. And in addition, they also upgraded their classic lowrider with a light attachment. A straight forward design that is rather easy to install. With a loading capacity of 18 kg or 39.6 lbs. The weight of the standard rack is 500 grams or 17.6 oz and for the Big Apple 510 grams or 18 oz. <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZzeXxC">Priced from $120.00 on Amazon.</a></p>



<h2>Surly Touring Front Rack</h2>

<p>These kind of front racks are my favourite, the design I mean. Like on the Trek 520 these racks allow for many different mounting options. You can run panniers low and high. With a top platform above the wheel for attaching a tent or sleeping bag. Made from Surly you can have certainty that this rack is strong and durable just like their bikes. Made from tubular Chromoly steel these racks have been used on expeditions all over this planet for years.&nbsp;This rack fits on many of Surly&#8217;s forks and fits some other manufacturer forks as well. It includes all the stainless steel hardware you need for installation. It’s both height adjustable and can fit a wide selection of wheel sizes, allowing you to keep the center of gravity as low as possible for a stable ride. It is a beast of a front rack with the ability to carry a capacity of 32kg (70lb) and weighs in on the heavier side at 1,382 grams. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FSurly-Cromoly-Front-Rack-20">Priced from $145 on Jenson USA.</a></p>



<h2>Blackburn Bootlegger</h2>

<p>Blackburn make some more budget friendly bikepacking and touring gear. Their Bootlegger front rack is one of a couple that they make. This one is the more popular with the bike adventurers I asked for this article. Offer a useful flat platform it mounts with attachment clamps to your bikes front fork. And requires eyelet mounting near the axle. Allowing you to carry up to 45 pounds or around 20 kgs of your gear. And the rack weighs in at 917 grams. It also includes a cargo net and light mount. Made from a Aluminum construction. <a href="https://amzn.to/2QBA12q">The rack is priced at $65.00</a></p>



<h2>Bontrager Carry Forward Front Rack</h2>

<p>If you are looking to get a Randonneur handlebar bag for heaps of space to carry what your need, then this VO Platform front rack is perfect.

<p>A well made and heavy duty front rack option that is again very similar to some of the previous rack options when it comes to design. It offers a flat platform. Unfortunately there was not that much that I could find on the sale page for this rack. but it was recommended by a couple bike travellers. Very expensive options at $280.00 they are custom made. One of the better designed racks in this list.  </p>

<p>The last Pizza style front rack in this list comes from Specialized, they actually named this one the &#8216;Pizza Rack&#8217;. For obvious reasons. This rack is able to hold sizeable cargo, up to 15 kilograms (33lbs), rather comfortably. They also considered room for panniers, allowing your to accommodate any side panniers with hooks that fit on 13mm or larger rails. Priced at $90. It is a nice little touch that it comes packed in a box that resembles a pizza box. </p>



<h2>Hellraiser Rack</h2>

<p>The last rack for this blog post is rather different then most the other mentioned here. If you are after a front bike rack that is different then this might be for you. A very stylish front bike rack that is a great addition to your bike. It is best for someone who is a commuter. Although on their site they mention that this rack has survived car crashes it seems like a rather tough rack.</p>
