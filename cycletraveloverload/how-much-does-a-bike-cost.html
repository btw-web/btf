<p>How much does a bike cost? How long is a piece of string? How big is space? How old is time? All very similar questions.</p>



<p style="text-align:left">The perception of what is expensive differs between everyone. In this article we are going to unpick the different price levels of road and mountain bikes. What you spend on a bike largely depends on your level of riding, what you’re using it for and obviously, your budget. You don’t want to be ‘all the gear, no idea’ guy. Equally, you don’t want to be trudging behind your mates because you’ve bought insufficient equipment.</p>



<p><strong>How much should I pay for a bicycle?</strong></p>



<p>Before we answer this question you need to ask yourself a few of the following questions:</p>



<ol><li>Is your bike your main mode of transport?</li><li>Is cycling a weekend hobby?&nbsp;</li><li>Is cycling something you just do with your kids?</li><li>Is this your first race, or are you thinking about racing?</li><li>Will you be racing to a high standard, trying to shave off seconds?</li><li>Are you taking on extreme or easy trails?</li><li>Are you taking it on extended bikepacking or touring trips?</li><li>How much spare cash have you got?</li></ol>



<p>If this is your first bike, you consider yourself entry level or a beginner you definitely shouldn’t be spending mega bucks on your bike. You need to look at something easy to ride, comfortable and inexpensive. This bike needs to encourage you to keep riding and bring you joy. It doesn’t necessarily need to be branded, you’ll pay more for this. Brands like Decathlon from Europe are a great place to look.</p>



<p>If you are looking to upgrade to your racing bike then moving up a price bracket will probably come in useful. You will need to look at something lightweight, easy to ride and responsive. You don’t need to go straight in at the full carbon aerodynamic frame end as you’re skill level won’t see the benefits for the money you spend. Looking at an aluminium frame with carbon forks is the best affordable option here.</p>



<p>If you are trying out mountain biking you probably won’t be hitting the extreme trails first, so you don’t need to invest in the full suspension carbon frame that is designed for those terrains. You will be best off looking at cheaper hardtails. Likewise, if you’re starting to progress and need a bike to progress with you we will cover the top end of the mountain bike world too.</p>



<p>If your bike is your main mode of transport, think about what you would spend on a car? The price of a bike quickly doesn’t seem so much!</p>



<p><strong>Is an expensive bike worth it?</strong></p>



<p>If you are an experienced cyclist then spending a bit more on your bike can definitely be worth it. However, sometimes you pay for a brand name rather than the actual specifications of the bike and this is something we will try and cover. Similarly, you can often reap more benefits from upgrading your kit before upgrading your bike. For example, progressing from basic pedals to cleats on your road bike, or going tubeless on your mountain bike. </p>



<p><strong>Why are bikes so expensive?</strong></p>



<p>There is a lot of engineering that goes into creating the precise geometry for a comfortable and efficient ride. Bikes have a lot of different components that all need to work in sync with each other. Cheap, steel department store bikes do not have the brains behind them. They are mass produced and the sizing often isn’t complimentary to anything other than a Sunday potter with the kids. On the other side, the guys at Specialized have teams of people researching and developing the aerodynamics, noise absorption, suspension, geometry etc. All this is time and money which needs to be made back on the cost of the bikes.</p>



<p>Materials are the main cost incurred on a bike. One carbon fibre bike isn’t the same as the next. Once you get into the high level bikes even the direction of the carbon fibre layers has been thought about to give the most comfortable and efficient ride. They often have parts that are unique shapes which require unique moulds to be made. They need to ensure quality in every single bike so my Trek Madone in Australia is the same as your Trek Madone in the UK. All of this comes at a cost. High end bikes come with high end parts at the point of sale or offering customisation which again, adds to the cost. </p>



<p><strong>How much does a road bike cost?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Entry level</strong></p>



<p>Looking at buying your first road bike? You can get some great aluminium bikes and probably sneak in Carbon forks for your money these days, and hope to get years of trouble-free joy out of them. All prices are approximate.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.giant-bicycles.com/au/contend-2-2019"><strong>Giant Contend 2: $999</strong></a></p>



<p>This is a lightweight entry level aluminium bike with Carbon forks for all round road riding. It’s comfort fit with a great paint job and fixings for mudguards. Perfect for commuting or joyful Sunday sessions.</p>



<p><a href="https://decathlon.com.au/collections/road-bikes"><strong>Decathlon Triban 520: $1,350</strong></a></p>



<p>They might not be known for the neatest welds but this French brand is praised for their high spec but low priced bikes. Comfort fit, with Shimano’s 105 group set and hydro disc brakes.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.specialized.com/au/en/shop/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/allez/c/allez"><strong>Specialized Allez: $1,250</strong></a></p>



<p>Specialized most popular entry level road bike. Aluminium frame with Carbon forks and integrated brake cables. Similar geometry and weight to the Giant Contend 2 for comfortable but speedy handling leaving critics saying you pay more for the brand name.</p>



<p><strong>Intermediate</strong></p>



<p>You’ve been cycling for a while and are starting to take on some more exciting or longer rides then you’ll want to be sitting in this expansive price bracket. You can now be looking at basic Carbon frames with speedier geometry. This is a big category in terms of price so we have included a range of examples.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cannondale.com/en/bikes/road/race/caad12/caad12-ultegra"><strong>Cannondale CAAD12 Ultegra: $3,799</strong></a></p>



<p>Cannondale has a great reputation. They have focussed their efforts on producing light and high quality aluminium road bikes to keep their costs down for the intermediate riders. This aluminium frame with carbon fork weighs only 7.5kg!</p>



<p><a href="https://www.specialized.com/au/en/mens-tarmac-expert/p/133929"><strong>Specialized Tarmac Expert: $5,000</strong></a></p>



<p>At the top of the ‘intermediate’ category. It is light and fast. Specialized claims it is 45 seconds faster over 40km than its predecessors. If you’re looking to shave seconds off your time but haven’t got the extreme budget, this is a great quality bike.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/au/en_AU/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/%C3%A9monda/c/B211/"><strong>Trek Edmonda SL 6 pro: $5,499</strong></a></p>



<p>Carbon frame and forks and Shimano Ultegra groupset. Claiming to be the “lightest line of production road bikes ever offered”. Very highly reviewed speedy but comfortable bike, bargain for the spec.</p>



<p><strong>Pro</strong></p>



<p>If you have more money than you know what to do with then you can look at the most well researched, slickest bikes on the planet:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/madone/madone-sl/madone-sl-7/p/28713/"><strong>Trek Madone SL 7: $9000</strong></a></p>



<p>Trek are boasting about this ‘superbike’ having some of the best power transfer and ride quality on the market. It’s got tubeless wheels, aerodynamic shaped tubes and integrated front end. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.lookcycle.com/fr-en/products/bikes/road-bikes/aero/795-light-rs"><strong>Look 795Aerolight RS: $12,800</strong></a></p>



<p>A very sexy and very fast looking bike with an integrated stem/handlebar/seatpost. The whole bike weights only 7.7kg. Which some argue could be lighter for the price tag.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.specialized.com/au/en/s-works-venge-vias-di2/p/115098?color=196551-115098&amp;searchText=99016-0349"><strong>Specialized S-Works Venge Vias Di2: $13,600</strong></a></p>



<p>Specialized claims this is the fastest bike ever made. It’s unique tube shapes, the highest quality Carbon fibre and tubeless ready wheelset help make up the price tag.</p>



<p><strong>How much does a mountain bike cost?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Entry level hard tail bikes:</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.norco.com/bikes/mountain/"><strong>Norco Storm 5: $675</strong></a></p>



<p>Hardtail design with 2&#215;8 shimano drivetrain and hydraulic disc brakes. The geometry is designed to help you gain better climbing traction and better power efficiency. Performs very well for the price.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cube.eu/en/2020/bikes/mountainbike/hardtail/aim/cube-aim-sl-iridiumnred-2020/"><strong>CUBE AIM SL: $1,099</strong></a></p>



<p>Hard tail with remote lockout. Lightweight aluminium frame and 3&#215;9 speed shimano drivetrain. Hydraulic braking great performance bike without the price tag.</p>



<p><a href="https://silverbacklab.com/bike-model/mountainbikes/stride-29-elite-sl/"><strong>Silverback Stride Elite SL 29: $1,199</strong></a></p>



<p>Hydroformed aluminium alloy frame, hardtail design, internal cabling, hydraulic disc brakes and 3&#215;9 shimano drivetrain. This bike is tubeless ready and offers good clearance for fatter tyres. A very comfortable and responsive ride over all terrains.</p>



<p><strong>Intermediate level hard tail bikes</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.giant-bicycles.com/au/fathom-29-1"><strong>Giant Fathom 29 1: $2,299</strong></a></p>



<p>You can rely on Giant bikes, and this one is exceptionally good value for money. 1&#215;11 shimano SLX drivetrain, 11-46 cassette, internal cable routing and hydraulic brakes. It’s got the features of an expensive bike without you having to pay for it. Maybe add in the dropper post too if you’ve got the budget.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/international/en_IN_TL/bikes/mountain-bikes/trail-mountain-bikes/stache/stache-5/p/23107/"><strong>Trek Stache 5: $1,890</strong></a></p>



<p>This bike is the one for chunky terrain. 29+ tyres, tubeless ready, floating on 120mm forks. Trek have also elevated the drive side chainstay to shorten the rear centre geometry making it pretty reactive. You can take it anywhere and have a lot of fun doing so.</p>



<p><strong>High spec full suspension bikes:</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.giant-bicycles.com/au/anthem-advanced-pro-29-1"><strong>Giant Anthem Advance PRo 29 1: $6299</strong></a></p>



<p>Favouring the XC scene. Full Carbon frame and half the price of it’s advanced brother. The Maestro system sits low and central, it remains fully active during pedalling and braking. On bar lockout if firm and efficient. This bike flies around the trails and also on the tarmac.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.specialized.com/au/en/shop/bikes/mountain-bikes/cross-country-mountain-bikes/epic/c/epic"><strong>Specialized Epic Pro: $13,000</strong></a></p>



<p>This bike is made for racing and is responsive to different terrains with its ‘Brain’ technology. There are no pivots in the rear triangle but it relays on its vertical flex, the rear ‘Brain’ is actually situated just behind the rear axle allowing Specialized to move the brake calliper onto the chainstay. Fully adjustable system ranges from the most aggressive to a passive option. 100mm travel in the Rockshox Brain. </p>
