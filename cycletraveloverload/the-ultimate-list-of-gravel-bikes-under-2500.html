<p>These bikes are some of the better quality and built bikes then some of the rest I have discussed in other articles. You can expect all these bikes to have hydraulic disc brakes. And they are either steel builds or alloy / carbon or full carbon builds. No full alloy builds here as this is the cheapest option for bike builders to produce bikes and lets face it not the best overall material for gravel bikes. The carbon forks provide extra suppleness and ride quality. </p>



<p>I mention this in the earlier articles. But when looking at gravel bikes the main two things to consider is the bikes specs or the quality and performance of components. And also the geometry of the bike. Some bikes are designed around a speedy/racer geometry which is less comfortable for longer rides. And some are designed with adventure geometry, meaning they accomodate for longer days in the saddle. When looking at a bikes geometry you want to look at the bikes; reach, stack, , wheelbase and chainstay length, Trail, BB height. I will try my best to describe each bikes geometry and how it fits into riding feel. </p>



<h2>Cannondale Topstone Apex 1</h2>

<p>An aluminium frame and carbon fork build, you a mid-range level SHRAM APEX 1 drivetrain on this bike (there is better option like Rival 1) but you get Apex Alloy, 40T crank and SRAM PG-1130, 11-42, 11-speed cassette. Also a TranzX Dropper Seatpost, 50mm travel, 27.2 x 365mm. The trail on the medium size is 65, this put it at a mid to high end when compared to other gravel bikes making the front end ride feel predictable and stable. While the chainstay length is in that mid range making it ride like a all-rounder with some quickness to it. You get the top tube mounts and rear rack mounts, no fork mounts though. I do feel that the stack is a little high on this bike. Priced at $2,100</p>



<h2>2020 Kona Sutra LTD</h2>

<p>I had to fit this bike in the list. This is my personal steed and it works wonders. Considered a gravel/touring/adventure bike it is the best gravel bike that can go on around the world epic bikepacking and bike touring adventures. Designed with a 445 mm chainstay length it puts it in the longer section for gravel bikes. But this means it is a all-rounder and a more chill feel at the rear. And it rides rather quick too. The front trail is 63 which still makes it ride with stability and it is predictable. The clearance for 60mm plus wide tires was what appealed to me so much. The stock 50mm add that extra suppleness for the rough stuff. You also get that long wheel base similar to a touring bike for stability and well balanced riding, when loaded up. Along with the triple mounts on the fork and a all round steel bike it is my dream bike that has come true! it comes with a upper-mid range SRAM Rival 1 drivetrain with Race Face 36t Narrow/Wide crank and SRAM XG1150 10-42t 11spd cassette. Making it decent a climbing hills even when you are carting gear. It rides so smooth when under a load. Priced at $2,199</p>



<h2>2020 Marin Gestalt X11</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="702" height="447" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY19-Gestalt-X11-P-Final.jpg?resize=702%2C447&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5588" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY19-Gestalt-X11-P-Final.jpg?w=702&amp;ssl=1 702w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY19-Gestalt-X11-P-Final.jpg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY19-Gestalt-X11-P-Final.jpg?resize=50%2C32&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Marin make some budget friendly gravel bikes but they also have more advanced or premium level rides too. And this is not different with their Gestalt X11. A SRAM Rival 1 11-Speed bike with FSA Gossamer Pro, Megatooth 42T Crank and SRAM XG-1150 11-Speed, 10-42T. It is a bigger sized front crank so I theory it might not preform as well for climbs then something like the Sutra with 36t. However the bike is a alloy frame and carbon fork build, which provides a supple and smooth ride. With a TranzX YSP11 Dropper Post, 105mm Travel, 27.2mm. The bike comes with WTB, Riddler TCS Light, 700Cx37, tires. The trail is at 67 on this bike, which is on the high end and can make this bike feel either stable and potentially a little sluggish in the front. And the chainstay length is on the shorter side for gravel bikes at 415mm. This can make it feel quick and jumpy to control in the rear. For those looking for a fast paced gravel bike this might be for you. Still good for adventures but there are better options like the Sutra. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FMarin-Gestalt-X11-Bike-2020">Priced at $2,099.99 at REI.com</a></p>

<p>A full carbon gravel bike just inside he $2,500 budget range. You get high end components with the Shimano GRX groupset, featuring a Shimano RX600 46/30 crank and Shimano HG700 11-34 cassette. One of the stand outs for this bike is the very unique hover bar aka the CP07 Gravel Cockpit. The Pro Geometry combines outstanding stability with agility and works well across a range of terrain and comfort for the long haul. The medium sized for example when it comes to geometry has a 425 mm chainstay length which is rather short making it feel quick and snappy in the rear. Unfortunately this bike lacks any mounts for racks or cargo cages. The bike comes with the Schwalbe G-One Bite 40 mm tires. <a href="https://www.canyon.com/en-au/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/grail/grail-cf-sl-7.0/2374.html">Priced at $2,499.00</a></p>



<h2>2020 Giant Revolt Advanced 2</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="436" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY20RevoltADV2_ColorA.jpg?resize=720%2C436&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5590" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY20RevoltADV2_ColorA.jpg?w=774&amp;ssl=1 774w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY20RevoltADV2_ColorA.jpg?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY20RevoltADV2_ColorA.jpg?resize=768%2C465&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY20RevoltADV2_ColorA.jpg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Another full carbon option is the Giant Revolt Advanced 2 which comes in a little cheaper then the Canyon. But you do get a upper mid-rang component level with Shimano 105, and Praxis Alba, 32/48 crank with Shimano 105, 11&#215;34 cassette. You do get one mounting option on the fork. The chainstay length on the Giant is the same as the Canyon making it yet again another bike that is rather quick and snappy in the rear. The trail is a high range for gravel bikes, meaning it in theory would be stable but potentially sluggish. The bike comes with the Giant Crosscut AT 1, 700&#215;38 tires. <a href="https://www.giant-bicycles.com/au/revolt-advanced-2">Priced at $2,450.00</a></p>



<h2>2019 Fuji Jari 1.1</h2>

<p>The geometry of the Fuji Jari 1.1 is in that range where it would be suitable for long adventures and still offer decent comfort. You get a trail of 67 which puts it in the stable range of gravel bikes and the chainstay length of 435 mm which makes it a all-rounder in the rear. It is not as long as the Sutra in the rear, meaning it is not the most stable but still offer some stability while being on the line of chill and quick. The bike also offers many mounting options on top tube, forks, frame. Even has hidden fender mounts. Plus a little extra bonus addition is the padding under the top tube for carrying the bike on your shoulder. The bike also features Fuji&#8217;s adventure geometry. A long wheelbase and slack headtube and seattube angles that provides stability and positions the rider over the rear wheel for increased traction and control. Features a Shimano 105 groupset with FSA Omega Adventure BB386 EVO, 46/30T crank and Shimano 105, 11-34T cassette. <a href="https://www.fujibikes.com/usa/bikes/road/adventure-and-touring/jari/jari-1-1">Priced at $2,299</a></p>



<h2>2021 Trek Checkpoint ALR 5</h2>

<p>The 2021 model Trek Checkpoint ALR 5 actually offers decent value for a high component level bike. Featuring a similar groupset to the Canyon you get that plus mounting potions on top tube and fork. However you are looking at a alloy bike with carbon forks instead of full carbon. The bike has a fairly high trail at around 61 meaning it offer stability in this aspect and a 425 mm chainstay length which is short for gravel bikes and offer quick and snappy control in the rear.

<p>Norco make some of the best gravel bikes. This bike is a steel frame and carbon fork combination offering optimal suppleness and comfort. You get mounting options on the fork and for rear racks. Not the most highest quality components with the Shimano GRX 600, GRX 400 groupset. With Shimano GRX FC-RX600 46/30T crank and Shimano CS-HG50-10 11-36T cassette.

<p>This has to be on of my top 3 favourite in this list. Part has to do with the brand name and the looks. The chainstay length is on the quick and shorter side at 425 mm. With a trail at 66 it is stable, just in that high category for gravel bikes. You get A GRX 1&#215;11 groupset, it is disappointing that you get limiting mounting on this bike with eyelets. The 650b WTB Sendero 47C Road Plus tires finish this bike off nicely. The groupset gives you a Shimano RX-810 40t crank and Shimano CS-M8000 XT, 11-42T cassette. With versatility, strength and comfort at a low-weight, this Digger-model is an exceptional roller on the tarmac, provides the utmost confidence and control on the trail while ensuring you have the greatest comfort for long-distance touring ventures. <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=12444&amp;awinaffid=604347&amp;clickref=&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiggle.com.au%2Fnukeproof-digger-275-factory-gravel-bike-2020%2F">Priced at just over $2,000</a></p>
