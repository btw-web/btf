<p>If you are like me and love New Zealand, then these are some bikepacking routes you gotta put on your dream list! I have not been to New Zealand, yet! But I have heard so much great things about the place and from pictures those mountains looks stunning!</p>



<p>I have always wanted to go and do a epic bikepacking adventure over there. And I think I have found it! In this article I researched all over the web for some bikepacking routes to do in New Zealand. From my research I was unable to find that many. If you had better luck then me or you have been on your own bikepakcing made trail in New Zealand do please let me know. </p>



<p>But for this post we have 5 potential amazing bikepacking routes to choose from or you could do them all. Starting from easy weekenders to a epic 3000 Km mission. I think I am going to head over to New Zealand soon to have a crack at the 3,000 Km one! </p>



<p>The criteria for making this list is the route has to be epic! In distance and in scenery! But I have also include some routes that are probably better for the beginner or someone just getting starting in this wonderful world of bikepacking. The first three are the ones I want to have a crack at most especially the first route mentioned below. </p>



<p>I should have been to New Zealand earlier, being from Victoria, Australia. You know it is just over the pond! I have been touring in many other countries but not the neighbours. Oh, look now I am starting to plan this epic adventure. Are you as excited as me? Lets get into these routes.</p>



<ul><li>Tour Aotearoa</li><li>The Old Ghost Road </li><li>Northern Loop No. 8 Wired</li></ul>

<p>The Tour Aotearoa route is open to the public all year round, however, the best time to ride is in the late summer and early autumn. Keep in mind that the later you embark the less daylight you will have, but that there will also be less traffic on the roads and more options when it comes to accomodation. But try a prevent yourself for attempting it in winter if you can as the tracks will be too muddy! Also if you can try and word around going between 24 December &#8211; February as the summer holidays can make the roads busy. </p>

<p>Transportation is something to consider if you want to get a lift to the start of the route in Cape Reinga to follow it all the way south to Bluff. If you are flying into a main city like Auckland. You could get a shuttle and taxi vans that usually take bikes. Or planes or buses. However as a recent, transport from Auckland to Kaitaia (which is still 111 km from the Cape Reinga starting point) is no-longer straightforward. InterCity have switched to using buses on this route with too little cargo space, so that option is no longer available. You can fly with Barrier Air or hire a car. From Kaitaia you could get a one way shuttle that might be the best bet or just ride out to Cape.</p>

<p>With ferries if you choose to follow this route to a tee it will involve 5 of them. They are more costly then I have experienced with ferries in other countries. But if you wanted you could possibly look at alternative ways to navigate around, I am not sure if it is possible have not looked that far into it as of yet. </p>

<p>If you are looking for something shorter but still epic the Old Ghost Road has you covered! It is one of the best longest singletrack rides in New Zealand. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In the North West corner of the South Island of New Zealand a ghost has awakened. A long-forgotten gold miners’ road has been revived as a mountain biking and tramping trail – connecting the old dray road in the Lyell (Upper Buller Gorge) to the mighty Mokihinui River in the north. The 85km-long Old Ghost Road traverses majestic native forest, open tussock tops, river flats and forgotten valleys.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are up for something a little less demanding then the previous 3,000 Km route, this one might be for you! It is a great route for a weekender or maybe allow 4 days. A little longer then the Ghost route but not as much climbing per Km. </p>
