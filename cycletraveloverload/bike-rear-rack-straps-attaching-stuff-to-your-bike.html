<p>If you are bike touring you are going to eventually need to think about how you will be securing gear on the top of your rear rack. For me I have always just used generic bungee cords, but they take a certain technique to hook it on properly. And sometimes they can dig into the bag or whatever you are storing on the top of the rack. Also they start to tear and rip over time. </p>



<p>I try my best to pack minimally when I go on a bike tour. But I always find myself storing either my tent or sleeping pad, with a camera tripod and maybe even my thongs (flip flops). All on the top of the rear rack. Because there is no way they are going to fit in my panniers. </p>



<p>Maybe you are needing to carry extra gear for a very isolated tour and you need more water. Strapping it to the back of your bike is a great way to make the most of your hauling power. Also you don&#8217;t want to have stuff fly off the back of your bike never to be seen again. I once heard a horror story from a bike tourer I was talking to on tour and they told me about how they had lost a bag bungeed to their back rack. </p>



<p>I asked other bike tourers and with the combination of my own experience. To see what methods work well for securing luggage to the back of your bike? Here is a quick list of the different straps, nets, cords and other attachment gadgets for your reference. </p>



<ul><li>Voile Straps</li><li>Rok Straps Commuter</li><li>Surly Loop Junk Straps</li><li>Velcro Brand Straps</li><li>Compression Straps</li><li>Cargo Nets</li><li>Generic Bungee Cords</li><li>Used Inner Tubes</li></ul>



<p>The first three recommendations are the best option but if you are in a pinch you can get by with using inner tubes or just using generic bungee cords. But lets get into some of your most secure options. </p>



<h2>Voile Straps</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="638" height="481" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-29.jpeg?resize=638%2C481&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3815" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-29.jpeg?w=638&amp;ssl=1 638w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-29.jpeg?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-29.jpeg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Voile Straps have been around for over three decades and they were designed to be used in the skiing world. But lately they have gained popularity in the bikepacking and touring world. Bike adventurers all over they world are using them to attach stuff to their bikes in the most creative ways. A truely versatile product. But not only that, they are great to attach bags or whatever else to your rear rack making a handy touring bike bungee. </p>



<p>Theses straps are a incredible way to secure, bundle, and repair almost anything on the go. They come in four different versions and you even get the choice to customise them with your name which is pretty cool. </p>



<p>The Nano straps are available in many sizes from 6&#8243; to 16&#8243; (15 cm to 40.5 cm) these have a tough nylon buckle that is strong, non-conductive, and non-marring. You also can get the Aluminium Buckle Straps, Nylon Buckle Straps, or the XL Series Straps. </p>



<p>There is great variety of sizes to suit whatever mounting purpose you have. But for mounting gear on a rear rack the offer up to their largest 32&#8243; (81 cm) size strap which would be more then enough. Even if you get a few of them they would make a great securing strap for bike touring. </p>



<p>The thing people find best about these straps compared to hook and loop straps and many others is the ease of use. They work with cargo cages for bikepacking and just as well on racks. You should read the reviews if you don&#8217;t believe me, people are mentioning constantly how great these straps are, they are super tough. Have not seen one fail yet! They are cheap starting from $7.00 each </p>



<h2>Rok Straps Commuter</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="550" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71q5DVsiUAL._SL1008_.jpg?resize=720%2C550&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3816" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71q5DVsiUAL._SL1008_.jpg?w=1008&amp;ssl=1 1008w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71q5DVsiUAL._SL1008_.jpg?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71q5DVsiUAL._SL1008_.jpg?resize=768%2C587&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/71q5DVsiUAL._SL1008_.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>These straps are actually designed for this very purpose of strapping stuff down to your rear rack. They are a Australian brand, and good on them for creating a niche product like this. It is perfect for bike touring. They are very similar to Pack Straps but specifically designed to attach and secure smaller items onto scooters, motorcycle luggage, scooters, bicycles and back packs. Without damaging waterproof material. The quick release buckles ensure fast access to your gear. </p>



<p>They are available in different colors, and with a reflective design for your safety. They are available up to 28’’ (720mm) and can confidently secure up to 18KG of gear. </p>

<h2>Surly Loop Junk Straps</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="404" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-30.jpeg?resize=720%2C404&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3818" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-30.jpeg?w=739&amp;ssl=1 739w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-30.jpeg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-30.jpeg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Surly make the regular Junk Strap and this Loop Junk Strap which are both made from the same 120cm woven nylon strap with the same stainless-steel buckle. However this Loop Junk Strap also has a loop sewn at each end of the strap so you can wrap them around small diameter tubing like that used for racks and handlebars. They secure in the middle with the stainless-steel buckle. Surly made them as they offer another method for those wanting to secure cargo to their racks and/or bikes. </p>



<h2>Velcro Brand Straps</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="356" height="267" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-31.jpeg?resize=356%2C267&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3821" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-31.jpeg?w=356&amp;ssl=1 356w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-31.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-31.jpeg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The VELCRO Brand straps are another option recommended by other bike tourers. They are pretty straight forward and easy to use. </p>



<h2>Compression Straps</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="440" height="440" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/29db7185-2fb0-4045-84a0-9a8cebcdefe6.jpeg?resize=440%2C440&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3820" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/29db7185-2fb0-4045-84a0-9a8cebcdefe6.jpeg?w=440&amp;ssl=1 440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/29db7185-2fb0-4045-84a0-9a8cebcdefe6.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/29db7185-2fb0-4045-84a0-9a8cebcdefe6.jpeg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/29db7185-2fb0-4045-84a0-9a8cebcdefe6.jpeg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>These straps are solidly woven and the buckle that secures the straps doesn’t come loose when riding for countless days that the same way that bungee cords tend to slide around. They are also great at fastening your panniers to the rack if you are riding over some bumpy terrain. </p>



<h2>Cargo Nets</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="459" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/89f4dfc6-47d3-4778-8ce8-9a571a8ce320.jpeg?resize=720%2C459&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3819" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/89f4dfc6-47d3-4778-8ce8-9a571a8ce320.jpeg?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/89f4dfc6-47d3-4778-8ce8-9a571a8ce320.jpeg?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/89f4dfc6-47d3-4778-8ce8-9a571a8ce320.jpeg?resize=768%2C490&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/89f4dfc6-47d3-4778-8ce8-9a571a8ce320.jpeg?resize=50%2C32&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Cargo nets are another good solution to fixing gear to your bike. They act like many bungee cords in one with multiple hooks. They are best for mounting items that are preferably not meant to be crushed like bread or delicate or oddly shaped items. </p>



<h2>Generic Bungee Cords</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="620" height="415" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-32.jpeg?resize=620%2C415&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3822" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-32.jpeg?w=620&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-32.jpeg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-32.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>These are the easiest and most widely found bike rack straps that you can use. If you don&#8217;t have any and need some you could find them in most $2 shops or hardware stores around the world. They are great and I have been using them, they seem to last for a few months. </p>



<h2>Used Inner Tubes</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="350" height="291" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-33.jpeg?resize=350%2C291&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3823" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-33.jpeg?w=350&amp;ssl=1 350w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-33.jpeg?resize=300%2C249&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-33.jpeg?resize=50%2C42&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>I have heard many bike tourers use their old bike inner tubes and mounting gear to their bike with them. Very creative and it is free. No need to go out and by other straps. reuse and recycle is always a good idea. </p>
