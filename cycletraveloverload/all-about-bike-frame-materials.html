<p>Seen a new bamboo frame you fancy taking on the trails? Or maybe a funky see-through plastic one to parade the streets with? Have you been looking into the future of isotruss frames?</p>



<p>Odds are you’re not, you’re probably going to be looking at steel, aluminium, titanium or carbon. These are the 4 most common options. In this article we will be demystifying their properties to help you decide which one is right for you.</p>



<p>There’s no right or wrong answer. They all have different strengths and weaknesses. It all depends on what you want from your bike, where you are taking it and what your budget is.</p>



<p><strong>Aluminium bike frames</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="540" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bike-Europe-Triangles-Portugal-Alloy-Bike-Frames.jpg?resize=720%2C540&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6020" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bike-Europe-Triangles-Portugal-Alloy-Bike-Frames.jpg?w=4320&amp;ssl=1 4320w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bike-Europe-Triangles-Portugal-Alloy-Bike-Frames.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bike-Europe-Triangles-Portugal-Alloy-Bike-Frames.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bike-Europe-Triangles-Portugal-Alloy-Bike-Frames.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bike-Europe-Triangles-Portugal-Alloy-Bike-Frames.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bike-Europe-Triangles-Portugal-Alloy-Bike-Frames.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bike-Europe-Triangles-Portugal-Alloy-Bike-Frames.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Let’s start with the most common material option. This is due to it’s lightweight nature and it is very cheap to manufacture. It is also resistant to corrosion making it a good all rounder. Aluminium can be mounded into aerodynamic shapes using hydro forming. This process means you can get fancy frames for a fraction of the price of those made from carbon. The nature of the lightweight tubes of aluminium leave it not as strong as steel. Their relative lack of strength can make their lifetimes shorter than the other frame material options, but if treated right this can still be longer than you will ever need it for. This is the most cost effective frame option for any rider.</p>



<p><strong>Steel bike frames</strong></p>

<p>Steel is the original workhorse of the bike frame industry. It is cheap, strong and durable. Because it is so strong the tubes can be made very thin, this introduces a lot more vertical flex making for a smoother ride. These frames will go and go and keep you comfortable throughout. It is heavier than all the other materials and is therefore not really used for bikes made for speed. These days, often manufacturers use steel to create entry level bikes or those you would find in department stores rather than specialised high end bike shops, or on custom builds. The downfall of steel is that it is susceptible to corrosion so if it isn’t looked after the lifespan will be significantly reduced, especially if you live by the sea.</p>



<p><strong>Titanium bike frames</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="435" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GXR_Feagle_Side1800_trandf_1024x.png?resize=720%2C435&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6022" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GXR_Feagle_Side1800_trandf_1024x.png?w=1013&amp;ssl=1 1013w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GXR_Feagle_Side1800_trandf_1024x.png?resize=300%2C181&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GXR_Feagle_Side1800_trandf_1024x.png?resize=768%2C464&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GXR_Feagle_Side1800_trandf_1024x.png?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The up market older brother of the metal categories. Titanium is a rare and therefore expensive metal so it is often reserved for custom builds. It is very unreactive to the elements and often doesn’t need painting as a result, meaning you can have a sexy raw metal finish on your touring bike which will last for years. Despite its stiffness, titanium is known for its ride quality. It is able to absorb a lot of road noise making it popular for touring or hardtail mountain bikes. Titanium is relatively light for how stiff it is adding to its popularity. The downside is the price, it is a rare metal and is very labour intensive to work with leaving the beautiful custom bikes in the higher price bracket. </p>



<p><strong>Carbon bike frames</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="419" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C21_C15501M_Topstone_Crb_4_CHP_PD_2000x.jpg?resize=720%2C419&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6023" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C21_C15501M_Topstone_Crb_4_CHP_PD_2000x.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C21_C15501M_Topstone_Crb_4_CHP_PD_2000x.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C21_C15501M_Topstone_Crb_4_CHP_PD_2000x.jpg?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C21_C15501M_Topstone_Crb_4_CHP_PD_2000x.jpg?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C21_C15501M_Topstone_Crb_4_CHP_PD_2000x.jpg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C21_C15501M_Topstone_Crb_4_CHP_PD_2000x.jpg?resize=346%2C200&amp;ssl=1 346w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/C21_C15501M_Topstone_Crb_4_CHP_PD_2000x.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Topstone Carbon 4 &#8211; PD</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The ultimate lightweight and flexible bike frame material. It is the stiffest per gram than the others. One of the main bonuses of this ‘super material’ is that it is made up of layers of carbon fibre which can be moulded to any shape. This allows it to be formed into more aerodynamic postures for road bikes. You can also align the carbon in different ways to get varying amounts of stiffness. This means you can get different parts of the bike made from the same material but behaving in different ways, for the ultimate efficiency and comfort. Our previous article on seatposts showed how important they are for eliminating road buzz. The seatpost carbon can be aligned so that it absorbs road noise while the bottom bracket can be aligned in a more rigid orientation for stability. This flexibility does mean it is more susceptible to fracture than it’s rigid metal cousins. It is also unreactive to the elements. With this level of weightlessness, flexibility and anti-corrosion properties comes a price tag. Carbon fibre frames tend to be the most expensive out of the 4 options.</p>



<p><strong>What will you use your bike for?</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4806-3.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6024" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4806-3.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4806-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_4806-3.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Touring and adventure</strong></p>



<p>If you are going to be spending hours on your bike carrying heavy loads and going through different climates then you may want to consider a titanium frame. This material offers great noise absorption, anti-corrosion and longevity. These frames are stiff and able to take the heavy loads of fully packed panniers. The titanium won’t rust so you can go through whatever crazy weather you want to. Due to these factors they tend to last years and years, with most custom builds coming with a lifetime guarantee on manufacturing faults. If you don’t have the budget for titanium then you can look at steel frames. These are more common and offer similar durability and strength for the loads but do need maintenance to avoid rusting. Touring cyclists often praise steel frames for their ride comfort. If your bike becomes damaged during an adventure a steel frame is much easier to fix than the other materials. </p>



<p><strong>Road racing</strong></p>



<p>In this category you need to be thinking about speed and weight. Carbon fibre is your friend here. It can be moulded to any aerodynamic shape you want. The nature of the layered carbon means it absorbs road noise very well so you can convert all that energy into speed without added fatigue. If you can’t afford carbon then aluminium is the next best. It remains lightweight but you will get more road buzz. These days you can get hydroformed aluminium frames which offer the same aerodynamic shapes as carbon fibre. </p>



<p><strong>Mountain biking</strong></p>



<p>Most modern mountain bikes are made from aluminium or carbon fibre due to their lightweight and corrosion resistant nature. If you have a rigid bike then the aluminium can be less forgiving. If you have suspension then this can be a great cheaper option. Carbon fibre lends itself to dampening and comfort whilst being lightweight, despite its price reducing over the years it is still the most expensive option.</p>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><br></td><td>price</td><td>road buzz</td><td>lifetime</td><td>strength&nbsp;</td><td>weight</td><td>road bike</td><td>touring</td><td>MTB</td></tr><tr><td>aluminium&nbsp;</td><td>$</td><td>++</td><td>++</td><td>++</td><td>++</td><td>++</td><td><br></td><td>++</td></tr><tr><td>steel</td><td>$</td><td>++</td><td>++</td><td>+++</td><td>+++</td><td><br></td><td>++</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td>carbon</td><td>$$$</td><td>+</td><td>+++</td><td>++</td><td>+</td><td>+++</td><td><br></td><td>+++</td></tr><tr><td>titanium&nbsp;</td><td>$$$</td><td>++</td><td>++++</td><td>++++</td><td>+++</td><td><br></td><td>+++</td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>So, if you’re on a budget aluminium is the usual place to start for most bikes. If you’re not then carbon fibre is king for the road and the mountains and titanium for the adventures.</p>



<p>All manufacturers use the materials differently and will alloy their metals differently so no two aluminium bikes will be created equal. It is worth going into the specialist bike shop and having a chat with them about the different qualities each one has.</p>
