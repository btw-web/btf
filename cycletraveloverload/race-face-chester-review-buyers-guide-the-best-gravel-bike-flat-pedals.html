<p>Are you after some value pedals for your next bike adventure? Considered MTB medals I have been currently using these on my gravel/adventure bike and they have been working wonders. The Race Face Chester Pedals offer excellent grip with 8 replaceable hex traction pins per side. I personally like riding in flat pedals when on multi-day and even multi-month long adventures. Paired with some simple grippy shoes these pedal provide heaps of confidence and efficiency. Also due to the more technical terrain I have been choosing to ride lately it just makes sense for me. </p>



<p>Yes most if not all roadies out there will tell you how clipless is the way to go. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I started cycling as a road cyclist. I actually remember one of my first ever bunch rides with the fellas. I rocked up in a pair of converse sneakers and flat pedals. They laughed me to the bike shop to get some road shoes and clipless pedals. </p>

<p>But I guess from the beginning I have always been attracted to the simplicity of riding flat pedals. Before going out and purchasing the Race Face Chester for myself. I did heaps of research as you do. And I decided these sound great and I decided to give them a go. I have been on a number of shorter bikepacking trips with them. Up and over steep gravel inclines and speeding down fast, windy roads. And after my time pedalling with these I am very impressed!</p>



<p>I went with the simple black color, but you get the option to choose from about 7 different colors. They are made from a Nylon composite and some will say not ideal and as strong as some alloy pedals. With a Slim, lightweight platform with a concave shape. The pedals are made from a durable sealed chromoly steel axle with serviceable internals. I have striked the ground a couple times and seem to be fine. The claimed weight of the pedals is 12 ounces or 340 grams. </p>

<p>Before buying them I was a little concerned with the platform size and had my doubts. But they are the perfect size for my feet. The platform size offers about 110 mm X 101 mm of area for your feet to sit. And depending what part of the pedal the width varies from 15 to 18.4 mm. </p>



<p>In the past I have had problems with pedals flipping around too much in the past. These are very solid, in that they don&#8217;t spin around alot. If you try and spin them with your hand it barely makes a full rotation before stopping. Which helps for that extra confidence. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4830.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5829" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4830.jpg?w=5472&amp;ssl=1 5472w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4830.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4830.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4830.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4830.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4830.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4830.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Whether you are using these for commuting or backcountry adventures, the studs grip well into just about any shoe. The 8 serviceable and changeable pins that come with the pedals are large enough to really get a good grip with your shoes. They sit about 4 to 5 mm out from the surface of the pedals. Which is something that I like about these pedals compared to some <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-13-gravel-bike-pedals-2019-flat-and-clipless-pedals-for-gravel-bikes/">other gravel bike pedals.</a> Which have pins that only protrude out 1 to 2 mm.</p>



<p>They work best with shoes made with softer rubber soles then the harder rubber. But if you choose these pedals avoid wearing those shoes made from the newer foam soles as these pedals will eat them for breakfast! </p>

<p>I have noticed however that the pins on these Chester pedals to rust quickly. It could just be a surface rust thing. But I have been a a few bikepacking trips with these. But where I go is muddy and wet. Especially when testing it is winter and the bike was wet overnight, which would have played a part. But something to consider, it has not affected the function in anyway though. </p>

<p>However the grip is phenomenal. Once your foot is on it’s not moving. This can also be a bit of a downside to these pedals as well as a pro. It is rather difficult at times to adjust and move your foots positioning due to how well they grip. But if you want the pins are adjustable for bite. </p>



<p>These pedals offers great performance for a wide range of riders, especially those looking to adventure the gravel. While not being expensive, they are a value for money option at $49.95 <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F163803%2Frace-face-chester-pedals">here at REI</a>. </p>

<p>But before you commit and buy them you may want to consider some reasons to maybe not choose these pedals. Before I give you some cons to these pedals, the positives of the lightweight, price and durability out weight them for me. </p>



<p>The pin on these pedals are great and stick out a far way which is great for gripping your feet. But not so great when you gash your shin on them. They are sharp! </p>



<p>Also if you want to keep your shoes in a great condition. These might not be for you. As they grip so well to your shoe they will over time they might start to tear up the soles of your shoes, depending on the type of shoes you have. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4835.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5833" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4835.jpg?w=5472&amp;ssl=1 5472w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4835.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4835.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4835.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4835.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4835.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4835.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>You can have confidence that this is a quality pedal that is also under $50. As you get the options like you would with more expensive pedals. When it comes to being fully serviceable. You can by a replaceable pin kit, spindle replacement kit and a rebuild kit for these pedals. So if anything does go wrong or wears down over time you can fix and upgrade without going out and buying a whole new set of pedals. </p>



<p>Another good thing is that the pedals are a coloured plastic so when you scrape one it doesn&#8217;t show, so the abrasion is the same color as the pedal surface. </p>

<p>Overall if you are looking for a budget friendly and overall value for money gravel bike pedal. I highly recommend these. They have been holding up very well. The thin profile of the pedals do a good job avoiding scraping mst of the time, but even when you do knock them on rocks they do a great job at dampening vibrations, not like some metal pedals. </p>



<p>They have the confidence of many of mounter bikers and gravel grinders alike. As they are super popular, with some very great overall product reviews you cannot go wrong with these pedals. When it comes to performance, durability and price it is the perfect balance! Riders who have used them for over a year, say they needed virtually no maintenance, just some grease. While you can expect to break some pins here and there, they are easy to replace. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re on the fence and still undecided, you should just buy these pedals to try them out for yourself. Durability and performance is too high to pass these up <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F163803%2Frace-face-chester-pedals">at a price and weight this low.</a> Plus you get all the colors to match your rig! </p>
