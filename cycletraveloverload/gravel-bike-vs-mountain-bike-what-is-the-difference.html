<p>Let&#8217;s explore the key differences between the newly popular Gravel bike and the time old Mountain bike. Is there a difference? What is the difference? Which one should I get?</p>



<p>To get a simple answer the clue is in their names. Gravel bikes are just that, they are good on gravel and tow paths. They can handle tougher terrain than a Road bike but will struggle on the really down right dirty stuff and could potentially see you sliding off the track. Mountain bikes are good for tougher terrain, and, you guessed it, mountains! Mountain bikes lose speed on the smooth flatter terrain, whereas the Gravel bike can pick up some pace.</p>



<p>So now we’ve covered the basics, let’s explore each one a bit deeper. Why do they thrive in different environments? Which one is right for you?</p>



<h2><strong>What Is A Gravel Bike?</strong></h2>

<p>Let’s analyse the Gravel bikes in more detail. They’re real all rounders. They sit on a sliding scale between Road bikes and Mountain bikes. These hybrids can open up a world of adventure that your Road bike can’t take you to and can speed through urban areas that your Mountain bike will dawdle through. They’re for commuting in the week and exploring at the weekends. They’re for those rides where you’re not sure where you’ll end up. They come in all shapes and sizes and their differences are only growing as brands stretch the limits of what is classed a Gravel bike. As the market matures, bike lovers can choose bespoke options that lean towards a Road or Mountain bike preference, as well as other features that perhaps wouldn’t be possible on pure breeds.</p>



<h3><strong>Understanding Generic Gravel Bike Geometry&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="437" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/framegeo.png?resize=720%2C437&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5797" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/framegeo.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/framegeo.png?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/framegeo.png?resize=768%2C466&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/framegeo.png?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>In general, Gravel bikes have longer wheelbases than Road bikes. This gives them more comfort and stability over longer distances on unpredictable surfaces. Also, this makes them a good choice as a touring bike. Their head angle fits comfortably between Road and Mountain positions, which generally makes the steering less ‘twitchy’ than a Road bike but less accurate on muddy cyclo-cross tracks. They can utilise fatter tyres than a Road bike for more grip and comfort, whilst also having the option to take slimmer tyres than a Mountain bike for more speed. Typically their core frame has a sloped top tube and taller head tube allowing for greater comfort and ‘get go’. All Gravel bikes tend to come with disc brakes, giving you more space for bigger tyres and greater confidence when riding off-road.</p>



<h3><strong>Smoother Riding With A Gravel Bike</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/family_inspiration_grail_wmn_2019.jpg?resize=720%2C405&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5796" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/family_inspiration_grail_wmn_2019.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/family_inspiration_grail_wmn_2019.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/family_inspiration_grail_wmn_2019.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/family_inspiration_grail_wmn_2019.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/family_inspiration_grail_wmn_2019.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you’re going to be using your Gravel bike for smoother gravel surfaces and commuting, you need to focus on the features shared with their Road bike cousins. They tend to have narrow dropped bars for quicker and slicker manoeuvring, smaller head angles so you’re bent over more but less stable, 2x drive trains for more subtle gear shifts and thinner tyres to speed over smoother surfaces. This style will be speedy and have swift directional change on the smoother surfaces but be more unstable so will struggle on the tougher terrain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think about how you will <em>really </em>be using the bike and what your riding ability is. If you get a slim tyred roadster gravel bike and then go extreme off-roading<em> </em>you will likely lose control and the ride won’t be comfortable. The 2x drive trains aren’t ideal for quick sudden changes of speed to get up down and up those mountain trails, the last thing you need is getting stuck or having to shift through excessively when you’re trying to power round the fun bits!</p>



<h3><strong>Rough Riding With A Gravel Bike</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4414-3.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5799" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4414-3.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4414-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4414-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4414-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4414-3.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_4414-3.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>If you want to go exploring off-road on your Gravel bike you need to look at the chunkier end of the spectrum. These will have mountain bike features like wide flat bars for more stability, larger head angles so you’re more upright and in control, 1x drive trains to switch quickly with your terrain and thick grippy tyres so you can tackle the muddiest trails. This end of the scale gives you great stability and allows you to switch up your speed for the quickly changing terrain but will be slower and more cumbersome on smoother tracks. They will power through the mud and be a lot more comfortable over the bumps. This end of the Gravel bike scale doesn’t quite match up to a pure blood Mountain bike due to its hybrid nature. They tend to be more rigid and heavier handling than a true Mountain bike, but if you’re mixing terrains up then a Gravel might be the way to go.</p>



<h3><strong>What Tyres Does A Gravel Bike Take?</strong></h3>



<p>When thinking about what tyres to have, again, you need to think about what you will be using your bike for. If you want to mix and match your activities and terrains then look for a Gravel bike that has more clearance so you can swap a smaller wheel on with thicker tyres for those dirty days and a bigger wheel with thinner tyres for the commutes or smoother days. Most gravel bikes will be able to take the smaller 650b wheel to fit a fatter tyre on and the 700c wheel for most road tyres. This unique Gravel bike feature gives you the best of both worlds when it comes to choosing your rubber!</p>



<h2><strong>The Mountain Bike</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="467" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20_PEM_1_gallery_1.jpg?resize=720%2C467&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5800" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20_PEM_1_gallery_1.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20_PEM_1_gallery_1.jpg?resize=300%2C195&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20_PEM_1_gallery_1.jpg?resize=768%2C498&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20_PEM_1_gallery_1.jpg?resize=1024%2C665&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20_PEM_1_gallery_1.jpg?resize=50%2C32&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20_PEM_1_gallery_1.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This is an umbrella term for any bike made for being truly off-road. They differ just as much as Gravel bikes do. So how are we supposed to decide? You will find the answer again in asking yourself what you are using your bike for. They come with or without suspension, different wheel and tyre sizes. The general rule is: more complex suspension for more complex tracks. Less suspension and harder feel for the smoother easier tracks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are going to be riding tough jumpy terrain you will need to look at dual, or full, suspension mountain bikes. The suspension increases contact time allowing for more grip and control through muddy jumps. These same jumps would be very unforgiving on a Gravel bike without the benefits of suspension.</p>



<p>If you’ll be on generally smoother tracks with a few fun bits then maybe try looking into the more affordable ‘hardtails’. They only have suspension on the front forks and a rigid, ‘hard’, rear or ‘tail’. This makes them lighter and faster on smoother surfaces but also able to cushion some bumps along the way. You can lock the front suspension out for a fully rigid frame if you’re riding on smooth surfaces so all your energy can go into propulsion rather than being absorbed.</p>



<p>The final category is the fully rigid mountain bike, probably the closest to a Gravel bike you will get. They are lighter weight and less technical than their bouncy brothers. This limits them to easier terrain, often a great starter bike.</p>



<h3><strong>Which Bike Is Best For Touring Or Bike Packing?</strong></h3>



<p>This is where the Gravel bikes true versatility comes into play. It has been given extra eyelets to allow for attaching front and rear racks for touring, something the Mountain bike generally cannot take. Whilst touring you will often be on sealed and gravel surfaces, something the Gravel bike will thrive on. If you’re going for a short exciting bikepacking adventure which may take you through some off-road trails you could take your Mountain bike but you’d lose speed and exert more effort when you come back to civilisation, so again, I’d probably still take a Gravel bike unless there’s a lot of powder or mud involved!</p>



<h3><strong>The Key Differences Between Mountain Bike and Gravel Bike</strong></h3>



<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><br></td><td><strong>Mountain Bike</strong></td><td><strong>Gravel Bike</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Speed</strong></td><td>Wide fat tyres and suspension that limits top speed on smooth surfaces but will dance around muddy tracks.</td><td>Slimmer hybrid tyres and rigid frame that allows for faster speeds on smooth surfaces but will struggle in the mud.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Terrain</strong></td><td>Best performing on muddy, rocky trails with capability for quick speed and angle changes. Mountain bikes with suspension can make off-road trails easier to ride.&nbsp;</td><td>Capable on smoother surfaces and can handle moderately rocky off-road terrains, but inappropriate for more extreme trails.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Stability</strong></td><td>Upright head position, wide handlebar grip position, suspension and frames designed for a more stable position and easier handling.</td><td>Rigid frame design, narrower handlebars and a smaller head angle makes them less stable on the rough but the longer wheelbase gives more stability for longer unpredictable rides.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Touring</strong></td><td>Not equipped for long distance touring but could be taken for more adventurous bikepacking weekends.</td><td>Well equipped for handling longer distances with front and rear packs with a good level of comfort.</td></tr></tbody></table>



<h3><strong>So which bike should I buy?</strong></h3>



<p>After considering everything above; terrain, ability, usage and speed, I think the final thing to look at is budget. The suspension added to mountain bikes can really ramp up their cost, cheap full suspension Mountain bikes come in at around $1500 with it being easy to spend a lot more for the top end technical models. Whereas cheap Gravel bikes can be found for under $1000 with fewer differences being found if you spend a lot more.</p>



<p>In conclusion, if you’re really into getting down right muddy and battling treacherous terrains at the weekends then you should have a decent mountain bike with some level of suspension. However, if you’re going out for a nice Sunday ride that might take you through some tougher trails then the Gravel bike can flourish. Gravel bikes are also better suited to long distance bike touring adventures, helping you cover moderate terrain with added comfort for the extra kilometres. </p>
