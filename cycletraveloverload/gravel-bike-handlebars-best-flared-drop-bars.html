<p>For a while I have been using standard road bars on my Surly LHT that I have been building out. But as I got more and more interested in taking it out on wilderness trails I realised I needed handlebars that provided more comfort over the rough stuff. This let me to gravel bike handlebars and the flared drop bars. And lets face it they make you bike look so much more badass! That flare angle on the drops with some nice gravel tires just sing &#8220;take me on a adventure!&#8221; But what makes these handlebars better for this type of off-road riding? And what are somethings to keep in mind before going out and buying some flared drop bars for your bike? First here is a quick look at the best flared drop bar options.</p>

<p>Well first of all apart from the aesthetics, flared drop bars serve a really great purpose, especially for gravel grinding. The main thing I noticed on my first ride with my FUNN G-Wide 50mm handlebars was the comfort. Compared to road handlebars that extra width of handlebar provides without a doubt much more flexibility in the bar reducing vibrations on your wrists. The shape and design of my specific handlebars put me in a really comfortable upright riding position. That was one of the problems I had with the road bars. I would get a sore back after a week of touring as the positioning was to forward. The hoods sit slightly higher too. The drops are also really comfortable you are able to stretch out your arms fully.</p>



<p>Another beneficial reason to try them out is the flare! It results in better manoeuvrability allowing for better control when you need it to dodge big rocks and sticks. Once going to flared bars I don&#8217;t think I will every go bar to standard road drop bars ever again. I shopped around and found the FUNN bars as the cheapest flare bar option. If you are interested I cover more on them down below with some other flared options. But for only $99 they are a great choice and I highly recommend. </p>



<p>There is so many other positives about flared drop bars that I could go on and on. But I am sure you want to find out more about the best flared drop bars. Anyway I will be quick! Yes, you do get heaps of hand positions which is critical for extended bike adventures to move around and prevent any pains. As the nature of the bars are so wide you get heaps of room for mounting gadgets. While also fitting just about any handlebar bags you desire. </p>



<p>If you are sold on the idea of gravel handlebars like I am. You should note that they are wide and if you are in a city and pan to ride between traffic it might be a bit hard. I have not tested them out in the city yet. Also when leaning your bike on a wall or something with flared bars they don&#8217;t quiet sit well. But they are made for the gravel!</p>



<p>Okay now the list of the best flared drop bars! I asked a bunch of gravel grinders what they use on their bikes and below is the look at some of the best gravel handlebars that money can buy! First is the bars I have been using, and again I am surprised with how well they have performed!</p>



<h2>FUNN G-Wide Handlebars</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="146" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/funn-g-wide-gravel-black-500mm.jpg?resize=500%2C146&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3901" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/funn-g-wide-gravel-black-500mm.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/funn-g-wide-gravel-black-500mm.jpg?resize=300%2C88&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/funn-g-wide-gravel-black-500mm.jpg?resize=50%2C15&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://amzn.to/2rXVGZR">Shop Amazon</a></div>



<p>It makes sense to get these bars in the longer 500 mm, compared to the same priced 480 mm. Only cause you get more bar for your buck. But it is personal preference, I love how wise they are.</p>



<p>They are originally designed for hardcore gravel riding. Made with a heat treated, triple butted high grade 6069 alloy. With a 31.8 mm clamp diameter. With a 6° back sweep, 25° flare. The width of the bar offers very generous luggage spaces, making them perfect for long bike tours.</p>



<p>When I initially got these drops I was really surprised by how long the reach is and how deep the drops are. Very different from a short and shallow standard road drop bar. It may be a good idea to ride a shorter stem.</p>



<h2>Zipp Service Course SL 70 XPLR</h2>

<p>The Zipp Service Course SL 70 XPLR at 46 wide. Have 5 degree flare, but 11 degree out sweep. This gives you shallow drop, some outsweep (many call flare), but your hoods remain relatively forward facing instead of tilted, for better brake hood positioning. Flat tops too, with a little backsweep. You can ride these bars on many services from paved roads onto gravel, mud, dirt, and even single track. The flare is 20 degrees less then the G-wides these would be best if you want a handlebar that as some flare but not to much. </p>



<h2>Salsa Cowchippers</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="187" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/salsa-salsa-bend-bar-copy-243394-1-1.jpg?resize=600%2C187&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3909" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/salsa-salsa-bend-bar-copy-243394-1-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/salsa-salsa-bend-bar-copy-243394-1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/salsa-salsa-bend-bar-copy-243394-1-1.jpg?resize=50%2C16&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=92594cfb-2b30-40ba-ab76-f9c20ed4612c&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fsalsa-cowchipper-drop-handlebar">Shop Competitive Cyclist</a></div>



<p>These are the handlebars I was looking at along with the FUNN Bars. The reason for getting the other bars was availability for me here in Australia and Price. But these handlebars are very popular with other gravel grinders that I asked with around 50% of them having these bars! The Cowchipper provides comfort, control, and efficiency for long days in the saddle, whether road touring, crushing mixed surfaces, or conquering the Great Divide. </p>



<p>While the Cowchipper retains some resemblance of a traditional road bar, its radical 24° flare in the drops boosts leverage, stability, and comfort dramatically.</p>



<h2>Ritchey Venturemax</h2>

<p>These Venturemax handlebars are another flared bar option for a gravel bike setup. They do have quiet a odd shape if I was to be honest. However they say not to worry about that. It features a bio-bend design that is intended to ride wider than typical drop bars and provides multiple hand positions for increased comfort and control. The VentureMax is just as applicable on a cross country tour as on cross country singletrack. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s definitely a unique look and feel to this bar. On the drops you can notice a slight disfiguration in the bar, which acts as a placements for your hands when in the drops. </p>



<h2>FSA Adventure</h2>

<p>Full Speed Ahead make these Adventure handlebars. They are the cheapest option in the article at only $39.99. Coming in a 420 mm or 440 mm width option. However they do have a smaller flared angle then some other handlebar option here. </p>



<h2>Velo Orange (Dajia Cycleworks) Far Bars</h2>

<p>Finally we have Velo Orange, they make some great gear! Their Far Bars are no exception. They are fantastic, lightweight off-road touring bar designed to be used with road components. Unlike dirt drops of years past, these allow you to have a normal hood position in addition to an easy reach to the brake levers from the drops. These bars are compatible with bar-end shifters as well as integrated shifters. The Far Bars have a 21 degrees of flare, drop of 110 mm, and reach of 76 mm.</p>
