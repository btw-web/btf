<p>They are one of the best solutions for a commuter! The good old touring bike. They have not really even been in fashion. For a trendy urban cyclists lets say! They serve more of a purpose then good aesthetics. And this is why they are more preferred for commuting and are popular in urban areas. Walking around the streets of Melbourne I see so many touring bikes locked up and you just know that they are being used as commuters and why not?</p>



<p>I have met so many bike tourers and just general bikers who have touring bikes that they use for commuting. They are the best answer! A great type of bike for the job. But why are they a choice for bike commuters? What makes them so popular? </p>



<p><strong>Stealth</strong> &#8211; Possibly less attractive to thieves and probable less likely to be stolen, because lets face it they are not the most good looking bikes out there. </p>

<p><strong>Luggage/Gear Carrying Potential</strong> &#8211; Real touring bikes are designed to carry a heap of gear for long bike tours that can span the length of the globe. Built with a longer chain-stay to accommodate rear panniers. Longer wheelbase and often a lower BB drop for better centre of gravity when the bike is under a heavier load. Great touring bikes come with rear and front racks for attaching panniers for storing the groceries or work essentials. </p>

<p><strong>Relaxed Geometry and Riding Comfort &#8211;</strong> The traditional use of a touring bike meant heading off on some very long and strenuous bike expeditions. Meaning you are on the bike day in and day out for day, week, months and even years on end. You need a bike that is designed to make you as comfortable as possible. </p>



<p>A touring bikes geometry as mentioned before is more relaxed and generally more upright when comparing to something like a road bike. When you are commuting you are generally not really in a rush and that added comfort is always a bonus while riding, so it makes sense. Some touring bikes have butterfly bars or trekking bars which in my own opinion are more comfortable then standard drop bars but most touring bike come with drop bars. </p>



<p>Compared to flat bar commuter bikes they offer so much comfort and a variety of hand positions which means you can move around your hands and adjust when you need. </p>

<p><strong>Reliability</strong> &#8211; This goes for many aspects of a touring bike. But for example the brakes are strong and most parts all together are reliable and can be trusted. If you get yourself a nice well built touring bike you can trust everything about it. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-9.jpeg?resize=720%2C405&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4161" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-9.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-9.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-9.jpeg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Tyre Width Potential &#8211;</strong> Most touring bikes allow for wider tires. For example my Surly Long Haul Trucker allows me to fit 45 mm tires on it. This is rather wide for commuting especially in urban areas. but if you are commuting near off-road terrain this is perfect. If you ride a road bike, some yes, can be fitted with wider tyres but you are limited. It just make sense to have a touring bike that allows for wider tires as this is ideal when negotiating tramway tracks in the city when your bike is loaded. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="378" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-8.jpeg?resize=720%2C378&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4160" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-8.jpeg?w=764&amp;ssl=1 764w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-8.jpeg?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-8.jpeg?resize=50%2C26&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>CyclingAbout.com</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Gearing &#8211;</strong> One of the great things about a touring bike is the gearing ratio on them. They need to provide enough gears for those really steep section when you are climbing and the bike is fully loaded with gear on a bike tour. Same goes for climbing a hill with a bike full of groceries, those lower gears will come in handy. </p>



<p>Apart from using a touring bike as a commuter. You also get the option to use it how it was built to be ridden. This may open you up to the world of bike touring. In my own opinion it is one of the best ways to see the world. I recommend that everyone at least goes on one bike tour once in their life, it is a grand experience. But if you get a touring bike for a commuter then there is no need to go out and buy another bike for a tour if you wish to go explore the world. </p>



<h4><strong>Are road bikes good for commuting?</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="424" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-7.jpeg?resize=650%2C424&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4159" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-7.jpeg?w=650&amp;ssl=1 650w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-7.jpeg?resize=300%2C196&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-7.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Road bikes are a okay option. If a road bike is the only bike you own then yes it is fine. If you are looking to by a road bike for solely commuting you might want to thing about that a bit more.  There are not the best! Road bikes are generally more race oriented when you look at the geometry, meaning potentially less comfortable when commuting and you have limited carrying abilities on some road bikes. Some have no eyelets to mount racks and based on material some are not recommended to carry heavy loads. </p>



<h4>Can I use a mountain bike for commuting?</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="484" height="319" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-6.jpeg?resize=484%2C319&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4158" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-6.jpeg?w=484&amp;ssl=1 484w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-6.jpeg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/images-6.jpeg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Yes you can! I feel like Barack Obama right now! If you plan to ride really rough, mountain bike style terrain then go ahead. But again for city commuting? Maybe not! That is why I believe touring bikes are the answer to the ultimate commuter bicycle. They are essentially a combination of all these bikes in one bike. Touring bikes are good for some light off-road riding and are more then capable in tearing up the city streets. </p>



<p>If you are after some ideas on some touring bikes to look out for. That are great for commuting to work or down to the local shops, then check these 2020 models out. They are some of the best touring bike options out there. </p>

<p>You know what I get this question sometimes and I think this might even be a better option. Especially if your commute sees a lot of dirt and off-road riding. Gravel bikes are lightweight when compared to a traditional touring and they allow for carry gear just like a touring bike. Maybe not to the extend but you don&#8217;t need to cart that much stuff when you are commuting generally anyway. Typically if your commute is longer and rough a gravel bike is your better option. </p>
