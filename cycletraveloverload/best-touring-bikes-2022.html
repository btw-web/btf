<p>In this article we are going to see what that best 2022 touring bikes are! There has been huge advancement in the gravel scene and as bikepacking has taken the adventure cycling world by storm. It seems touring bikes are just humbly chilling in the background. </p>



<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong some <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-for-touring-6-best-gravel-bikes-for-touring/">gravel bikes make great touring bikes</a>. As you will see, some bikes that are technically gravel bikes have more features than some touring bikes do! Which is why I would recommend some gravel bikes over most traditional touring bikes if you are looking for a bike to not only ride on the roads but also the less travelled gravel roads.  </p>



<p>The touring bike has a special place in my heart. As it it was the type of bicycle that opened the doors to this wonderful world of adventuring by bike. </p>



<p><em>These bikes are considered the best bicycles for long distance touring. Meaning more traditional touring mainly on paved roads. Although you can ride gravel if needed there are other bike options for this, see link above about gravel bikes for touring. </em></p>



<p>Most are all new 2022 models and are great for loading up and riding for months on end to cover states and even countries at a time. Some are better for lightweight, credit card style of touring, others are best for fully loaded front and rear pannier setups. </p>



<p>But why these ones? All bikes went through certain criteria to make sure they are capable touring bikes. </p>



<p>Normally material has been important for me. But you will notice that there is a variety of carbon, aluminium to steel. I prefer steel personally,  but alloy and carbon are still good options for lighter touring. </p>



<p>Also gear ratio and the range of gears needs to be wide. A comfortable climbing gear not so much highest gear for downhill. But when the bike is loaded you need a low climbing gear or granny gear. Ideally under 20&#8243; to 25&#8243; for a touring bike. For lighter touring 25&#8243; is acceptable but if you wish to ride fully loaded the smaller the climbing gear the better. </p>



<p>Weight is important to some people, typically when touring you are carry gear and a few kgs here and there doesn&#8217;t matter so much. But if you want to go light touring and bikepacking. Opting for a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/the-lightest-touring-bike-carbon-touring-bikes/">carbon touring bike</a> might be worth it. But it is recommended to use such bikes for lighter touring. </p>



<p>It is debatable when it comes to brakes, either; hydraulic or mechanical. Some say mechanical brakes as it is easier to repair in foreign countries. But I am a fan of hydraulic and how powerful they work. </p>



<p>When it comes to wheels and other components the stronger the better, for a touring bike they often come with 36 spokes or 36 holes for spokes. Most bikes here have no less then 32. Also ideally already come with racks, either front or rear or both. </p>



<p>Touring bike geometry is lastly one of the most important aspects when choosing a bike. </p>



<ul><li>Having an upright riding position is pivotable for all day comfort while riding. Having a stack/reach ratio around 1.5 or up is best! </li><li>Long wheelbase around 1040 mm or so depending on size. </li><li>Chainstay around 445 mm or more is ideal for clearance to run rear rack and panniers. This means a rather chill or stable feel in the rear for carry panniers. </li><li>Front centre over 600 mm is also not bad, this means more clearance to run front panniers if you wish. </li><li>Trail around 60 mm to 70 mm will mean the bike feels predictable and stable in the front. </li></ul>



<p>It is important to note that all bikes are different and will fluctuate. But I only included bikes that fit this rough criteria. </p>



<h2>2022 Kona Sutra SE</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="418" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_se.jpeg?resize=720%2C418&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-8009" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_se.jpeg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_se.jpeg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_se.jpeg?resize=768%2C445&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sutra_se.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>I personally have the Sutra LTD 2020, which is the same frame but with a 1x gravel drivetrain. This touring bike has much better range of gearing, and it comes stock with a Brooks saddle! I have fit up to 29×2.3″ tires without fenders, on my LTD. So technically you could go a bit wider than the standard 700x40c Schwalbe Marathon Mondial tires. Which is some of the best clearance I have seen for a touring bike that is in this list. So still capable for off-road riding, road touring and even bikepacking down single track (with ample width tires). </p>



<p>With 3 x 10 Deore groupset, mechanical disc brakes, MicroShift bar-end shifters and the Shimano Deore, 26/36/48t crank &amp; Shimano Deore 11-36t cassette. The bike has a 19.90&#8243; granny gear and 120.50&#8243; highest gear. That&#8217;s a 0.72 to 4.36 gear ratio. Priced at $1,799</p>



<p>The design of the frame give you an upright 1.56 stack/reach ratio, 638 mm front centre, 445 mm chainstay, 1,073 mm wheelbase and 71 mm trail. (For a 54 cm frame).</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1109" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/520Allroad_21_33474_A_Primary-1.jpeg?fit=720%2C416&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6732" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/520Allroad_21_33474_A_Primary-1.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/520Allroad_21_33474_A_Primary-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/520Allroad_21_33474_A_Primary-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C444&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/520Allroad_21_33474_A_Primary-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C591&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/520Allroad_21_33474_A_Primary-1.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/520Allroad_21_33474_A_Primary-1.jpeg?resize=346%2C200&amp;ssl=1 346w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/520Allroad_21_33474_A_Primary-1.jpeg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>Steming from the Trek 520 the Grando is more suited for light touring or even bikepacking, whatever you want to call it! It&#8217;s all the same really. Compared to the Trek 520 Disc it is 900 grams lighter. So defendly more suited to those looking to pack an under 10 kg gear setup. Still has the same Trek butted chromoly frame and Alloy fork. </p>



<p>It comes with a different saddle and pretty much everything else is the same. Then you have the 2 x 10 GRX 400, Tiagra groupset. And slightly wider tires, 700c x 40. </p>



<p>Trek say that this &#8220;steel adventure bike made for off-road excursions. This &#8220;gravel randonneuring&#8221; bike&#8217;s nimble, streamlined setup and rugged parts spec is perfect for bikepacking and gravel riding.&#8221;</p>



<p>The geometry of this bike has a stack/reach ratio of 1.49, 608 mm front centre, 450 mm chainstay length, 1,048 wheelbase, and 65 mm trail. </p>



<p>The 42/28 T crank and 11-36T cassette, gives the bike a 21.56″ climbing gear&nbsp;and&nbsp;105.58″ highest gear. So this means when riding downhill at 90 RPM you should hit around 45.5 kph or 28.3 mph. Giving the bike a 0.78 to 3.82 gear ratio. Priced for the same $1,829.99</p>

<p>Rolling on some 700c x 50 tires for extra suppleness, and a lightweight ALUXX SLR aluminium frame with smooth-handling composite fork work together to take the edge off bumpy roads and trails. A flat bar option if that is more your style.</p>



<p>With a decent gear range with a 21.60&#8243; climbing gear and 113.70&#8243; highest gear, with a 0.76 to 4.0 gear ratio. </p>



<p>The geometry of this rig is a little less upright then most here with the 1.46 stack/reach ratio, however the flat bars in theory put you more upright. With a 450 mm chainstay, 1078 mm wheelbase, and a much higher 78.3 mm trail that might even be sluggish. But it does come with front and rear racks all you need to do is pick a spot on the map and go! Priced at $1,349</p>
