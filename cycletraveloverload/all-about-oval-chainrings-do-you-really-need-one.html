<p>Growing in popularity is the oval chainring or also known as elliptical chainrings. Are oval chainrings really worth it? Well I am going to guide you through and hopefully help you understand what it is that has captivated the people who dig this design of chainring.</p>



<p>The whole benefit and idea behind oval chainrings is that it can optimise your pedal stroke in the way the ring is shaped, which allows you to then pedal little easier when you are in the non-optimal part of your pedal stroke. On of the things worth noting right away if if you have a big mechanical issue and you need to run single speed the tension and slack of the chain will move around too much and not work for a single speed setup. </p>



<p>If you have a Sram Apex setup and want to run a lower crank then 40T for whatever reason you cannot go sub 40 on Apex. Only with the Absolute Black 38t chainring you are able to fit on the bike and have a lower tooth count. </p>



<p>The design of oval chainrings are said to have your work less when pedalling which will save you more energy to keep going. The goal with these chainrings is to eliminate the uneven pedal stroke you may feel with a normal round chainring and also help reduce the amount of shifting you experience when you get tired after long days in the saddle and climbing. </p>



<h2>Oval Chainring Pros And Cons</h2>



<p>There are some great benefits for choosing oval chainrings over the normal round ones. But what are they you might be asking?</p>



<ul><li>Greater pedalling efficiency. As seen above it makes sense in theory when it comes to saving your limited power output and instead based on product design allowing you to make the most of your energy to pedal more efficiently. </li><li>A smoother delivery of power or torque to the rear wheel. A round chainring results in a uneven pedal stroke which means your cadence becomes jerky and irregular. Surprisingly a oval chainring smooths this out. Which also increases you overall traction thanks to the the increased torque. </li></ul>



<h3>Oval Chainring Knee Pain And Other Cons</h3>



<p>Yes this is one of the main cons or down sides that some people have experienced when using oval chainrings, knee pain! There could be a possible whiplash effect problem resulting in bad knees. Everyone is different and this might not be a problem for you. But some people have had some issues.</p>



<p>Furthermore there have also been some issues with the chain drop being potentially higher. And some say again that they are not recommended with singlespeeds. And also some say they feel weird to begin with and this could be a feeling that you might not never get over. Personally if these oval cahinrings have you interested at all it might be worth trying them out to see how they work for you. The benefits of efficiency might be worth it, especially for long days in the saddle. </p>



<h2 style="text-align:left">Best Oval Chainrings</h2>



<p>When looking at the oval chainring options available on the market. Each one serves a different purpose and benefits. Let me explain product by product. Then after we will answer some common questions and dive deeper into the pros and cons of Oval chainrings to normal round chainrings. </p>



<h3>Absolute Black Oval Chainring</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/614fPQGWrBL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=382%2C337&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5264" width="382" height="337" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/614fPQGWrBL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/614fPQGWrBL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=300%2C265&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/614fPQGWrBL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=768%2C678&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/614fPQGWrBL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=1024%2C905&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/614fPQGWrBL._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=50%2C44&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>As they suggest these oval chainrings don&#8217;t produce more power but they &#8220;allow you to unleash your true potential.&#8221; The chainring optimises the pedalling torque you generate, reducing your effort on the climbs and increasing your speed at the same time increasing your efficiency and power. All Absolute Black chainrings are compatible with 10 and 11 speed drivetrains. </p>



<p>If energy saving is a priority for you this is the main reason to consider these unique chainrings. In particular the Absolute Black are said with the same energy output with a round chainring you will consume less energy. Thanks to studies that they undertook where they found that their oval chainring produced up to 9% increase of Force effectiveness, up to 7% less oxygen consumption, up to 15% less Ventilation (breathing) and up to 10% heart rate decrease when using oval chainrings versus round. Even though some mention these types of chainrings are not ideal for singlespeed. Absolute Black still recommends that they are &#8220;perfect for Singlespeed use as well&#8221;. <a href="https://amzn.to/3bNMpoO">Prices start from $67.49</a></p>



<p>When climbing specifically this ring gives you more power to the wheel and is much smoother, and overall effort is put to the wheel way more efficiently. It honestly felt faster / easier to accelerate, and maintain a higher speed. These oval chainrings but Absolute Black are some of the best around, high quality, light, and the fit/finish is top notch!</p>



<h3>Wolf Tooth Elliptical Chainring</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/71rs2FEiWcL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=400%2C365&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5262" width="400" height="365" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/71rs2FEiWcL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?w=915&amp;ssl=1 915w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/71rs2FEiWcL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=300%2C274&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/71rs2FEiWcL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C701&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/71rs2FEiWcL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=50%2C46&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Wolf Tooth Elliptical prides itself on being less aggressive then some of the other rings in this article. As this chainring is &#8221; a less ovalized ring&#8221;, combating against uneven pedal strokes the chainring results in a more smooth ride. While also providing power, better traction and less shifting. And they even claim that you will not feel that much of a difference or any to your current round chainring. </p>



<p>I was rather sceptical like many when first finding out about these oval chainrings. But as you can see with the animation below. When you are in the &#8216;power zone&#8217; this 34T example feels like a 36T on the way pedalling down and pulling back up. But during the &#8216;recovery zone&#8217; at the top and bottom points of the pedal stroke, it feels like a 32T</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PowerTrac-Animation_300_1.gif?resize=345%2C345&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5261" width="345" height="345" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The PowerTrac Elliptical rings feature <strong>10% ovality, combined with 112° timing</strong>, which is measured after the Top Dead Center (TDC). This means that with PTE rings, the larger-diameter section of the ring engages with the chain at the optimal point on the downstroke, or “Power Zone,” to take advantage of your body’s natural biomechanics. <a href="https://amzn.to/39L5LJM">From $48.00</a> Please note that there are a large number of different chainrings for different bikes. The ones I have included here are best for a gravel bike SRAM setup. </p>



<h3>SRAM Eagle X-Sync 2 Oval Chainring</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61-Xk3PrS-L._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=365%2C412&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5263" width="365" height="412" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61-Xk3PrS-L._AC_SL1200_.jpg?w=838&amp;ssl=1 838w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61-Xk3PrS-L._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=265%2C300&amp;ssl=1 265w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61-Xk3PrS-L._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=768%2C868&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/61-Xk3PrS-L._AC_SL1200_.jpg?resize=44%2C50&amp;ssl=1 44w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>All these three different Oval Chainring brands are the main players in this space. Which leads me on to SRAMS own version of the oval chainring. Studies of chainring wear patterns led to the radical tooth profile that is said to last longer, runs quieter and further improves chain retention. These are the only oval chainrings with X-Sync 2 tooth design. <a href="https://amzn.to/3aJ1mZc">Price for the SRAM Chainring runs in at $119.00</a></p>



<h3>Are Oval Chainrings Better? And Do They Make A Difference?</h3>



<p>I am going to leave this up to studies and expert opinion if you want some more reading about oval chainrings and how well they perform and how they physically effect the rider. Below you will find a couple links to more information. </p>
