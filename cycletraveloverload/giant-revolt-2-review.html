<p>This Giant Revolt is a lightweight gravel bike that is built for gravel riding. I did some research and could not find exact numbers, however it weighs around the 10kg mark. Yes, you can go off-road adventuring on this bike. But right off the bat it must be mentioned that there are better gravel bike adventure bikes out there. This bike seems more suited to gravel racing and more fast pasted riding, then epic, and extended bike explorations. </p>

<p>If you are looking for a budget friendly and maybe your first bike in this wonderful world of gravel bikes then this could be a good fit for you. Not as pricey as some of the better bikes on the market this could be a great choice for just getting started. </p>



<p>Wether you plan to ride dirt roads, trails, gravel, or a mix of everything. If you are looking for a bike that floats right through these conditions, keeps you in control, and is comfortable for long days in the saddle, then the Revolt is a nice bike for that. The bike features a lightweight ALUXX aluminium frame and composite fork, each engineered to balance stiffness (for efficiency) and compliance (for comfort and control). Also including additions which help for better comfort on the rough stuff. It comes with integrated components including the D-Fuse seatpost and Contact XR D-Fuse handlebar to further absorb road shocks and vibrations. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1098" height="618" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bi001438-metallic-black.jpg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4556" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bi001438-metallic-black.jpg?w=1098&amp;ssl=1 1098w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bi001438-metallic-black.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bi001438-metallic-black.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bi001438-metallic-black.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bi001438-metallic-black.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>Also the frame is integrated for disc brakes and it has clearance for larger tyres up to 45c. It does comes with a number of built-in features including the X-Defender downtube protector and smart-mount system for racks and accessories. </p>



<p>This is a rather good bike that made it into my list of the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/8-best-gravel-bikes-under-1500-budget-gravel-bikes/">best gravel bikes under $1500</a>. when really it could have made it in the $1000! But I guess that would mean it is not technically under $1000! right?</p>



<h2>Great Things About The Revolt 2</h2>



<ul><li>Depending on how you look at it but this bike does come with a D-fuse seatpost with its D shaped profile. Offering flex, which&nbsp;takes out the worst of the bumps and vibration, you aren&#8217;t getting bounced around in the saddle when you are at speed, making you more efficient.</li></ul>



<h2>Not So Great Things About Revolt 2</h2>



<ul><li>With the D-fuse seatpost it cannot be replaced with a aftermarket one as it is a unique shape. Which can be a downside if this is what you had planned. </li></ul>



<h2>Keep This In Mind</h2>



<ul><li>It only has one eyelet on the fork which is not ideal when it comes to mounting cargo cages for extra storage solutions. Not a deal breaker, you still could get around this with a front rack if you wanted more storage. </li></ul>



<h4>Frameset</h4>



<p>The frame is built from a ALUXX Grade Aluminum with disc brake mounting. The frame is designed to provide all-round versatility with a fast, smooth ride on variable surfaces. You also get a full composite, OverDrive steerer front carbon fork, which also helps to dampen road and trail vibrations. </p>



<h4>Components</h4>



<p>Starting with the breaks you do get Giant Conduct hydraulic disc brakes. You get a Giant Contact XR Ergo-Control, 31.8 handlebar which is said to be rather comfortable on long rides. Offering the damping of rough trails which is so need for a gravel bike. </p>



<h4>Drivetrain</h4>



<p>A average setup with the Shimano Sora drivetrain which is still rather good but again it is a $1000 bike so don&#8217;t expected the best. Making it a modest component level aluminum frame gravel bike. The bike is a 2&#215;9 speed which has Shimano CH-HG400, 11&#215;34 cassette and FSA Vero Pro, 32/48 crankset. </p>



<h4>Wheels</h4>



<p>This bike comes with Giant&#8217;s S-X2 Disc wheelset. The option to fit up to 45c tires and the bikes comes stock with the Giant Crosscut AT 2, 700&#215;38 tires. You might even be able to fit some <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/wtb-riddler-review-2500-km-on-these-gravel-tires/">WTB Riddlers</a> 45c on this rig. Giant Contact XR Ergo-Control, 31.8</p>



<h3>Geometry</h3>



<p>It seems the overall geometry and ride feel of this revolt is that similar to the the carbon Canyon Grail, which feel like racing bikes for rough surfaces and ride very fast and are fun. But lack the endurance geometry for long term comfort when riding for weeks at a time with bike bags and gear. Which for this blog at least is our thing, so this is a lose for this bike for the point. </p>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>To be honest when I was in the market for a new Giant back in the day I wish this was available for the same price as my Giant Defy (road bike) I could have gotten a bike that would be great for road as well as hitting the gravel. From my personal experience with Giant there bikes are some of the best for value. And for this bike specifically.</p>



<p>The shifting is buttery smooth, and the frame geometry gives me confidence on trails as well as steep descents. The response is great! For the price and performance it is one of the best gravel bikes you can buy! The perfect entry level gravel bike and maybe you will not even have a need to upgrade to a better one.</p>
