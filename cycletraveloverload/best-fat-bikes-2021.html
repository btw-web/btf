<p>I continue my search for a new fat bike as I write this article. I have been riding a gravel/adventure bike and touring bikes for some time. But have the urge to try something much more capable at getting me to those places where no other bike can go, except a fat bike. </p>



<p>As bike companies begin to release their 2021 model bikes. I thought it would be fun to see what 2021 fat bikes have just hit the market and see what bike brands are offering us for this new season. </p>



<p>Below is a list of most of the newest 2021 fat bikes I could find. I might be missing some, so please contact and let me know if I missed any other 2021 fat bikes. </p>



<p>This article was made to explore all the new models available and not all of these bikes I would buy, as some are rather heavy at 15Kg. But there is a fat bike here for everyone, for all budgets and adventures. Enjoy!</p>

<p>If you want to go all out and budget isn&#8217;t an issue. Then the 2021 Salsa Beargrease Carbon X01 Eagle might be the answer. It is a 27.5″ carbon frame rigid fat bike with ultra high-end components and hydraulic disc brakes. Everything about this bike speaks, amazement! The colors, to the groupset which is a 1 x 12 X01 Eagle, Truvativ Stylo Carbon. To the weight, which is lighter than most complete fat bikes. At 27.0 lbs / 12.3 kg, that&#8217;s lighter than my steel gravel/adventure bike! And the lightest in this list of 2021 fat bikes. If lightweight is high priority then you might want to check out this <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/carbon-fat-bikes-ultimate-list-of-the-lightest-fat-bikes/">Carbon Fat Bikes – Ultimate List Of The Lightest Fat Bikes</a> article. </p>



<p>The groupset gives you a nice large range, with the SRAM Carbon Stylo C Eagle DUB FAT5, 30t crank and the SRAM XG 1295 Eagle, 10–52t cassette. Rolling on some 45NRTH Vanhelga, 27.5 x 4.0&#8243; tires. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FSalsa-2021-Beargrease-Carbon-X01-Eagle-12-speed-Fat">Priced at $5999</a> (Salsa also have some more budget friendly 2021 Beargrease Carbon models available, more on those soon)</p>



<p>The thing I like about Salsa bikes is their attention to details for backcountry adventure when you need to take gear with you. This bikes also features the versatile frame and fork mounts to let you carry everything you need. That Kingpin fork features four sets of Three-Pack mounts. Just thinking of some wonderful snowy endurance races or adventures that could be done on this beast! Maybe just pack your camping gear and embark on a long-distance overnight bike trip.</p>

<p>If you like the Beargrease for a racing fat bike, they have some cheaper option like this Salsa Beargrease Carbon SLX, which is a 27.5″ carbon frame rigid fat bike with upper mid-range components. Or the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F183268%2Fsalsa-beargrease-carbon-deore-fat-bike">Deore</a> option which is cheaper again but more limited components. At $2,249.00</p>



<p>The SLX comes in at a reasonable 29.0 lbs / 13.2 kg. Featuring a 1 x 12 Shimano SLX groupset. Which means a Race Face Aeffect, 30t crank and Shimano SLX CS-M7100-12, 10–51t cassette. Which is 1 tooth less range than the X01 Eagle. You do get the same tires which are 45NRTH Vanhelga, 27.5 x 4.0&#8243;. But the rims are Sun Ringle SRC 15 x 150 mm hub, Mulefüt SL 80 mm. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FSalsa-2021-Beargrease-Carbon-SLX-12-speed-Fat-Bike">Priced at $3,199</a></p>

<p>I was leaning more towards this bike for my dream fat bike. But I was disappointed to see that it has no mounts for a rear rack. Although the Wo (cheaper option has). My dream with a fat bike is to travel across sandy desserts and the Arctic. For such off the grid adventures I think I would need panniers. </p>



<p>However this 2021 Kona Woo is a 26″ aluminum frame rigid fat bike with upper mid-range components. I am a fan of Kona since owning their Kona Sutra LTD. You get a carbon triple mount fork. With a 1 x 12 SX Eagle, NX groupset. SRAM NX-Eagle Dub Fat, 30t X-Sync Eagle crank and SRAM SX-Eagle 11-50t cassette. Priced at $2,099</p>
