<p>Have you been in the position when riding your bike and dog comes running up beside you and starts chasing you down? I have had this happen to me when I was bicycle touring in the USA and my first instinct was to stop and get off. But this is not always the best solution. It is a scary situation to be in. You don&#8217;t know if the dog just wants to play or if it wants to rip your leg off. </p>



<p><strong>So how do you deal with a dog chasing you on a bicycle tour? It seems the short answer is, if the dog is very aggressive, use dog repellent spray or pepper spray and keep riding. But if the dog is friendly, get off your bike to stop the dog chasing. </strong></p>



<p>Lets face it you are probably not going to out ride a dog. Everywhere I read they suggest that you stop and get off your bike and have your bike between you and the dog. This is said to stop the chase which is why the dog may be after you in the first place. For the thrill of chasing you down. But I have never done this, as I fear that the dog could be very aggressive and jump at you and potentially bite. </p>



<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong I love dogs and all animals for that matter. But regardless a dog running on a busy road is very dangerous. On my tour of Australia I had one encounter in a rural part. Where a playful looking dog started to approach me on a busy road. I got off my bike and try calling for it to get of the road and go back to its home. With the dogs owners yelling, the dog seem to have lost interest in me once it released i was a human on a strange two wheeled machine. But then it turned around to run back to its owners and it was almost struck by a car, the car missing it by a good metre. </p>



<p>It all comes down to many different variables in the situation. Busy road, and other potential dangers for the dog, aggressive or playful dog attitude, riding down hill and travelling over 30km/h (generally dogs can not keep up). and many other aspects play a part in what you may do in order to deter the dog.  </p>



<p>You need to assess the potential danger. What is the dogs intension? You can kind of tell by its character. Does it look playful chasing you to say hello. Or does it have its teeth drawn ready for dinner? The latter type of dog can be quite scary. Does the dog respond to commands when you yell at it? </p>



<p>If the dog seems to be playful, and responses to your commands with a innocent and apologetic look. Then I think it is safe to stop and direct the pup back to is home. </p>



<p>If the dog seems aggressive you could try getting off your bike and like mentioned before have your bike between you and the dog. As they dog notices you are a human most often they will stop. But if you get back on your bike they may start following you again.</p>



<p>You may want to also try maintaining eye contact with the dog. However I have read that some people recommend doing this and others don&#8217;t. Should you maintain eye contact with a dog? It seems you should not stare in their eyes, as this is a sign of dominance to a dog. Prolonged eye contact with and a straight gaze is generally deemed threatening behaviour to a dog. It seems rude and can encourage a challenge. You should also keep your eye on a unfamiliar dog obviously. But It is suggested to look at the dogs ears and feet. </p>



<p>Look as big as possible, if you show the dog you are big, much bigger then them they may back off and feel no need to confront you. </p>



<p>If the dog seems eager to bite your leg off. At least me personally I don&#8217;t want to stop. This is where you should yell at the dog. If the pup does not respond or stop chasing and looks like it dangerous. Then it is time for the dog repellent spray or pepper spray. It may be handy to get some for when travelling through rural areas, where dog encounters seem to be most common. </p>



<p>I had a encounter in America with two aggressive dogs who started running towards us barking like crazy, it was scary! I was going to stop and get of my bike but my cycling buddy Eric suggested we keep riding. And sooner or later they seem to have just lost interest in use when they noticed we were no longer in their territory. </p>



<p>This is a last resort defence if the dog will not stop. It must be stated that this can cause potential dangers for you and the dog. But what is not dangerous with a dog running loose on a road in the first place? The dog may run for your wheels and cause a crash. Or even bite at your legs or rip a hole in your panniers. I believe spraying the dog with some kind of dog repellent spray, teaches the pup a lesson. A important one that means chasing cyclists<strong> </strong>equals to bad idea and not fun. Typically to dog will be back to normal after a half hour. If you spray them in the eyes, nose or mouth area, but nowhere else. And it may do a favour to other cyclists in future riding through the same area. </p>



<h2>Other things to try and consider</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Don&#8217;t be fearful</strong>, dogs are able to sense fear just like any other emotion. Try talking to them in a happy, high pitched tone. This may calm them down and not see you as a threat.</li><li>If you can try <strong>avoid throwing stones</strong>, if you do so this may give the dog a reason to attack you. Only use this a a last resort. </li><li>If you don&#8217;t have pepper spray <strong>use your bike pump or a stick</strong>. To deter the dog away. Long sticks are best, it is recommend not to point it in the dogs eyes, but rather in the general direction of the dog. Most often they will back off. </li><li><strong>Use a water bottle and spray the dog</strong>. This seems like the most practical way as you have water with you, so just squirting the dog in the face might be enough to stop them. Even add vinegar to the water. </li><li><strong>Feed them</strong>. This may stop them in their tracks and be more interested in the food. </li></ul>



<h2>Why do dogs run after bikes?</h2>



<p>When A dog sees a bike riding past its chase mentality kicks into gear setting of the dogs prey drive. Feeding the predatory nature dogs have. Most young dogs see this as a playful game and may set of to chase and the game is on. </p>



<h2>Can a bike outrun a dog?</h2>



<p>In short, it depends on how fast you ride. Considering the fastest dog, a greyhound runs up to 80km/h, then German shepherds and border collies can run up to 45+ km/h. <strong>However in general, a average pet dog&nbsp;can&nbsp;run&nbsp;about 24 to 32 km/h (15–20 miles per hour) for short distances</strong>. <strong>A tourer rides around 15 to 20 km/h (9 to 12 miles per hour) or even less. So they will most likely keep up with you.</strong> Dogs are not endurance animals and can only maintain this for short distances. And will most likely loose interest in you if they get too far away from their home. </p>
