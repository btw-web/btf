<p>Okay so in this article we are comparing some of the best gravel bikes you can buy with a realistic price range. Meaning that they offer the most value for the dollars. As you start to get past $2,000 and up the bikes tend to offer very little extra in improvements, and this is where you generally see the value for money drop off. But we have 10 gravel bikes that are around the range of $1,000 to $2,000. We could have showed you some even cheaper gravel bikes which can be seen in our <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-gravel-bikes-under-500/">Best gravel bikes under $500</a> and <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/23-best-gravel-bikes-under-1000-budget-gravel-bikes/">$1,000 articles</a>. But to be honest some of these are not really the best bikes when it comes to value and quality. </p>



<p>When looking at these bikes the main things to really consider to make sure that you are getting the most bang for your buck is the Geometry and spec range of the bike. For example with geometry some of the gravel bikes are designed in a way that the geometry is longer in the chainstay resulting in a less responsive and sluggish feeling ride. This can even make the bike feel heavier even if it is not, just they way it rides. Then you have specs. To save on money bike brands will make really cheap bikes and the way they are able to pull this off is if they include a very low end spec on the bike and this is the main reason why some of the cheapest gravel bikes are not really the best value for money. </p>



<p>Also when looking at bikes especially for gravel grinding. Most riders get these types of bikes as they are looking for something to ride on road but also take it on trails. And if you are looking for a bikepacking. Gravel bikes are great for adventure. So therefore these bikes were also rated based on how adventure ready they are. Meaning the on bike comfort in terms of handlebar flare and again geometry like reach. But also how well they can accommodate any gear that you need for your bike explorations. Do they have a number of eyelets for mounting? Also the wider the tires you can fit the better also. Because if you are heading off-road you want something wide and supple. </p>



<p>Also other components (similar to specs) on the bikes like brakes are also very important when choosing a bike. Ideally you want a hydraulic disc brake compared to the mechanical disc brakes. As these are generally better for stopping power. </p>



<h1>2020 Marin Nicasio +</h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="436" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED-2.jpg?resize=720%2C436&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5560" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED-2.jpg?w=1734&amp;ssl=1 1734w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED-2.jpg?resize=300%2C181&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED-2.jpg?resize=768%2C465&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C619&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED-2.jpg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED-2.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Marin Nicasio + has to be one of the most value for money gravel bikes in 2020. It <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FMarin-Nicasio-650B-Bike-2020">comes in at only $849.99</a>. And personally I believe steel is the best material for a gravel bike, that you will use for adventures. And this rig is all steel. The Stack on this bike is 575 mm and reach is 378 mm for the reach (on a medium sized, 54cm). </p>



<p>When it comes to geometry this bike is well balanced and offers that comfort for longer days in the saddle if you plan to go on bikepacking trips. However you do get mechanical disc brakes which is where this bike will feel a little cheap. And it is only a 1&#215;9 drivetrain with the MicroSHIFT Advent, 1&#215;9 w/ Clutch Mech rear derailleur. With the FSA Tempo Compact, Narrow-Wide, 42T crank and SunRace 9-Speed, 11-46T cassette. On first inspection it seems like a limited gear range. The gear ratio works out to be 0.913 for the lowest gear and the highest gear ratio is 3.818. If you want to find out more about how chainring size effects a gravel bike, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/understanding-the-difference-in-chainring-sizes/">read more here.</a> But from these numbers in theory this bike would be not the best at climbing steep hills. It sits about the mid range when compared to all these bikes at climbing.</p>



<p>The bike comes with WTB Horizon, 650Bx47mm wheels and tires. With a max clearance, accommodating&nbsp;<em>tires</em>&nbsp;up to 700c x 40mm or 650b x 47mm (and mudguards). </p>



<p>When it comes to utility for storing gear you get one eyelet on either side of the fork, rear rack mounts and three water bottles cage mounts. Also the handlebars are a Marin Butted Alloy, Compact with 12º Flare. This little bit of flare is handy for that little extra comfort when riding gravel. </p>



<h1>2020 Canyon Grail AL 7.0</h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/full_2020_grail-al-7-0_2370_sr-bk_P5-1.png?resize=720%2C405&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5562" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/full_2020_grail-al-7-0_2370_sr-bk_P5-1.png?w=2400&amp;ssl=1 2400w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/full_2020_grail-al-7-0_2370_sr-bk_P5-1.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/full_2020_grail-al-7-0_2370_sr-bk_P5-1.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/full_2020_grail-al-7-0_2370_sr-bk_P5-1.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/full_2020_grail-al-7-0_2370_sr-bk_P5-1.png?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/full_2020_grail-al-7-0_2370_sr-bk_P5-1.png?w=1440 1440w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/full_2020_grail-al-7-0_2370_sr-bk_P5-1.png?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>In comparison this Canyon Grail gravel bike has a very aggressive geometry that is probably more preferred for racing or just shorter gravel grinding where you are probably not needing long term on bike comfort. Using a medium sized bike as an example here, the stack is 579 mm while the reach is 405 mm. This bike has a longer reach by 27mm which means it will stretch you forward on the bike more while the Nicasio+ is shorter, keeping your weight farther back for a more upright position and comfort. </p>



<p>So this Canyon is more suited for faster bikepacking or gravel riding. Also the new 2020 models don&#8217;t come with any rack mounts. </p>



<p>You get a 2&#215;11 Shimano GRX RX810 setup. This is where this bikes shines the most with the high end component level. Which is the best quality groupset in this list. However the bike is built from a aluminium frame and carbon fork. But you also do get hydraulic disc brakes on this bike. The bike has a Shimano RX600 46/30t crank and Shimano HG700 11-34 11s cassette. This bike is priced at around <a href="https://www.canyon.com/en-au/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/grail/grail-al-7.0/2370.html">$1,899</a> (for the 2&#215;11) But you can also pick up the 1x option. The tires that come standard are the Schwalbe G-One Bite 40 mm. With a little room to fit some slightly wider tires if desired. </p>



<h1>Cannondale Topstone 105</h1>

<p>The Topestone has a similar stack and reach to the Nicasio + offering a more relaxed riding position. For a medium sized Topstone you can expect a 579 mm stack and 385 mm reach. The same stack as the Canyon but shorter reach then the Canyon and yet 7mm longer then the Nicasio. While also the wheelbase is 1,040 mm where as the Nicasio is shorter at 999 mm and a longer chainstay length of 430mm on the Cannondale. Meaning this bike would ride rather well as a light tourer with a rear rack with that little extra clearance. You also get top tube bag eyelet mounts. </p>



<p>This bike has a nice spread of gearing for both climbing and descending with its 2&#215;11 Shimano 105 groupset. With a FSA Omega ME alloy, 46/30t crank and Shimano 105, 11-34t, 11-speed rear cassette. The bike is built around a alloy frame and carbon fork. You get hydraulic disc brakes and comes with the WTB Riddler TCS Light, 700 x 37c, tubeless ready tires. The Topstone has a max tire clearance for up to 42 mm tires. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F166454%2Fcannondale-topstone-al-105-bike-2020">The Topstone is priced at $1,750.00</a></p>



<p>The Topstone is a fantastic all rounder, from urban commuting to adventure seeking. With the sturdy wheels, large volume tires, relaxed geometry and multiple attachment points it makes it an ideal gravel bike. For the fair price point it still manages to balance speed and supreme comfort. A little downside would be the weight if that is really a concern, coming in at around 9.9 kg / 21.9 lbs. This could be upgraded later on, lets see what they do with next models, but the MTB wheels are rather heavy and this is where some of this weight is. </p>



<p>But this is where the value for this bike comes from. It can be used for pretty much any kind of riding. You can use it has a commuter, weekend gravel rides or bikepacking adventures. </p>

<p>Steel and carbon would have to be the perfect gravel bike combination in my opinion. You get the sturdiness of steel for the fork and the supplness from the carbon fork which helps to absorb the rough stuff. Could not find reach and stack numbers for this bike. However the wheelbase is nice a longer making it a stable bike for adventure cycling when you have a load on the bike. For the medium size you get a 1060 mm wheelbase and 455 mm chainstay length. </p>



<p>As this bike is budget friendly at just over $1000 you do get some compromises in components. Like only mechanical disc brakes. The gearing is relatively limited also but still decent quality with the mid range component level of  SRAM Apex 1. With a SRAM Apex 1, 44t chainring and SRAM PG1130 11-speed, 11-36t cassette. Giving you a gear ratio of 1.2 for the lowest gear and the highest gear ratio is 4. Due to the larger tooth crank at 44t you get limited gearing making it one of least best at climbing and descending in the list. If I was to purchase this bike I would install something smaller to get better use out of the gears for climbing. This could be changed with a smaller chainring at the front. </p>



<p>What I found rather interesting was that the front wheel is a Thru Axel and the rear is a quick-release. It seems a little odd to have two different kind of hubs/wheel attachments. Would probably just rather all thru axel to be honest. You do get rear rack mounts and fork mounts for cargo cages, plus your standard water bottle cages. </p>



<p>The bike comes with Hutchinson Overide 700c x 38mm tires and I believe you can get up to 47mm wide tires on this bike. It weighs in at 25 pounds or 11.33 kg. And <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F165510%2Fpure-cycles-gravel-adventure-apex-bike">priced at only $1,099.00 at REI.com</a>. So if weight is not a issue and you plan to ride more flat terrain (with the current gearing ratios) this bike should be a great choice. Again I would still buy if I changed chainring size (only cause where I ride it is very hilly) and it would be a great bike for the price. </p>



<h1>Salsa&nbsp;Journeyman Sora 650b</h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="409" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Journeyman_drop-bar-sora-650-Blue-1920x1080-1-1.jpg?resize=720%2C409&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5566" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Journeyman_drop-bar-sora-650-Blue-1920x1080-1-1.jpg?w=1049&amp;ssl=1 1049w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Journeyman_drop-bar-sora-650-Blue-1920x1080-1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Journeyman_drop-bar-sora-650-Blue-1920x1080-1-1.jpg?resize=768%2C436&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Journeyman_drop-bar-sora-650-Blue-1920x1080-1-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C582&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Journeyman_drop-bar-sora-650-Blue-1920x1080-1-1.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Not exactly a gravel bike but I still like to include it in with gravel bikes (officially considered a adventure touring bike) I really think it fits somewhere between the two. If you are after a value for money bike that is mostly built for off-road adventure then this bike has you covered. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/salsa-journeyman-review/">It is available in a series of different models</a>, although I personally like the Apex 1 it is the most expensive and I was going to include that build in the list but instead the most value for money would be their Journeyman Sora in the 650b wheel configuration. </p>



<p>A alloy and carbon build you get mechanical disc brakes and a lower end 2&#215;9 Shimano Sora groupset. Not the best in the list but it is around the $1000 price range. It is a adventure ready bike, with relaxed and comfortable geometry and the FSA Vero Pro Adventure, 46/30t crank along side the SunRace 9-speed 11-34t cassette. You get a decent range of gearing for all kinds of terrain and environments. Making it capable for carting gearing on bike. That is helped with the presents of three eyelets on either side of the fork, top tube bag mounting eyelets and your standard water cage mounts. </p>



<p>You do get some nice and wide WTB Nano Comp 650b tires that are 2.1 inches wide. The bike weighs in at 26 pounds or 11.79 kg. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=e295c418-295a-447c-b265-734e25f82503&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F133412%2Fsalsa-journeyman-sora-650-bike">Priced at $1,099 at REI.com</a></p>

<p>A full alloy bike with mechanical disc brakes a bargain at <a href="https://www.diamondback.com/haanjo3">only $1,000</a>. With the Haanjo you get a similar spec setup to the Journeyman Sora with the same Shimano Sora. You get the FSA Omega Adventure, 46/30T crank with Shimano HG400, 9 Speed Cassette, with 11-32T. The Haanjo 3 comes with <br>WTB Riddler Comp, 700x37c and a max tire clearance of up to 45mm. You do get rack mounts and a single fork mount with water bottle cage mounts. </p>



<p>Considering it comes with a modest component level it still has a decent gearing spread. Also the endurance geometry is also designed to place you in a more comfortable position that’s perfect for both long rides and rough roads. </p>

<p>Norco have some of the most premium gravel bikes, this is their cheapest model of the Search. Which is an adventure seeker that blurs the lines between mountain and road, pushing the limits of what you’d expect from&nbsp;a drop bar bike. You get alloy frame and carbon fork combination. With Schwalbe G-One Bite 700x38c tires. You get the mid range Shimano GRX groupset and mechanical disc brakes. </p>



<p>You get a Shimano GRX FC-RX600 46/30T crank and Shimano CS-HG50 11-36T cassette. And it also has carry abilities with the double mounts on the fork. And internal cable routing makes this bike look very clean and slipstreamed. </p>



<p>This sees a shorter wheels base and chainstay length then then some of the other bikes here. Making this potentially ride a little more snappy. Not sure how well it would ride with a pannier setup, but would be fine for bikepacking bags. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=3727a95c-b736-4887-82ff-a1d0ed6654a8&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.norco.com%2Fbikes%2F2020%2Froad%2Fgravel%2Fsearch-xr-aluminum%2Fsearch-xr-a2%2F">Priced at $1,599.00</a></p>

<p>Here is another super budget friendly bike at only $1,000. Giants entry level gravel grinder! Depending on what type of riding you had planned when you are looking for a gravel bike. But it seems this bikes overall geometry and ride feel is that similar to the the Canyon Grail, which feel like racing bikes for rough surfaces and ride very fast and are fun. But lack the endurance geometry for long term comfort when riding for weeks at a time with bike bags and gear. Which for this blog at least is our thing, so this is a lose for this bike for the point. But the wheelbase is similar to the Topstone, so I can see it still have some stability under some kind of load. </p>



<p>However if you are looking for something that is fast, snappy and more for commuting around town or even racing then this might be a good option. It doesn&#8217;t have the best components and falls on the modest to lower end for this list of bikes. With the 2&#215;9 Shimano Sora groupset. You get a FSA Vero Pro, 32/48 crank and Shimano CH-HG400, 11&#215;34 cassette. With Giant Crosscut AT 2, 700&#215;38 tires and hydraulic disc brakes which is surprising on such a budget friendly bike. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FGiant-Revolt-2-Bike-2020">Priced at $1,000</a> Also we have a <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/giant-revolt-2-review/">review on our blog here</a>. </p>

<p>The Kona Rove is one of the most popular gravel bikes for value out there. They have the full steel option as pictured above but you can also pick up some really sweet deals on 2019 models for <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FKona-Rove-NRB-DL-Bike-2019">less then $1,500 (that&#8217;s 35% off)</a></p>



<p>For this though we are going to talk about the ST (the purple gravel grinder). I personally own the Sutra LTD (similar bike but Kona&#8217;s adventure/gravel options) epic bike! This one though is more of a gravel/commuter bike. If you re looking for something that can take you around the city or light gravel rides and trips this bike is capable. </p>



<p>Built with a all steel base you get mechanical disc brakes and plenty of mounting options on the fork, frame and rear rack potential too. Featuring upper to mid range components. With the SRAM Rival 1 groupset with 40t X-Sync crank and SRAM PG1130 11-42t 11spd cassette. With plenty of room for wider tires which is what I love about these Kona bikes. You do get the WTB Venture TCS DUAL 650x47c tires on this Rove. <a href="http://konaworld.com/rove_st.cfm">Priced at around $1,600</a></p>

<p>Last but not least is probably one of the most bang for your buck of all! The Breezer Radar Expert! I say value because it has a Shimano Deore Rear Derailleur, Shimano Sora shifters. With a Breezer 2-pc w/hollow axle, 46/30T crank alongside a Shimano HG, 11-36t, 9-Speed cassette. The combination puts this bike at a upper-mid component level. With a full steel build and mechanical disc brakes. <a href="https://www.breezerbikes.com/bikes/adventure/radar/radar-expert">All for only $969.00</a> you really cannot go wrong for such a versatile gravel grinder at that price. </p>



<p>Comes with WTB Riddler Race, 700 x 45c tires. You get clearance&nbsp;for&nbsp;tires&nbsp;up to 2.1-inches (53mm). And all the mounting options for a grand bike adventure. Also the geometry is designed for comfort over the long haul. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/breezer-radar-expert-review-best-budget-gravel-bike/">Read the review about this rig on our blog</a>. </p>
