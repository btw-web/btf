<p>I must say I am a sucker for bike bags! The idea of writing this article of the best rando bags and yes racks too, got me so excited. But rando bags are such a useful thing to come out of the randonneur scene. </p>



<p>When it comes to rando bags, the best thing about then is the functionality. Yes they also do look rather classy and retro. But more than most very useful. Like starting at the top of the flap lid you get a clear pocket which is traditionally used for paper maps but can be used in the more modern way with your phone or a GPS unit. </p>



<p>The inside of the bag is where it is at. The large boxy nature of rando bags allow for such a huge amount of storage capabilities. Perfect for packing heaps of stuff from cameras, drones tripods and anything else you wish. </p>



<p>But if you are thinking about a rando bag being a cool idea for your next adventure. You have to have in mind that these bags are supported with a unique rack. And only some bikes can fit such racks, aka rando bikes. You can pick up rando specific forks. However this added stability when it comes to the rack allows for more and heavier gear to be carried in a rando bag compared to a bikepacking dry bag roll style bag. These bags often only work the best when you carry lightweight stuff like, fabrics, sleeping bag, tent and all that. </p>



<p>But because of the way these bags sit on the bike with rando racks it lowers where on the bike it sits effecting handling a little less if it was more top heavy on the steering. It is safe to say that rando bags do effect steering a little but far less if they were to be fitted higher on the handlebar. </p>



<p>it is also nice to see some of the more modern takes on the rando bags to have back pockets with a modern style, attached to the rando bag for extra storage. Much like a detachable stem or feed bag. Also some of the rando bags come with a pocket for even ore storage of tools at the front. </p>



<p>They are great if you have minimal things that you take to school or work on your commute. And say you need a couple things they would generally fit in this bag. </p>



<p>There are a few things that are worth noting before going out and committing to any of these bags listed below. First you need to make sure your current bike is going to fit a rando bag and rack system on it. As I mention in the rack section. Racks for rando bags a very unique and specific and mount differently than a normal front rack.  hey require a mid-eyelet for mounting or you will have to house clamp. Also you might want to consider a rack that has a decaleur. Which is a form of extra stability for the bag to stop it slopping about. </p>



<p>With the extra gear needed to make a rando bag system work. Comes with it more of a cost and you will have to end up paying almost double the price of the bag. So please be aware of extra costs. Then there is availability I tried my best not to include bags that are out of stock and hard to find quantity of. But still this type of bag is very niche and there is not a large demand for them like a typical bikepacking bag, so less is made. </p>



<p>If you plan to ride technical single track only with a rando bag setup, you might want to think again. I am not talking from experience here, but there is a possibility that the rack could snap and break on very rough stuff. That said a rando setup is fine for road touring and even gravel grinding. </p>



<p>Okay with that all said let&#8217;s get into the rando bags and racks. <em>*If you want to buy any of these Randonneur Bags and Racks, doing it via the product links give Cycle Travel Overload a small commission which goes into creating more great resources for the bike travel community.</em></p>

<p>I am a fan of Restrap their bags are great quality. I personally own their Bar Bag system with the roll drybag and food pouch and holster. It works really well and I am happy with the quality of the bag materials. They say this rando top rack bag is great for any ride. With easy access pockets, quick release Fidlock magnetic attachment, and a handy shoulder strap. The bag is super strong and reliable. Thanks to the combination of the magnetic fastenings and military-grade waterproof fabrics. Also in general Restrap bags just look so stylish. The Rando bag weighs in at 970 grams. Dimensions: W30 x H25 x D22cm and it comes in two sizes a small or large (17 L) <a href="https://us.restrap.com/products/rando-bag-large">$217.49</a></p>

<p>There are only a few brands that make some of the best rando bags and Swift Industries are one of them. If we take a quick step back from their rando bag. They did a calibration with Kona on their Rove bikes and that thing is incredible. That bike comes with Swift bags but the Paloma handlebar bag. My point is that they make some great bags and make this Rove look amazing!  </p>

<p>Depending where you look for this Nitto Mini Front Rack it is sold out in most places. Please note that this rack has a 4.4 pound weight limit or around 2Kg. This is a strong rack, however it is recommended to use a tether to loop around the tongue of the rack and the handlebars. If you look closely a the photo above you will see a red tether. This rack is not for every bike and if you’re using V-brakes you may want to consider the Mark’s Rack instead. If the v-brake arms aren’t tall enough, they’ll block the rack mount from entering the fork crown. Best for a bike with cantilevers where you are looking for a smallish rack up there for a bag or basket or stuff-sack. <a href="https://www.rivbike.com/products/nitto-mini-front-rack-32f-20020">Priced at $140.00 when available</a>. </p>

<p>This rack is a great option over the standard pannier rack or mini rack. It is not your traditional rando rack but still can be used like one. As it has a wider platform than most racks. Like they say &#8220;it is better at carrying odd-sized and bulky loads like a pizza or box full of kittens&#8221;. It is designed for 700c and 26&#8243; wheel bicycles. Made from a CrMo construction and also available in Stainless Steel. With a maximum load of 10 kg or 22 lbs. <a href="https://www.somafab.com/archives/product/porteur-rack-black">Read more</a></p>
