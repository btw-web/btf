<p>Before we get straight into looking at your best touring saddles. We need to cover the basics of bike saddle comfort and what elements result in the reduction of discomfort when touring for long days in the saddle. </p>



<h3>How do I choose a comfortable bike saddle?</h3>



<p>When looking for a saddle for your next cycling adventure, you want to choose something that is going to be comfortable and not cause any pain or irritation. So how then do you choose to best bike saddle for your bum? Not all saddles fit perfectly to everyone. There is no one size fits all, as we are all made up of different shapes and sizes. </p>



<p>First lets think about the reason why you are looking for a new saddle in the first place. What is wrong with your current saddle? Is it uncomfortable? or just warn down and you are looking for a new one? In this case looking for a saddle with similar shape and size is fairly straight forward. As there are many similar options out there on the market.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer alert: If you’re experiencing numbness or major discomfort, checking in for a&nbsp;clinical bike fit&nbsp;is a very good idea – ideally one where saddle pressure mapping will be part of the process. If there’s swelling or pain off the bike, a trip to your GP is also advised.</em></p>



<p>But, my guess is the saddle you currently have is not working for you. So what do you do? </p>



<p>What is not working with your current saddle? Observe what is going on exactly do course the irritation and discomfort. Is it a incorrect bike fit maybe and the seatpost is simply not at the right position for your hight? Or is the saddle too wide casing you to rub? </p>



<p>What is your most comfortable riding position? Where does your bottom naturally want to sit when normally positioned on the saddle? Are you wanting to sit more on the nose but the saddle is hard and narrow?</p>



<p><strong>Measure your sit bones</strong></p>



<p>So how do you get the right saddle width that works with your sit bones size? First, you need to measure your sit bones. The measurement you want is between the centres of your ischial tuberosities. Which are the pointy lower parts of your pelvic bone on either side. You can go to a bike dealer they often have a device which will allow you to measure these points. But if you want to do it at home, I found a way from a online forum. &#8220;Take a piece of aluminium kitchen foil and place it on a carpeted stair. Sit on the foil, lean forward a bit to approximate your riding position, then lift your feet. This should leave a good impression of your rear in the foil, and you can measure between the two points of deepest impression to get your sit bone width.&#8221;</p>

<p>If this method does not work for you, there are other DIY ways to measure your sit bones, in that forum which can be read <a href="https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/9815/is-it-possible-to-measure-your-sit-bones-at-home">here</a>. Some mention, using Playdough and cling film. Or using &#8220;two small erasers, put them on a chair, sat on them and moved them around until they felt like I was sitting on my sit bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>In general a narrow sit bone width would be 100mm or less, medium 100-130mm, wide over 130mm.</p>



<p><strong>Saddle size, shape and material</strong></p>



<p>Now that you have your sit bone measurement it should now be easy to get the right sized saddle for you. Since we are after a saddle for touring, as we will be in the saddle for long extended periods of time, day in day out. You want a saddle that provides cushioning for your sit bones and a fairly long, narrow nose.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="664" height="465" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Men-vs-Women.jpg?resize=664%2C465" alt="" class="wp-image-2157" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Men-vs-Women.jpg?w=664&amp;ssl=1 664w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Men-vs-Women.jpg?resize=300%2C210&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Men-vs-Women.jpg?resize=50%2C35&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Men-vs-Women.jpg?resize=500%2C350&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVipXrs-7kAhWc63MBHX6rBW0QMwhPKAIwAg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.singletracks.com%2Fblog%2Fmtb-gear%2Fhow-to-choose-the-best-mountain-bike-saddle%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw3AMvsi5m-lpsCsXqy_0VXh&amp;ust=1569584444705438&amp;ictx=3&amp;uact=3" target="_blank">Mountain Bike Saddle &#8230; singletracks.com</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>One of the more important aspects when looking at a new saddle is the saddle width, being able to support your sit bones. A saddle’s width is measured from edge to edge across the top of the saddle at the widest point. So when purchasing look out for a saddle that suits your sit bone measurements. You also don&#8217;t want a saddle that is much wider then you need as this can cause rubbing and chafing.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t assume the more cushion and soft a saddle is the more comfortable it is. This is not true. I found this out the hard way, or should I say the &#8216;soft&#8217; way! I used one of those gel saddle covers that turn any saddle into what I thought would be a super comfortable saddle. But this was not the case. After days on end in the saddle on tour, even with padded cycling shorts, I was chafing. It seem to have caused discomfort and pressure as my body sunk into the saddle. </p>



<p>The material of a saddle is another important aspect in making your final decision. Saddles are made from a variety of different materials and two main parts make up any one saddle. The top covering where you bottom contacts the saddle and the under railing. </p>



<p>Synthetic : all parts of the saddle are made from such synthetic material. Meaning they are low maintenance and lightweight. Being a more popular option for the average cyclist. However some tourers say they don&#8217;t particularly like these types of saddle like the Brook C17 and such, as they are too hard and not as comfortable as other options, which I will cover more in the different touring bike saddle options listed below. But they also require no break-in time, and with some padded cycling shorts can equate to a comfortable touring bike saddle option. </p>



<p>Leather : On the other hand leather saddles are made from a leather top covering stretched over a metal railing. The down side to leather saddles is the breaking in period which can take around 200 miles or so. And during this break in time it can be very uncomfortable. But on the upside once the saddle conforms to your body shape and size, it fits like a glove. And is very comfortable. Another downside to leather material saddles is waterproofing. They are susceptible to the environment and over time if not treated with&nbsp;a leather conditioner on occasion. The saddle can deteriorate from water and UV exposure. </p>



<p>Cotton : Cotton saddles provide comfort through some stretching and moving a little as you ride. Offering excellent comfort and control while peddling. And they also don&#8217;t require such a long break in period like leather does. </p>



<p>Nothing beats sitting on a saddle and seeing how it feels. I recommend going to a bike store and getting a saddle fixed to your bike and taking it for a test ride to see how it feels. </p>



<p><strong>Your flexibility, position and posture</strong></p>



<p>This can come down to how your bike is setup, in terms of a correct bike fit. If your set is too high or low, or your handle bars are not positioned to suit your individual riding style. It all can result in discomfort in the saddle. And not only that but other areas of your body, like knee and achilles may result in pain too. </p>

<p>Making sure you get a correct bike fit is highly recommended, resulting in the correct positioning and on bike posture. It is best to get this right as you are spending many hours each day in the saddle, you want to be as comfortable as possible. </p>



<h4>Should you get a centre cutout?</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="464" height="269" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bc30ee05-d20f-4a9d-9330-d454b5fa21cb.jpeg?resize=464%2C269" alt="" class="wp-image-2156" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bc30ee05-d20f-4a9d-9330-d454b5fa21cb.jpeg?w=464&amp;ssl=1 464w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bc30ee05-d20f-4a9d-9330-d454b5fa21cb.jpeg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bc30ee05-d20f-4a9d-9330-d454b5fa21cb.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bc30ee05-d20f-4a9d-9330-d454b5fa21cb.jpeg?resize=346%2C200&amp;ssl=1 346w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>A centre cutout in a saddle offers some great comfort benefits. They are designed to protect your perineum, which is the part of the body between your sit bones. Which houses nerves and artiest that are very sensitive. These saddles remove the material that would otherwise be in the position of your perineum. Resulting in the elimination of pressure on the perineum and providing airflow and comfort during long rides. </p>



<p>Some saddles are even designed to have a slight indent in this area. For some riders it works great but as we are all different it may not work for you. </p>



<p>If you want to read even more about touring saddles and getting the correct fit for you. I would suggest heading over to Alees <a href="https://www.cyclingabout.com/saddle-comfort-for-cyclists-the-best-bicycle-touring-seats/">article</a> over at Cycling About. </p>



<h3>Tips to improve your comfort on the saddle</h3>



<p>If you are still feeling some discomfort in the saddle here are some extra tips to help you out. You could slightly adjust your riding style, as riding many hours can just generally cause discomfort and perineum compression, regardless if you have a saddle that fits and is comfortable. </p>

<ul><li>Get up off the saddle from time to time when riding and stand up stretching and releasing that constant pressure that is put on your perineum</li><li>Use your legs to reduce the pressure when travelling over bumps and stand up.</li><li>The most common fix or added comfot to a saddle, is wearing padded bike shorts. As they can help minimize friction, wick moisture, resulting in minimal chafing if any and cushion bumps. </li><li>Maybe even consider a suspension seatpost&nbsp;on your touring bike to reduce the shock on bumpy riding conditions. </li></ul>



<h3>List of the Best Touring Bike Saddles</h3>



<p><strong>So by now you might be asking, so what is the best saddle for long distance cycling?</strong></p>



<p>Okay, so I asked around 50 bike tourers what saddles they use and can recommended to someone who is getting started in bike touring and wants the most comfortable bike touring saddle. Below I have included all their recommendations. </p>

<p>The B17 saddle has firmly established itself as the saddle of choice for long distance cyclists. Brooks have been producing this saddle since the 1890&#8217;s and since then it has stayed essentially the same, because it works. </p>

<p>This is without a doubt the most popular touring saddle when it comes to comfort. Made from leather the Brook B17 is as comfortable as sitting on a couch. Well maybe not that comfortable. But how do I know? Well I have one too. </p>

<p>When I first got mine it did take a little while to break in which was not even really that uncomfortable to be honest, but still not comfortable. after about 300 kilometres, I was in business. And amazed at how truely comfortable this saddle is. I got mine fitted at a bike shop, where the saddle was treated, fitted to the bike and even tightened. </p>

<p>My mate Eric, was surprised when he jumped on my Surly on our European tour, too feel its super comfort, and it was broken-in to my bum. But he still mentioned that it was so much more comfortable compared to his hard and generic saddle on his touring bike. </p>

<p>I personally love this saddle and could go on and on about it. But I am going to save that for a dedicated Brooks B17 review. Let just say it is the last saddle you will ever need.</p>



<h4>Brooks B17 with Imperial Flyer </h4>

<p>Another option for a B17 is the Imperial Flyer option which comes with a spring system at the base of the saddle for extra comfort. &#8220;I love the imperial flyer! The springs really do help avoid compression in your lower back on rough terrain. I&#8217;m not one to worry about grams and gladly trade a few for a great deal of comfort increase!&#8221;</p>

<p>Some tourers have mentioned that they use the Brook C17, which is not as popular as the B17. The all-weather C17 option is a more improved then the previous C17. The Cambrium series is not the flattest face surface and is very curved, meaning that depending on your sit bone measurement you may need a larger size saddle, unless you want to sit on the rivets. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1252" height="311" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/616w13qbPbL._AC_SL1460_.jpg?fit=720%2C179" alt="" class="wp-image-2149" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/616w13qbPbL._AC_SL1460_.jpg?w=1252&amp;ssl=1 1252w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/616w13qbPbL._AC_SL1460_.jpg?resize=300%2C75&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/616w13qbPbL._AC_SL1460_.jpg?resize=768%2C191&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/616w13qbPbL._AC_SL1460_.jpg?resize=1024%2C254&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/616w13qbPbL._AC_SL1460_.jpg?resize=50%2C12&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>A owner of this saddle mentioned that they have a sit bone width of about 125mm and were using a 162mm saddle. Because of the strong curvature it sits like a much smaller saddle. This new C17 all-weather version is made from nylon. Which is said to be fade resistant. While to previous model had a organic cotton&nbsp;covering which over time was reported to have faded. Out of the box the new C17 is a little bit tacky to the touch but hopefully this will soon wear off. </p>

<p>The C17 has had mixed reviews from many of the bike tourers I talked to for this article. &#8220;It works best for me, but takes getting used to. Also I’ve found it must be tilted back until you find the sit bones. Takes a while to position.&#8221; Also some mentioned that, &#8220;The C17 Cambium is hassle free and wide enough, but a touch firmer&#8221;. And also, &#8220;C17 is for ideal for me.&#8221; &#8220;I have both a C17 and a C19 and they are great.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ST Core Prime is designed to relieve the sit bones from discomfort, and reducing the bumps and further discomfort caused when riding. All thanks to the floating TwinShell concept with the ergonomic core, that supports overall pelvic movement when pedalling. </p>

<p>This specific saddle is designed to suit the needs and requirements of touring and e-bike riders. Suited for Sit -Bone widths from 12cm to 16cm and offering gender specific shapes and relief channels, creating maximum comfort. </p>

<p>Some users of this saddle have mentioned that, &#8220;It took a few stops to get the seat adjusted. After that really comfortable ride every time. 600 miles and climbing.&#8221; One of the bike tourers I asked said that it is the &#8220;best on paper, and thankfully all well translated in my own personal use&#8221;. </p>

<p>Is another option that is recommended by fellow bike tourers. That is entirely waterproof, with full aluminum rivets. Manufactured using 100% Organic (vegan) cotton canvas. The top is suspended over a one-piece braided carbon frame making the C13 light and strong. With a natural vulcanised rubber shell that follows the movements of the rider for responsive control. </p>

<p>Another bike tourer I asked regarding what saddle they use was Eric, with the Fabric Line Elite Shallow. &#8220;I&#8217;m digging my Fabric Line Elite Shallow, though I have done few multi-day rides. Still, i&#8217;ve never had an issue with it riding gravel and pavement.&#8221; This new line is 142 mm compared to the 134 mm of the original line. Designed for riders who want a standard width saddle and a pressure relief channel. The saddle is specifically designed for riders who experience numbness after long days in the saddle. </p>

<p>A few bike tourers really like the Selle Anatomica X Series saddles. The WaterShed<em>&nbsp;</em>leather top is supported by a stiffer laminate layer glued to the underside. Supported by exceptionally long Chromoly rails. The slot shape of the saddle provides instant comfort, no waiting period for the saddle to break in, it feels good from day one. The slot eliminates perineal&nbsp;pressure, sit bone pain, and&nbsp;saddle sores. </p>

<p>If you are looking for a budget Touring Bike saddle option, this might be the one for you! Recommended by multiple tourers I was talking to. &#8220;The Charge Spoon cost me £23, instantly comfortable and beat all the other more expensive saddles I&#8217;ve ever had including Brooks. Expensive is not always best.&nbsp;The brooks saddles are though&#8221;</p>



<p>You can pick up this saddle for <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2mPjxsf">only $34.95</a></strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2mPjxsf"> on Amazon</a>, it also has some great ratings on there too. Mik even says that it is there, &#8220;saddle of choice on my 3 bikes&#8221;. </p>

<p><strong>Are leather bike saddles better?</strong></p>



<p>In-terms of longevity and comfort in most cases yes they are the better option. When compared however to synthetic saddle options they can be a little more expensive. </p>



<p>One thing to keep in mind with leather saddles is the susceptibility to the environment. They can get damaged over time when exposed to wet weather, over and over. To prevent, it is best to treat with a proofide saddle dressing. </p>



<p>Most leather bike saddles do have a break-in period which can deter some people from even trying them. But if you can get past a few hundred km&#8217;s with a hard saddle. You will get life long comfort. </p>



<p><strong>Are Brooks saddles really that comfortable?</strong></p>



<p>In my own opinion and first hand experience for the brooks B17 at least it is super comfortable once broken-in. I can not speak for some Brooks models and I hear some tourers don&#8217;t like some of the Brooks saddles. But it is proven that the classic B17 is the most comfortable option. </p>
