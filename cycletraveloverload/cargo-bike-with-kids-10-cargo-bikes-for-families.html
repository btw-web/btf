<p>Cargo bikes are the ultimate replacement bike option for a car. If you live in a cycle friendly neighborhood where you don&#8217;t have to travel very far to do shopping and run the kids to school, these types of bikes might be the perfect choice rather than a car. </p>



<p>Here at Cycle Travel Overload we are more about bikepacking and bike touring. But we still love the idea of cargo biking with the fam. After all it is still &#8220;cycle travelling&#8221;. And with some of the cargo bike options out there. It can make total sense to ditch the car and save the cents or dollars. </p>



<p>When I first got introduced to cargo bikes I was familiar with the longtail options like the Surly Big Fat Dummy. But as I have discovered there is a few different types and options of cargo bikes out there. With some great features and options for those looking to specifically use to transport the kids. </p>



<p>Honesty I am hooked on the idea of cargo bikes for a young family. It is such a great way to get kids on bikes early and get them excited from all the fun and adventures they can have from such a young age. </p>



<h3>Why A Cargo Bike?</h3>



<p>There are other bike transportation options out there then just a cargo bike. You can get a trailer for a bike that you might already have. Which is less costly then buying a cargo bike. Or you can get a child bike seat that mounts on the bike like a rack would. But these options are probably best if you are just getting started and before you know if your kids will like being on the bike with you. But if you are looking for more when it comes to transporting your kids then a cargo bike is the ultimate options. But why are they preferable? </p>



<ul><li>Perfect vehicle to run errands when you don&#8217;t have a car. They are so versatile when it comes to carting gear for shopping, visiting the market or taking the kids to school. That extra carrying capacity is why they are so versatile. </li><li>They are still great bike options for those without a family either. Young city-dwellers can benefit from them too. As it is becoming more trendy for youngsters to live that urban lifestyle. And as urban density increases, the use of cars for individual transportation and hauling becomes more difficult and not smart for the health of the environment. </li><li>They are a good fit for everyone. With some cargo bikes offering electric assists it makes it more open for people that would otherwise have trouble riding a bike that hauls gear. </li><li>The type of stuff and weight for the matter varies and offers transportation solutions for a range of things. Some cargo bikes can carry up to 800 pounds (363 kilograms). While there are some very creative hauling ideas hout there while using a cargo bike. </li><li>Rather than a child&#8217;s seat mounted to your bike. A cargo bike is adaptable for cycling with babies all the way up to big kids. So the initial investment pays off for years to come. </li><li>When you consider the cost of a cargo bike compared to a car it is a lot cheaper. </li></ul>



<h3>Types of Cargo Bikes</h3>



<p>There are about three of the most common cargo bikes; longtail, long john and front-load trike. </p>



<h4>Longtail</h4>



<p>Are similar to a normal bike in the way they ride. But have a extra long rear. The extended rack can be used in a variety of ways. For child seats or large panniers bags. You can also use a &#8216;cage&#8217; to transport the kids. These type of bikes a generally lightest and the most agile to handle, allowing 1 to 3 kids to ride along with you. </p>



<h4>Long John</h4>



<p>This type of bike has the cargo area at the front of the rider with a linking steering system, connecting the steering to the front wheel. These are more common in European countries with vibrant biking culture, like the Netherlands. They can be heavy and more difficult to pedal uphill. But gives you so much storage options for carry many kids and gear. These are used as carrier bicycles for bike delivers as well due to the reason of them being able to carry so much stuff. </p>



<h4>Front-Load Trike</h4>



<p>Again these bikes can be rather heavy, but they are a good option for carting the kids around town. Very similar to a long john style cargo bike but with three wheels. But the load area generally sits over the top of the front wheel. </p>

<p>In no particular order as some of the best and most recommended cargo bikes for hauling all the gear you need and the kids!</p>

<p>This is the bike that I was personally looking at in this cargo bike category. As it is still a great option for towing the kids around town on. It also makes a exception adventure bike. With the fat tires you get that added suppleness which is key when carry cargo. But it is also a great bike to take one a sandy adventure across the Australia outback. Well at least that is what I intent to use it for. <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FSurly-Big-Fat-Dummy-Complete-Bike-Thorfrost">Priced at $3,025</a> or you can get the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FSurly-Big-Fat-Dummy-Complete-Bike">2018 model for $2899</a></p>
