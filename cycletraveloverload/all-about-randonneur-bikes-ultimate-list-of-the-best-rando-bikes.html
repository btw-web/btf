<p>Rando bikes are they a thing of the past? I do personally have a thing for vintage bikes. And these types of adventure bikes speak retro! So today we are going to chat randonneur bikes and share with you some of my personal favourites. You can pick up modern versions of the famous rando bike today. So what is a rando bike? And what is the point of them?</p>



<p>These bikes are for those touring fanatics that love a well made bike with 70s to 80s technology. But who can blame them, I am digging all of these bikes that will be mentioned soon. </p>



<h2>What Is A Randonneur Bike?</h2>



<p>If you have no ideal what a Rando bike is. Lets go back to randonneuring! Also know as Audax Cycling it is a long-distance cycling sport. Where riders are to race on a course for more then 200km generally. Passing through checkpoints every few tens of km&#8217;s. And the aim is to finish the course in a specific time limit. A Randonneur bike can really be anything that is human powered for such events with not much restrictions. However, the general description of a rando bike is a bike that fits somewhere between a dedicated road racing bike and a touring bike. </p>



<p>Considering most events take place on road, I like to think of a rando event like a modern day bikepacking race but with a touring bike feel. The bikes are essentially the earlier days take on bikepacking races with the bike technology they had at the time. Now days we have the benefits of more mixed terrain bikes that are like road bikes but can tackle mountain bike trails too. But for those who enjoy ultra road racing these rando bikes can still be used or even for light-touring!</p>



<p>These rando bikes usually have lightweight steel frames, drop handlebars, relaxed (i.e. comfortable) frame geometry, medium-width tyres, triple chainsets, moderately low gearing, and the capacity to carry lightweight luggage. Mudguards and lighting systems are also common, and may be required for some events. Dynamo hubs are also popular on these bikes. </p>



<p>Due to the lighter weight nature for carrying gear. Panniers might still be used. But more commonly is the use of what are now called &#8220;rando bags&#8221;. Which are large volume handlebar bags and saddle bag. That are commonly mounted onto the bike via a small rando rack. Generally the geometry of the bike is designed to ride better with a large bag at the front for better control. </p>



<h2>The Fork</h2>



<p>The whole idea of the designed involved with a rando bikes fork is to accomodate a large bag up front but still ride comfortably. For a modern road bike with such a bag mounted there is a lack of stability, the weight of the bag and it contents. Would upset the handling of a standard racing bike. The goal is to have a well balanced bike. This is achieved by the bikes geometry up front, the bikes had average head tube angles but very large fork offsets or rake, a combination that is described as “low trail”.</p>

<p>For example when we take a look at one of the randonneur bikes from the list below and compare it to a more modern gravel/adventure bike. you can see that there is a large difference in the trail. 30mm less on this Masi Speciale Randonneur Elite compared to a Kona Sutra LTD. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="294" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-30-at-12.17.14-pm.png?resize=720%2C294&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-5664" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-30-at-12.17.14-pm.png?w=916&amp;ssl=1 916w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-30-at-12.17.14-pm.png?resize=300%2C122&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-30-at-12.17.14-pm.png?resize=768%2C314&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-30-at-12.17.14-pm.png?resize=50%2C20&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption>Rake length comparing Rando &amp; Gravel bikes</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Also as you can see above the Rack number on the Masi Rando bike is larger then the Kona. This is common with randonneur bikes. You will see even larger number with some other options. </p>



<p>The frame is also built with the accomodation to mount the small rando front rack to support the rando bag. </p>



<p>But anyway I have compiled a list of some of my personal favourite randonneur bikes and I hope it gives you some ideas for what to look for if you are currently in the market for one. </p>
