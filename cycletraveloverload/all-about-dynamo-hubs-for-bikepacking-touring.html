<p>Going off bikepacking into the wilderness but tight on space? Worried about your GPS flatlining? In this article we are exploring the dynamo hub and how it could be what takes your adventures that bit further.</p>



<p><strong>What is this ‘dynamo’ saviour you speak of?</strong></p>



<p>Do you remember learning about energy and motors at school? No? Well, a dynamo is another word for an electric generator. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/electric-generator">Defined as</a>:</p>



<p>“any machine that converts mechanical energy into electricity”.</p>



<p>It’s the opposite of an electric motor that uses electricity to power a motor. This means you can use your legs to power your lights. </p>



<p><strong>I can’t fit an electric generator on my bike!</strong></p>



<p>You may remember the images of flickering, weak lights on the bikes of Europeans after the war. Those were dynamo lights, but we have come a long way since then. Originally, dynamos on bikes were called ‘bottle dynamos’ and they fitted to the forks and harvested the rotational energy from the front wheel. They created a lot of drag and tyre wear, had poor connections in the rain and were not very efficient. These days, the Germans (the best dynamos are German made due to their cycling laws) have made dynamos so efficient that your lights could be mistaken for a motorbike! The dynamo no longer sits on your front wheel creating lots of drag, it now sits within the hub and you wouldn’t even know it was there. Pairing with the LED light advancements a dynamo powered light can challenge any battery powered light. </p>



<p><strong>But how does a dynamo hub work?</strong></p>



<p>Modern hub dynamos aren’t technically dynamos, they are magnetos, but don’t get bogged down with the terminology. They have magnets inside that rotate with a copper coil as you turn your wheel. The action of the coil passing around the magnetic poles creates electrical current through electromagnetism. The faster you pedal, the more electricity you generate.</p>



<p>On a long ride you can generate enough power to charge your battery pack and keep your lights shining bright. Generally speaking, even at 10mph you can create enough power to get around 500 lumens from your light.</p>



<p><strong>Will a dynamo hub slow me down?</strong></p>



<p>The key things to think about when looking at dynamos are efficiency, drag and weight.</p>



<p>The efficiency of a dynamo is its ability to generate electricity from the amount of mechanical power it receives. Ideally you want to put less effort in to get more out. The higher the spec of dynamo the more efficient it tends to be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The drag is the rolling resistance. Something you may be familiar with from purchasing tyres or bearings. Obviously, you want as little resistance as possible so you’re not fighting your dynamo on each push. For the coil and the magnets to work you will always need a little bit of resistance, but you probably won’t notice their minuscule needs. Here’s where the older dynamos fell down, and left you with lacklustre lighting and tired legs. There can be up to a 20% difference in drag from budget to top end dynamo hubs so have a read around before committing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The average dynamo hub weighs around 400g, when added to your wheelset they can total about 2000g depending on your bike. If you’re on a longer trip you will be carrying less battery packs so this may even out but it’s something to consider. </p>



<p><strong>Why choose a dynamo hub?</strong></p>



<p>Whether you’re an eco warrior, worried about safety or going out into the unknown, the dynamo hub could just be the answer you’re looking for.</p>



<p>Here are some reasons to choose a dynamo hub.</p>



<ol><li><strong>They are better for the environment</strong>. You’re generating your own electricity, how much more eco friendly does it get? There’s no waste, there’s no plastic packaging from the shop every time you have to buy a new set and there’s no need to use excess electricity on the go.</li><li><strong>You will always be well lit. </strong>Rest assured you will be seen and safe whenever you start pedalling. New dynamo lights have ‘standlights’ in them, this is a capacitor that stores some energy to keep your lights on for a few minutes even when you’re not pedalling! So you will be seen at all times.</li><li><strong>You can be as forgetful as you want</strong>. No need to remember to pack your lights or battery packs or even remember to charge them, dynamo hubs are integrated into your bike. This means you never have that heart sinking moment and you can focus your energy on remembering more fun things.</li><li><strong>You can cycle for as long as you want</strong>. Whether you’re racing home from work before it gets dark or you&#8217;re out bikepacking in the wilderness, you no longer need to think about running out of charge. You’ve got light and a power source right at your feet.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You don’t need to buy new ones</strong>. The dynamo is fixed to your bike and they are difficult to steal or lose. The hub is so discreet that no one will know what the difference is and they are rarely a target for thieves. They have very long lifespans, meaning if you look after them they can easily look after you for over 5 years.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Touring, bikepacking and dynamo hubs</strong></p>



<p>The modern day bikepacker wouldn’t be without a dynamo. Long days of cycling through the wilderness without a plug to be seen often means carrying lots of battery packs or planning your overnight stay near civilization. By having a dynamo you can charge your devices whilst you cycle, so you can extend your adventures without the added gear. Yey! You can get inbuilt USB adapters to charge your devices so you don’t have to remember that either. On new or long rides the USB port can link straight into your GPS device and keep you on track all day long.</p>



<p><strong>How much will they cost me?</strong></p>



<p>If you’re budget conscious look away now. Having a dynamo fitted to your bike means having at least the front wheel transformed, if you want an inbuilt USB port and rear lighting too then the job is bigger. You can either buy machine made wheels which are cheaper or you can get one hand crafted which will likely ride smoother but will cost you more.</p>



<p>In general, a basic dynamo set up will set you back around $400. If you’re after an all singing all dancing set up you can easily spend more than $1000. Although this sounds expensive, remember, you need to buy less battery packs, you won’t be replacing your lights when they get stolen or you lose them, and you’ll be saving the environment one push at a time.</p>
