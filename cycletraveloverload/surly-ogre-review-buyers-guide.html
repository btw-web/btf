<p>Are you looking for that simple yet versatile bikepacking rig for all your adventures. The Ogre might just be it! Described by Surly as a steel utility vehicle that is designed for full-loaded exploration, either across town or country. Really categorised as a touring bike or all-season commuter bike. This doesn&#8217;t mean you cannot take it on around the world tours or bikepacking trips (it is so able to do all this). </p>



<p>You would think a bike like this would roll slow over pavement but the Ogre has been built so it’s not sluggish on pavement or gravel. It really shines when you love those “take-the-long-way-home-and-find-some-beverages-along-the-way” sort of commutes. It is the ideal all year round commuter bike. if you really wanted to on Friday&#8217;s you could cart all the gear you need to work and then head straight out for a weekend trip to be back in time for the Monday clock in.</p>



<p>Surly also has the Troll and ECR in there line up of off-road steeling touring bikes. I would suggests considering these other bikes too. And if you are looking for some guidance <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/surly-troll-vs-ogre-vs-ecr/">I have compared all three bikes here</a>. Hopefully making it easier for you to decide which bike is best for your needs. </p>



<p>So the Ogre comes with clearance for 29” x 2.5” or 27.5&#8243; x 2.8&#8243; tires with fenders. With this bike you do get the Surly Extra Terrestrial 29&#215;2.5” 60TPI Slate-wall Tubeless Ready tires. All the barnacles you could ever possibly ask for including rack and fender, multiple three-pack mounts and mid-blade. And Gnot-Boost rear spacing with Rohloff torque arm slot and Bill/Ted trailer mount. So if you wanted to cart heaps of stiff with a trailer this is so possible with this rig. </p>



<p>The drivetrain is a 1&#215;10 speed Shimano Deore and SRAM NX configuration. Featuring a SRAM NX crank with 32T and the Microshift 10 speed cassette with 11-42t. </p>



<p>Overall this is a confidence inspiring bike that makes riding easy and fun! For the budget friendly price of this bike you can still had more personal upgrades and have a touring/commuter rig that is under $2,000. Some owners of this bike recall not liking the Shimano groupset all that well and either changed it for something like the NX Eagle. Also the rear dropouts have been a slight issue for some too. It is very adaptable to any setup you want, but the rear wheel is hard to keep in line with horizontal dropouts by cranking down on the QR skewer. </p>



<p>Other then that this bike is setup for a great base to the perfect commuter/touring bike. If you are looking to tour and bikepack on this rig for multiple days on end. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-swept-back-handlebars-ultimate-list-of-22-mtb-bars/">Comfortable handlebars</a> are recommended, something like the H Loop Bars. Along with this the bike has ability for racks. So it would be nice to get something like the 24 Pack Front Rack and an everything cage or <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-bikepacking-cargo-cages-dry-bags-bikepacking-fork-cages/">any other cargo cage</a>. Then this would be the ultimate bike to run all your daily errands and head out on tours. </p>



<p>The 2.5 inch tires and steel frame offer comfort and great handling while out riding city streets. Even along alleys / service roads with cracked asphalt and&nbsp;is a joy to ride on gravel. Overall it is a incredibly versatile bike. People have used this rig from world long tours to coffee shop runs and everything in between and the bike just works. It is potentially one of the best do it all bikes. </p>



<p>The frame is made from the Surly 4130 CroMoly steel. Main triangle double-butted and TIG-welded. Along with the Surly Ogre, TIG-welded 4130 CroMoly, non-suspension corrected, tapered and butted straight blade fork. It has low- and mid-blade fully threaded, through-blade rack eyelets; fender mount eyelets at dropout; 1-1/8˝ x 285mm threadless steer tube, 51mm disc mount (203mm max. rotor diameter), line/housing guides; two sets of bottle cage mounts, each height adjustable (note: cages cannot be used on fork with some racks, and vice versa). </p>



<p>You also get the room with a Rohloff OEM2 axle plate mounting slot. Featuring Tektro HD-M275 hydraulic disc brakes. The disc mounts are 51mm IS. Rear disc brake is limited to 160mm maximum rotor diameter and requires the use of Surly caliper adaptor. </p>



<p>Overall for a commuting/touring rig like this you are looking at <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FSurly-Ogre-Bike-2020-29-Steel-Cold-Slate-Blue%3Favad%3D256925_d1a23ba2d">$1450.00 from somewhere like Tree Fort Bikes</a>. This is actually a really good price for a entry level bikepakcing rig that can do so much more then take you on single track. </p>
