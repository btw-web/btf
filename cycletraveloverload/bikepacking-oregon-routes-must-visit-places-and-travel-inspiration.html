<p>Known to be home to the ‘weird’ and wonderful state capital Portland, Oregon has a lot of surprises up it’s sleeves. Whether you only have a week or a month to explore this tantalising state there is always going to be something to tickle your tastebuds. Oregon has everything from beautiful coasts, epic mountain ranges, vast dry desert and deep luscious forests to offer. It also boasts some of the most gruelling single track routes and backcountry mountain biking the nation has. If Oregon wasn’t originally on your bikepacking bucket list then read on and reconsider!</p>



<p>The scenic state of Oregon has some serious natural beauty to behold. The routes we have chosen will take you near or through the magical Columbia River Gorge, glacier capped Mount Hood and evangelical Tumalo Falls. There are so many adventures to be had in the multitude of national parks, your week long bikepacking adventure may take twice as long so you can fit in all the hiking, climbing and paragliding. It can get really cold in the winter and really hot in the summer so we recommend planning your trip for spring time. Most of the routes through the state are paved, gravel or single track so bringing a rigid or hardtail 29er with 2” (or more) wheels will give you the best riding experience. There are campgrounds, lodges and small B&amp;Bs along the routes but be prepared for long stints of ‘nothingness’ and wild camping. </p>



<h2><strong>Routes</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Three Capes &#8211; Tillamook to Pacific City:</strong> This route is part of the Oregon Coastal Route that leaves the crazy Highway 101 behind and allows you to enjoy all the deserted beaches, impressive ocean views and little coastal towns. This route is only around 40 miles long one way so might become a section of a longer ride rather than a bikepacking adventure in itself. Or, you could ride it as a ‘there and back’ staying over in Pacific City and take time to enjoy the beautiful ‘Cape Lookout Trailhead’ hike en route. Make a weekend of it! If you’re willing to nip past the road closures, walk your bike across a few of the beaches and enjoy hiking detours this really is one of the most beautiful West coast rides.</p>

<p><strong>Oregon Timber Trail &#8211; epic cross state : </strong>If you’re a sucker for punishment and want to ride one of the state’s most iconic routes then this 1080km backcountry trail could be for you. With over 20,000m of ascent and estimated to take about a month to ride, this is a gruelling but rewarding mountain biking challenge. It is more than 50% single track which helps to make this one of the most exciting bikepacking trails in the world. It is split up into 4 tiers and 10 segments. It travels through breathtaking mountain ranges, unusual volcanic landscapes, towering forests and picturesque lake vistas. Halfway up the trail you can stop and fully refresh in Oakridge, coined a mountain biker&#8217;s Mecca. Why not down your pack for a day or so and go tearing up the purpose built trails here to break things up. If you are looking for a shorter adventure try taking on one of the tiers. There are plenty of campgrounds along the routes and details of each tier can be found <a href="https://oregontimbertrail.org/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Oregon Outback &#8211; untouched cross state:</strong> Covering the length of the state from Klamath Falls near the California border heading 586km North and 4,382m of elevation to the Columbia River at the Washington border. This has frequently been said to be the most breathtaking bikepacking route in the state. Give yourself a week to complete it and make sure to fully prepare as you could be riding 130kms without a water stop! It will be isolated, desolate and very difficult in parts (it&#8217;s probably best not to mention the ‘Red Sauce Forest’ section). You can enjoy hundreds of kilometres of traffic-free roads and gravel track, just keep an eye out for the rattlesnakes! The terrain varies from mountains to desert, through forests and river gorges just to keep you on your toes. This is a shorter and less well-known cross state route than the Timber trail which could be a good option if you are strapped for time, or don’t fancy all that elevation!</p>

<p><strong>Portland </strong>&#8211; State capital tucked away in the Northwest corner is owning it’s ‘weird’ and hipster persona. It is a quirky city with more strip pubs per capita than anywhere else in the country! If you like breweries, theatres, coffeehouses and bicycle paths then Portland will be right up your street. It is also home to the impressive St. John’s Bridge, ornate Japanese Gardens and an extensive and stunning wine region.</p>

<p><strong>Toketee Falls</strong> &#8211; Oregon’s most famous falls just off Highway 138. There is a tiny hike to see the falls from the viewpoint and is a must see all year round. While you’re in the area you should also check out the Umpqua Hot Springs. Having a bathe in these popular yet still relaxing pools overlooking the Surprise Falls is truly unforgettable.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="515" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15157_1.jpg?resize=720%2C515&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6204" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15157_1.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15157_1.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15157_1.jpg?resize=768%2C549&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15157_1.jpg?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Mount Hood</strong> &#8211; Located 80km Southeast of Portland is this iconic, perpetually snow topped mountain full of adventure. There are easy and challenging hikes, skiing and snowboarding, paragliding and mountain biking to be done on and around this 3,429m high stratovolcano.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="467" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cover-for-Thors-Well.jpg?resize=700%2C467&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6205" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cover-for-Thors-Well.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cover-for-Thors-Well.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cover-for-Thors-Well.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Thor’s Well </strong>&#8211; 120km south of Pacific City you will find this natural phenomenon. At high tide or in stormy weather this rock formation seems to suck the ocean down into oblivion. If you’re trying out the Three Capes ride you could continue further down the coast to explore around here.</p>



<h2><strong>Planning a trip to Oregon</strong></h2>



<p>We could go on and on about the natural beauty Oregon has to offer but this is a good place to start. We think it’s fair to say that Oregon deserves a place on your bucket list. The diversity of terrain certainly has something for every adventure. Make sure you get your map out and prepare fully because there is a lot of magnificent nothingness out there.</p>
