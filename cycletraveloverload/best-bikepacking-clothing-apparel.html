<p>In this blog post we are going to go over some of the best clothing options that you can use for your bikepacking adventures. These have been recommended by others who enjoy bikepacking. With so different types of clothing for summer to winter. </p>



<p>If you are looking for some of the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/complete-list-of-19-bikepacking-shoes-in-2019/">best bikepacking shoes</a> I wrote an earlier blog post that is very popular and people are loving it. I would highly recommend that if you are looking for shoes for bikepacking to <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/complete-list-of-19-bikepacking-shoes-in-2019/">check this blog post out.</a>  Also there is a article all about some of the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-bike-shorts-for-touring-and-bikepacking/">best bike shorts for touring and bikepacking</a> that look really stylish but also act really well functionally for comfort. </p>



<p>We mentioned nothing about bikepacking shoes or boots in this article. But if you are looking for some winter cycling shoes <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-winter-cycling-shoes-boots-2020/">this is a great article</a> to get some ideas. </p>



<p>Personally I love to wear more casual looking clothing when I go on my bike adventures. This means sticking clear away from the tight lycra of road cycling. I just found from some of my first bike tours that cycling in this more traditional road cycling clothing it is uncomfortable over time. Don&#8217;t get me wrong there is always a time and place for lycra, that being &#8220;road cycling&#8221; in the group rides with your buds. I starting riding bikes as a road cyclist. But again for me this type of clothing is a no go for bikepacking and bike touring adventures for many days in the saddle. This post is going to talk mostly about clothing like shirts and jerseys to pants, all the type of clothing and apparel that is more suited to a casual bikepacking approach. </p>



<h3>Flannel Shirts</h3>



<p>We are going to start off with flannel shirts, for me this is a stable clothing item when it comes to bikepacking. I have always taken a button front, long sleeve shirt with me on my adventures. I always like to keep sun smart. These types of shirts are great if you get the good ones. The offer sun protection covering your arms and with a collar I wear it up to add some protection to my neck. It is wise to get a long sleeve shirt like a flannel that is made from a material that is going to be lightweight, pack small, and dry rather quickly. AlthoughI must say sometimes when it is really hot I would rather the short stayed wet all day to keep me cool. But for when it is colder this function is ideal to keep you warm. </p>



<p>Some materials can be rather itchy, heavy and bulky and not the best option for when it comes to bikepacking. Also some shirts when they get used many times over and over they can get rather yuck. Below are some of the better recommendations of bikepacking shirts. </p>



<h4>Search and State Field Shirt</h4>

<p>Is a more sustainable option made in New York. They pride themselves on making sure to look after the people who made the garment to the final product. A garment that is designed to go-everywhere, to take you through life whether you are on or off the bike. It is a brand that at the hear they are about bikes. This shirt is designed to be wrinkly which helps to keep it off your body to provide more airflow which is a genius idea. It is also lighter weight, as they mention over at their website. &#8220;The Field Shirt is a lighter-weight woven cut from a puckered Japanese fabric&nbsp;made up of blended yarns that create a consistent, and permanent, textured surface that prevent the cloth from lying flat on your skin while you are riding.&#8221; <a href="https://searchandstate.com/products/field-shirt">Read more here</a> For $145.00</p>

<h3>Other Tops (Jackets, Hoodies, Jersey, shirts etc..)</h3>

<p>Appalachian Gear Company have the All-Paca hoodie which is another item that has won awards. Available in three colors it is a hoodie that almost gives off some Swanndri vibes. If you know this New Zealand brand they seem similar to a lumberjacket, bush style hoodie, which I kind of like. This fleece hoodie is made from 100% Alpaca Fiber and is super lightweight, breathable, and packable. originally designed for backpacking and climbing they have had weigh in mind and it is rather warm for its lightweight. Most backpacking gear is generally a good fit for bikepacking as this is a more new activity when compared. So products are still being developed to suit this niche. This hoodie still does a great job. Not a bulky garment and the Alpaca Fiber doesn’t absorb much moisture, and it dries really quickly.

<p>Are you after a super lightweight and small space packing rain jacket that is going to keep you dry but pack so small? This is a hard ask in the world of bikepacking but I think I found a solution. This jacket is made with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.montbell.us/about/technical-info/materials/gore-tex/">GORE-TEX</a>&nbsp;Shake Dry technology. Shake Dry is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.montbell.us/about/technical-info/materials/gore-tex/">GORE-TEX</a>&#8216;s concept of taking the waterproof/breathable membrane and putting it on the outer layer of the jacket&#8217;s fabric. As a result you get a jacket with a surface fabric that permanently beads water, eliminating the need for durable water repellent treatments. Even when you are riding fast it is going to do a excellent job with breathability and keeping you dry and comfortable.

<p>They say merino wool is one of the better materials to use for bikepacking. Back in the day wool was the material of choice for cycling clothes but today synthetic materials are more popular. However wool is somewhat still popular today with some bikepackers and it has some really great features. They are great at moisture control and a resistance to smelly armpits! This long sleeve jersey is made from medium-weight Merino wool. Merino fibers are soft and non-irritating even on sensitive skin. The fabric weight makes them suitable for cool weather to cold weather. You get a high collar to help keep the cold out and the warm in, and feature long body and long sleeve. And you also get some rear pockets with zippers for some storage options. I like this jersey as it is not too &#8216;Tour de France&#8217; like, a lot more casual for my liking. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FSurly-Merino-Mens-Long-Sleeve-Jersey-Black-Medium%3Favad%3D225245_e18e0302d%26rpi%3D176717%26utm_medium%3DAVLK">Priced from $140 at Jenson USA</a></p>

<p>Patagonia&#8217;s new Merino Bike Jersey is a clean and simple T-shirt silhouette, made with a blend of fine merino wool and recycled polyester for soft, quick-wicking next-to-skin temperature control. Fair Trade Certified™ sewn.  I like this shirt style as it has slightly longer sleeves for more protection. Weighing in at 142 grams and does not have any tags at neck for itch-free comfort. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=50d08f80-6a3b-4a15-90d3-1b7c09b770b0&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patagonia.com%2Fproduct%2Fmens-short-sleeved-merino-bike-jersey%2F23925.html%3Favad%3D225245_d18deb715%26netid%3D1%26pubid%3D176717%26utm_source%3Dwww.bikepacking.com%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_campaign%3DCustom%2BLink%26src%3Dcl%26src%3Davl">Priced at $89.00</a></p>



<h3>Bottoms (Shorts and Pants)</h3>



<p>Just a quick reminder that is you have not already checked out the best shorts bikepacking article I wrote that is rather popular, <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-bike-shorts-for-touring-and-bikepacking/">you can view it here</a>. Most of the shorts are over there so this post will not really be including any shorts to save posting the same stuff all over again. </p>

<p>These are some of the best bad weather pants out there. They are designed as mountain biker pants, perfect for the playfully insane and long distance tourers. With a 3/4 length styling making them great for those who heat up too much in normal rain pants, but still want that breathability. The deisgn helps to avoid chain suck and reduces bulk when stashed, allowing you to pack them away rather small which is perfect for bikepacking and the limited space. The 3 layer HydroFoil™ Plus&nbsp;fabric shields your thighs from deluges and your bum from rear wheel splatter. Priced from $199.00 NZD, you can <a href="https://www.groundeffect.co.nz/products/helter-skelters-waterproof-rain-pants">find out more here.</a> </p>



<h3>Socks</h3>



<p>Yeah I guess you could just wear any socks and be on your way, they are nit the most important piece if gear to really think to much about before going out and getting some. But I have recommended two pairs down below if you are interested. You want to avoid thick socks that are not breathable, you feet are going to stink and it will be rather uncomfortable. Materials like merino or linen are a good place to start. Wait! Can you even get linen socks?</p>



<h4>Surly Logo Wool Socks</h4>

<p>My top pick would have to be the Surly socks, big fan of Surly here! So it is no surprise! I guess brand name wins here for me. All the Surly&nbsp;socks are made by DeFeet and&nbsp;have a 5&#8243; cuff height. They&#8217;re made from Merino wool, so they don&#8221;t build up stink as badly or quickly as other fabrics. Priced at $19.00 you can <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=422569d4-5a20-4645-8407-c0d2992166c3&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treefortbikes.com%2FSurly-Logo-5-Wool-Socks%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle%26avad%3D225245_e18e02ebd">pick them up from Tree Fort Bikes here.</a></p>
