<p>So fat bikes are very unique and if you are looking for racks to turn your fat bike into the most epic adventure rig. This is one of the best ways to turn them in to an ultimate adventure bike. As fat bikes can take you places where other bikes are unable. If you are looking for rear racks for fat bikes <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/rear-racks-for-fat-bikes/">I have published a in-depth article</a> talking about some of your best options. This is where I touch on the things to consider when choosing a rear rack for fat bikes and the same characteristics apply for front fat bike racks. I would suggest giving that article a read for some more information. </p>



<p>One of the main things that matters most with front racks for fat bikes is compatibility. As a lot of bikes have different mounting position on the forks and racks will differ. </p>



<p>As I mention in the other article weight doesn&#8217;t really matter as much with fat bike packing and touring. As fat bikes in general are not that fats in the first place. And for example some of the environments you are riding are slow like a sandy dessert track. </p>



<p>Wheel size is also something to consider, not all racks will accommodate all fat bike tire widths. It is best if you read the racks product description it will indicate weather the rack will fit certain sized tires. Then you will be able to see if the rack will have the vertical and horizontal clearance needed. </p>



<p>Also consider weight limits, for my riding style I prefer less weight on the front racks, but some say bikes ride better when more weight is at the front. Make sure you double check the front racks weight limit and it works with the amount of weight you plan to carry at the front.  </p>



<h4><a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-fat-bikes-for-bikepacking-in-2020/">Wanna Get Some Ideas Of The Best Fat Bikes?</a></h4>



<p>So here are some of the best front racks for fat bikes, in no particular order. I here some stories of people bending normal sized front racks to bend around the fat tires of the bike. And personally I don&#8217;t like this idea. I have concerns for strength of the rack once bent and racks should not be something that you mess about with. As it is super dangerous, and you really don&#8217;t want a rack snapping and cause trouble catching on your wheels. So I tried my best to find racks that are fat bike specific or if they are not still have enough clearance for fat bikes and don&#8217;t require risky modifications, such as bending rack tubing to work around the tires. </p>



<h2>Blackburn Fat Bike Rack</h2>

So you will be able to fit tires sizes that are 26″, 650B, 700c, 27.5″ and 29″ with widths from 23C up to 3″. <strong>It fits tires sizes from 26″ X 1″ UP TO 29″X 4″.</strong></p>

<h2>Pelago Commuter Front Rack</h2>

<p>If you are after a more commuter style front rack for your fat bike. I would probably not recommend this for expedition tours. But just for carting gear to a trail or down to the local market. It is important to note that it is not specifically designed for ft bikes. But made to fit &#8220;most bikes&#8221;. You also get additional attachment points for panniers. If you are responsible for weekend pizza runs, this rack has you covered! </p>



<p>The rack is constructed of stainless steel, which makes it light and durable. The Commuter Front Rack is available in two sizes and both polished or black. The versatile attachment options make the rack easy to install and it fits most bicycles with 26” or 28” wheels. And also comes with a mounting piece for a front light. The rack has a 15 kg max load capacity. And <a href="https://www.pelagobicycles.com/pelago-commuter-front-rack.html">is priced at €99.00 or around just over $100.00</a></p>
