<p>So are you looking for some swept back handlebars? Some bicycle handlebars for sitting upright? This article includes some of the best options if you want the best posture and comfort on bike. Especially if you plan some extended multiple day bikepacking trips these types of handlebars can be a real benefit for your back. </p>



<p>Swept back handlebars are commonly found on beach cruisers but are getting popular for use when you need a comfortable MTB handlebar or an alternative to dropbars on road bikes. While also they do make a good change for a touring bike also. There are so many comfort handlebar options out there. Not just swept back bars. There are <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/gravel-bike-handlebars-best-flared-drop-bars/">Gravel Bike Handlebars</a> which are still dropbars, but &#8216;Flared&#8217; Drop Bars. Or you can get the low down on <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-bike-touring-and-bikepacking-handlebars-everything-you-need-to-know/">Best Bike Touring and Bikepacking Handlebars</a>. What about the Butterfly Handlebars? They are one of my favourites when it comes to comfort. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/trekking-bars-butterfly-handlebars-review-my-experience-after-5000-km/">Read my 7,500+ KM handlebar review here</a>. </p>



<p>It is also worth noting before you go out and buy any of the recommended swept back handlebars in this article. To consider your current bike setup and if you get these type of bars. You may need to alter it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong you can go ahead and customise your bike. But most parts on a bike work together so you will most likely never change just one part. Plan on having to buy new longer cables and housings. Potentially new brake levers, shifters and hand grips. Since your hand position is being moved so much, your stem, the part that holds your handlebar onto the rest of the bike, might need a change too. Stems come in lots of different lengths and rises and getting that combination just right is really important.</p>



<h3>Why Swept Back Handlebars?</h3>



<p>Maybe you have been riding flat bars on all your bikes for years. And now you are starting to get bad back pain due to the position your current bars put you in. And you are now looking for some alternative for better posture and take less pain &#8216;off your back&#8217;. Overall they offer a more relaxed seated position while cycling and they make a great handlebar option for long bike tours especially when the road becomes trails and mountain bike style of riding. </p>



<p>There are quiet a lot of swept back handlebars or comfortable riser MTB handlebars on the market. Really too many to mention. However I am going to try my best to list and briefly talk about as many as possible. Keep in mind that all of these have been recommended by other bike riders weather that be for bikepacking or general use as a MTB handlebar. </p>



<h2>Surly Moloko</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Handlebars_1500x1000-1.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4880" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Handlebars_1500x1000-1.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Handlebars_1500x1000-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Handlebars_1500x1000-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Handlebars_1500x1000-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Handlebars_1500x1000-1.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Handlebars_1500x1000-1.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>These bars have been on the list of my &#8216;must try&#8217; handlebars. Yes that is right I have a list of the bars I need to test out and use in my life. Like I mentioned earlier you can click through and see my thoughts on the bars I have currently been using and like. But I love Surly as a brand and am a big fan of their bikes. Which is why the Moloko bars are up here. I have also met some bikepackers who use them on their rigs. The main reason is so they get better posture and it helped with back issues putting the body in that upright posture. </p>



<p>Not only do you get that back sweep positioning but also you get a multitude of hand positions. making it great for long days on the saddle giving you the option to change your hands and feel more comfortable. Along with this you also get many spots to mount your accessories and the option for handlebar bags. The bar comes in 735mm but if 685mm is more your style, don’t you worry. Surly added cut marks so you can easily make it so. You get a sweep of 34 degrees and the bar totals weight come sin at 709 grams. </p>



<h2>Velo Orange Crazy Bar</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="441" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC00156_1_-2-1.jpg?resize=720%2C441&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4883" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC00156_1_-2-1.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC00156_1_-2-1.jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC00156_1_-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C471&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC00156_1_-2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C628&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC00156_1_-2-1.jpg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC00156_1_-2-1.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>A much similar designed bar by Velo Orange is the Crazy Bar. This is also another option. These bars are intended for touring on paved and unpaved roads, single and double track, gravel and crushed limestone, and everything in between. When you are up against rough sections the swept back position provides good control. And the bullhorns offer streamlined positing for smooth roads. </p>



<p>The main bar uses a 22.2mm grip area so MTB grips, levers, and shifters fit. The &#8220;horns&#8221; are 23.8mm, so road&nbsp;components such as inverse brake levers and bar-end shifters are compatible.&nbsp;Stem clamp area is&nbsp;31.8mm. They are made from a heat treated 6061 aluminum. Weight comes in at around 470 grams, with a 666 mm width and 45 deg swept. </p>



<h2>Moonmen Moonriser Bar</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="372" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0249.jpeg?resize=720%2C372&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4884" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0249.jpeg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0249.jpeg?resize=300%2C155&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DSC_0249.jpeg?resize=50%2C26&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Do you want to bring a bit more BMX to your trail riding? Well this bar can deliver just that! A handlebar made from titanium that combines function and form, for a comfortable ride. There is heaps of room on the cross bar for GPS and other gadgets. Or if you dig that old school look you can add a handlebar pad, which brings back some cool memories. </p>



<p>The standard version is 32.75”/830mm wide (Cut-able to 30”), 4&#8243; rise, 24˚ back sweep, 5 degree up sweep, 22.2mm tube diameter with shims to take it to 31.8mm stem clamp. </p>

<p>Another Surly bar! They describe this bar as a cruiser bar, a trail bar and a BMX bar all rolled into one. More designed for a relaxed cruise. Maybe not the best option out of this list but something to consider. </p>

<p>A very useful handlebar for bikepacking that is also on the budget side compared to something like the Jones Loop. more on that one later. With the Origin8 Strongbow you get multiple hand positions. It is very comfortable and ergonomic with a 15 degrees sweep. They also offer some comfort and support while attacking steep downhills too. </p>



<p>A cool feature is the front bar on this handlebar that is great for mounting a handlebar bag but also keeps it away from the break cables. The handlebars are definitely wide enough at 760 mm and you also get an additional 120 mm of reach with hands on the front bar in an aero position. </p>



<h2>Jones Loop H Bar</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="251" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LoopSGfullbig__25320.1489433737.jpeg?resize=720%2C251&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4888" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LoopSGfullbig__25320.1489433737.jpeg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LoopSGfullbig__25320.1489433737.jpeg?resize=300%2C105&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LoopSGfullbig__25320.1489433737.jpeg?resize=768%2C268&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LoopSGfullbig__25320.1489433737.jpeg?resize=1024%2C357&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LoopSGfullbig__25320.1489433737.jpeg?resize=50%2C17&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>

<p>The Osprey Bar is classified as a alternative MTB handlebar similar to Soma&#8217;s Clarence Bar. However this bar has a little more backsweep in the grip and a wider straight section in the middle, then the two. This wider straight section helps with mounting much more accessories and handlebar bags. And plus you get many different hand positions.

<p>Another custom backsweep handlebar builder is Watson Cycles these guys have 4 handlebar options, as seen above. The Ti Bars are hand-made one at a time. They were developed with specific bends to address the pain related issues that come with the rigors of mountain biking. The Titanium build helps to dampen the ride quality and smooth out the terrain minimizing vibration and therefore, fatigue. The Parkarino bar provides the largest backsweep at 31 degrees and 720 mm of width. It is the bar that started it all for the Watson Ti bars. </p>

<p>Had the pleasure to chat to Alee a while back and got to meet the man behind these bars. He is a true legend and I am inspired what he is doing in this industry! The Denham Bars are a calibration with him &#8220;Alee Denham&#8221; and Koga! Alees three most important characteristics for a touring bar are; bike control, comfort and speed. And it is safe to say that they came up with a truely awesome handlebar!</p>

<p>When Stooge were thinking about making these bars they realised that most MTB handlebars at the time had not enough backsweep. The speed and control this bar provides really is outstanding, with a hand position that is so natural and comfortable.

The wide clamp area is designed to provide plenty of space to strap bags and other accessories for those long haul adventures. It is made from a heat treated 7050 alloy, 800mm wide, 38mm rise, 17 degree sweep, black anodizing with laser etched ‘Stooge’ logo. 31.8 clamp area. And weighs 340 grams. </p>
