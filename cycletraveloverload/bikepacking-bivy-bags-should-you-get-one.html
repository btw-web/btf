<p>I have been looking into getting a bivy bag for my bikepacking adventures for a little while now. I currently have a one person tent. And too be honest I am leaning more towards the idea of a bivy as it is generally lighter weight then almost all tents. But there are few things that you should really consider if you are interested in making the leap. </p>



<p>Bivy&#8217;s are pretty popular in audax cycling events. Like the inside space of a bivy is not that big at all. If you are one for claustrophobia you might have to skip over this entire blog article. They are super lightweight which is one of the main reasons some bikepackers go for them. But you get very little room to move about. And if you are bike touring and have more gear that you would potentially like to store inside your tent for the night. Well it would be even tighter in a bivy. Maybe not even possible at all. Which is why I am suggesting them for bikepacking as you have very minimal gear to begin with, so there is no real need to be storing it in the bivy only the essentials which are typically small anyway. </p>



<p>Ideally most bivy bags are not the best in warmer or more humid environments as the less airflow inside the bivy can heat up. Which is what makes them perfect for colder times of the year. That air gets trapped and circulates through the bivy keeping you warm. this is the ideal case to be using a bivy bag when bikepacking. </p>



<p>For example I used an emergency bivy that we got from the Uk for fairly cheap. To be honest i only thing it is suppose to be used a handful of times. However I use it every night I go bikepacking. And it still to this day works fine. Very light weight and is essentially a very thin sleeping bag with a draw string close hood. And does a very good job in keeping the cold air out and waterproofing me. Really got a chance to test it out one night. When we where camping on a play ground of all things. On this teepee shaped structure that leaked like a sieve. It stormed all night but I was dry as a bone. </p>



<p>So there are some trade-offs for the extreme packability of a bivy. Some have a problem where it can condense make your sleeping bag wet when the sleeping bag is touching. Which is obviously not a good thing when you want to keep warm and dry. </p>



<p>But it really comes to the point where you are cutting very small margenial weight for a bivy compared to a super light tent, like the Nemo Hornet which is a packed weight of 2 pounds or 905 grams or you can get the two person option which would be so much more comfortable then a bivy for 1.08 kg. Then for comparison you have a bivy like the Black DiamondBipod Bivy Shelter which is a total weight of 892 grams. And they are around the same price, the bivy being slightly cheaper. When looking at these two it really doesn&#8217;t make sense to go for a bivy at the moment. Is saving a few 100 grams of weight really worth it?</p>



<p>This brings me back to my emergency bivy bag. If you really want to go light you could get something like that are just use your sleeping bag, mat and that bivy and it would weight almost nothing. Then you are just laying on the ground. it is a option if you want to go super-duper light. </p>



<p>It is important to look at what doesn&#8217;t work for using a bivy when bikepacking, hopefully this helps you make a more informed discussion. because at the beginner of writing this article I was all for them, but at the moment I am not sure. Really painting a bad light on them. but wait we will get the the reasons why you may want to consider a bivy soon.</p>



<p>Again as I mentioned before they really lack in not having  space for storage. You may not think that’s important until you have to camp somewhere that is a bit sketchy. And you suddenly wish you had your panniers or all your gear beside you. </p>



<p>The confined space is what most people don&#8217;t like about bivy&#8217;s it is some confined that you are not even able to read a book or change clothes when it is raining outside. </p>



<p>There are a few solutions to some of the cons to use a bivy that are been mentioned above. Some use a bivy and a tarp setup. Which works great, allowing for a shelter that you could get out of the bivy and still have some coverage for getting changed or moving about to stretch, read a book or even some dinner while laying down. Plus this setup is still considerably lightweight. </p>



<p>Bivy&#8217;s are great if you want to blend in with your surroundings and be super stealth. My emergency bivy is a dark green and when laying down on the ground completely covered by the bivy you could mistaken me for some shrub. Along with that they also add some extra warmth to your sleeping bag. You can however feel a little vulnerable when using them as there is not much too them compared to a two person tent. </p>



<p>You may want to consider a Hammock/bivy this seems more practical then just a stand alone bivy. As well it is a Hammock to! And lets face it hammocks are really cool. </p>



<p>It must be mentioned also that pole bivy&#8217;s weight just about the same as a small tent. But one of the main benefits to a bivy, especially the really lightweight ones is the weight. they can be so much lighter, getting under a kilo for a tent costs money, and then you have a tent that weighs as much as a heavy bivi setup. Then someone points you in the direction of a 180g bivi bag and cuben tarp that together weigh less than a can of coke including a pole and pegs. That is what to me makes a bivy more appealing. </p>



<p>But then again the more I look into it the more I realise that a bivy is not really the best buy. With the new generations of quality ultralight tents, bivy&#8217;s are just history. The new ultralight tents, are as light and as packable as bivy&#8217;s and not more expensive, a no brainer choice</p>



<p>In my opinion I would opt for a lightweight bikepacking tent. I have written this <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/complete-list-of-40-best-bikepacking-tents/">complete list of bikepacking tents</a> article about some of the best lightweight tents that you can use for your next bikepacking adventure. Bivy&#8217;s unfortunately, for me, can&#8217;t beat the comfort that comes with a tent, being able to sit up and more about without being confined like in a bivy is just the best. </p>
