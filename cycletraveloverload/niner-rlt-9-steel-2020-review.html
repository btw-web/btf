<p>This is one of the most adventurous gravel bikes you can get on the market today and it is one of those bikes that gets me excited every time I get the chance to talk about it. Right off the bat if you dig the classic aesthetics of smooth, supple steel and you wish to ride both a combination of pavement or gravel road. Designed for all day comfort, confidence and control, You can trust this bike to be a great fit for most bikepacking adventures that require extended and long days in the saddle. This is a bike that is perfect for you! It just craves long adventures. </p>

<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="The 2020 Niner Bikes RLT 9 Steel" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vrJ-_PFZLc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>More on comfort the RLT 9 has a longer chain-stay, a lower bottom bracket height and slacker head-tube angle to keep you more comfortable. Whether you are riding around town or across the country. </p>



<h3>Go Further </h3>



<p>Speaking about going further the Niner RLT 9 Steel has quiet a few frame features fit for just that. This dream build has over 26 mounting points! Yes that is right! That is for the 2020 models I believe I am not sure if the previous 2019 and early models have this many. Looking at some of the option for sale they don&#8217;t have some at the bottom of the top tube like the 2020 models do. This gives you the option to outfit your bike with as many bags, bottles, and racks as your heart desires. </p>



<p>Also they have designed custom frame bags that fit perfectly, and fasten without the use of straps, making a clean looking bikepacking setup. The bike also features internal cable routing which also helps in making it look rather tidy. With the PF30 bottom bracket shell you can fit a single speed gearing if you really desire. And the ability to fit mechanical or electronic shifting and even a dropper post too. </p>



<h3>Niner RLT 9 Tire Size</h3>



<p>One thing I love in a good gravel/adventure bike is the ability to fit wider tires. Anything that is 45c or more is my cup of tea! With the RLT 9 you get the option to fit a max tire clearance up to 700x50c. There is no worries if you wish to swap tire sizes also. As this rig can accomodate 650b wheels and fit tires as wide as 2.0. </p>



<h3>Let&#8217;s Talk Frame Build!</h3>



<p>So the frame and fork of this RLT? Well this is the bases of a great bike. When it comes to the RLT you get a steel frame and carbon fork combination. Which gives you the strength of steel and the supple and comfort of carbon on the rough stuff. The steel used for this bike is Reynolds 853 steel and Niner say that this is, &#8220;a nearly perfect material for creating bike frames&#8221;. And after they TIG weld the bike, the frame tube junctions actually strengthen rather then being weakened by heat. </p>



<p>Steel frames in general have a well-earned reputation for rugged, dependable reliability. Steel has a way of brushing off the inevitable scratches, dings, and rough treatment that accompanies the best adventures. I personally have a love of steel frame bikes. All the adventure bikes I have ever owned are steel, like the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/surly-long-haul-trucker-review-over-10000-km-ridden/">Surly Long Haul Trucker</a> and the <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/kona-sutra-ltd-review-bikepacking-bike/">Kona Sutra LTD 2020!</a></p>



<p>With the combination of steel you get a RDO carbon fiber fork. So what is RDO it is short for Race Day Optimized carbon fiber. Which is built with a unique process that optimizes complete compaction of the carbon layers under heat and pressure. The fork is light and stiff while improving compliance over rough surfaces. </p>



<h3>My Favourite Version Of The Niner RLT 9</h3>

<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-background has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color" href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FNiner-RLT-9-Steel-Rival-1X-Jenson-USA-Exclusive-Build">Read More</a></div>



<p>There are 4 versions of the Niner RLT 9 Steel 2020 coming in a range of different prices and component combinations. You get to choose from 2-STAR, 3-STAR, 4-STAR and 5-STAR. Which I will get into more detail soon. But my personal favourite because of price and looks is the RLT 9 with the Rival 1 option which is a Jenson USA Exclusive Build and to make things sweater it is the most budget friendly option out of all the other versions of this bike. But it is important to note that I don&#8217;t think this Jenson Exclusive Build is a 2020 model as it is the bike as I mentioned earlier that has some subtle differences. Like less mounting points on the frame as the 2020 models do. And I am also not sure but I believe this bike has slightly less tire clearance at 45mm</p>



<p>So the price for this bike is <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FNiner-RLT-9-Steel-Rival-1X-Jenson-USA-Exclusive-Build">$2,299.99</a> which is about $400 cheaper then the 2-Star 2020 model. And you get a nice SRAM Rival group-set with a 1&#215;11 which is the most popular variation for gravel bikes alike. And there is just something about the aesthetics of a 1&#215;11 setup to makes me froth!! The bike also comes with a PG1130 cassette has an 11-42-tooth gear range that makes climbing a breeze and makes it easy to ride in rough terrain without sacrificing top-end speed. SRAM provides the brakes with their Rival hydraulic disc brakes that provide ample braking power so you can descend with confidence. </p>



<p>Some customers of the specific build have said; &#8220;Niner reputation. Steel frame for endurance/longevity and comfort. Good value. Bypass bike store (i.e. buy direct).&#8221;</p>
