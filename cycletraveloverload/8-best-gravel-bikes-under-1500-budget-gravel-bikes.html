So in this article we are focusing on the best gravel bikes between the budget of $1000 to $1500. If you have not all ready, I would suggest checking out the $1000 or under list as there is some great gravel bikes there for budget prices.</p>

<p>I was searching all the web for the best gravel bikes under $1500 and all I could find was a couple blog articles that listed 5 bikes that were all available on amazon. And to be honest it was safe to say these blogs were just finding bikes on Amazon that they could sell for affiliate commission to make money. Some of the bikes were not even gravel bikes and are so bad that it makes me wonder how they even got in a list of the &#8220;best&#8221; gravel bikes. </p>

<p>So instead I spent some time researching the best gravel bikes that I would personally love to own and the great thing is they are all under $1,500. They are in no particular order. Please keep in mind that some of these bikes have a retail price that is over $1,500 but the links to stores for where you can find the bikes for sale are under $1,500 due to sales and finding the cheapest price for you. Having that said it is subject to availability and limited sizes, so I cannot guarantee that these deals will stay around for too long. </p>

<h3><strong>Diamondback Bicycles Haanjo 3</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="416" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-24.jpeg?resize=720%2C416&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3743" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-24.jpeg?w=729&amp;ssl=1 729w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-24.jpeg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-24.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This gravel grinder just missed out on a spot in the best gravel bikes under $1000. Well I guess it could have <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=385e3a5e-b0ab-4773-8c11-5bce310af637&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.diamondback.com%2Fhaanjo3">but at $1000 it is a great budget gravel bike option.</a> It is described as a “road bike” that can handle so much more than “road riding.” It is designed to handle any kind of road — paved or not. Which is the essences of a gravel grinder. </p>



<p>One of the things that caught my eye with this bike is the curve on the top-tube. For a cheap price it comes with sophistication. In the detail of design in the frame and paint work. The bike is built around a relaxed road frame geometry that gives you the option to fit wider tires. Up to 700x45mm or 650&#215;2.1 inches wide. The bike comes stock with WTB Riddler Comp, 700x37c tires. </p>



<p>This bike is suited best for mid-level riders. The components are on the low end on this bike, but they still preform rather well. This bike comes with 2×9 Shimano Sora&nbsp;drivetrain with 46/30T cogs in the front, and an 11-32T cassette in the rear. Which is a nice combination when riding on gravel and off-road sections. </p>



<p>The bike comes with three mounting points for bottle cages. And you get a eyelet on either side of the fork, plus braise ons for a rear rack. So if you wanted you could use this for some fun bikepacking or off-road touring adventures. </p>

<h3>2020 Giant Toughroad SLR GX 1</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="424" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-25.jpeg?resize=720%2C424&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3745" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-25.jpeg?w=721&amp;ssl=1 721w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-25.jpeg?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/images-25.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Toughroad is a great all round adventure bike. Coming in a variety of options, with a flat bar or drop. You can get it with front and rear racks for a pannier setup if you like. But the SLR GX 1 makes a great gravel bike too. To be honest when I got started in the cycling I wish a bike like this was around at the time.  At the time when I purchased my first bike it was a road bike. But for something like this Giant it is so much more value for money, with the wide range of use this bike can undertake. Not just a gravel bike, it can be so much more. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://mailchi.mp/721036779ceb/freedownload"><img loading="lazy" width="559" height="139" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/best-gravel-bikes-under-1500-1.png?resize=559%2C139&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3758" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/best-gravel-bikes-under-1500-1.png?w=559&amp;ssl=1 559w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/best-gravel-bikes-under-1500-1.png?resize=300%2C75&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/best-gravel-bikes-under-1500-1.png?resize=50%2C12&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></figure></div>



<p>This Giant is made from a frameset constructed with ALUXX SLR, the lightest grade of aluminum, and a composite fork. With the 2020 option you get high-volume 50c Giant tubeless tires. Which is probably not the best for just general gravel and road use. But perfect for adventuring into the wilderness. These tires allow you to run lower tire pressure for comfort and traction plus a reduced risk of flat tires. </p>



<p>The bike features a neat design called the X-Defender Frame Protection. Which acts as a guard for the frame and rider from dirt and rocks while providing smooth cable routing for adventurous riding. The overall cable routing of the bike is hidden and looks clean. The bike also features a D-Fuse seatpost, which is designed to dampen vibrations, resulting in a smooth, compliant ride. <a href="https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/toughroad-slr-gx-1-2020">Available from $1,270</a></p>



<h3>2019 Trek Checkpoint AL4</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1440" height="869" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CheckpointAL4_19_24971_B_Primary.jpeg?fit=640%2C386&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3749" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CheckpointAL4_19_24971_B_Primary.jpeg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CheckpointAL4_19_24971_B_Primary.jpeg?resize=300%2C181&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CheckpointAL4_19_24971_B_Primary.jpeg?resize=768%2C463&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CheckpointAL4_19_24971_B_Primary.jpeg?resize=1024%2C618&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CheckpointAL4_19_24971_B_Primary.jpeg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>I would have loved to have got the new 2020 AL4 into this list but it is just $100 out of this lists budget. <a href="http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=0d15472d-796a-41f7-afb4-32437118891b&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fbikes%2Froad-bikes%2Fgravel-bikes%2Fcheckpoint%2Fcheckpoint-al%2Fcheckpoint-al-4%2Fp%2F24971%2F">But you can pick up the 2019 model from $1,479.99 at Trek. </a></p>



<p>Trek call this the &#8220;ideal entry point to the world of gravel riding&#8221;. The reason why this is one of the better gravel bikes is the quality of construction and components. Featuring a 200 Alpha Series Aluminum frame that is designed with sophisticated tubing shapes for weight and maximum strength. Paired with a lightweight fork with carbon fibre legs which helps soak up rough road vibrations. </p>



<p>The bike features a Shimano Tiagra, 50/34 compact crank. The higher you go up in price from $1000 the more the gravel bikes look sleek and clean, with internal cable routing. Like with this Trek, it has, a &#8216;Control Freak Cable Management&#8217; system. Which allows any combination of shift, brake, lockout, and dropper post lines to pass through the frame for a custom looking setup. </p>



<p>Hiding away it has some fender mounts that you will not even notice if you don&#8217;t use fenders. But if you want some ideas on some of the best fenders and mudguards for gravel bikes, there is a a write up here. The bike is also DuoTrap S compatible. Which seamlessly integrates a bluetooth or ANT+ sensor into the frame, with no effect on aerodynamics. Giving you the option to measure speed, distance and cadence. </p>



<p>With the frame you do get a okay tire clearance, but the bike only comes with 700&#215;32 Bontrager R1 Hard-Case Lite tires. Depending on the type of riding you intend to do with this bike. If you are looking for a bike with 45 or more you might need to look elsewhere. The 32&#8217;s might not be adequate. But still fine for light gravel. This bike is great for a wide variety of ride styles, including gravel rides, bikepacking, and daily commutes. </p>



<h3>2020 Cannondale Topstone Sora</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="418" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/naxrnof3sl3cjwtymnl8.png?resize=720%2C418&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3750" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/naxrnof3sl3cjwtymnl8.png?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/naxrnof3sl3cjwtymnl8.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/naxrnof3sl3cjwtymnl8.png?resize=768%2C445&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/naxrnof3sl3cjwtymnl8.png?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This Cannondale gravel bike is one of my favourite in the list for its aesthetics, it looks really nice! That &#8216;Mantis&#8217; dark green just makes you want to get one and go explore the deep corners of a forest! It is a bike that is born to roll and roam.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Pure gravel goodness. With its high-volume tires, confident rider position and sporty handling, Topstone is ready to smash out big miles on the backroads, explore routes less traveled, or smooth out the chop on your morning commute.</p><cite>Cannondale</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you have the budget for a more expensive bike from $1,750 you can pick up a womens and mens option with a Shimano 105 groupset. Otherwise <a href="https://www.evanscycles.com/cannondale-topstone-al-sora-2020-gravel-bike-EV360817">this Sora option comes in at $1,250.</a> The Topstone name came from a favorite dirt road loop near the Cannondale headquarters in Connecticut. With this bike you get the ability to add up to 42mm tires for comfort, grip and adventurous capability. The bike does come with WTB Riddler Comp, 700 x 37c tires. </p>

<p>The Topstone shares similar stack and reach measurements with the Cannondale synapse Endurance bikes. Which offers a confident riding position. A Full carbon fork, with tapered steerers and 12mm thruaxles, for a light, comfortable and precise-steering front end. You also get room to store three water bottles, plus mounts for top tube storage. </p>

<p>A superb looking bike, the Genesis Fugio 20 actually has a retail price of $1,994 but at the time of writing this list I was able to find it <a href="https://www.evanscycles.com/genesis-fugio-20-2019-gravel-bike-EV360708">for sale for 30% off at Evans Cycles at </a><strong><a href="https://www.evanscycles.com/genesis-fugio-20-2019-gravel-bike-EV360708">$1,410.50</a></strong>. You might get lucky and find some other deals. If you can this would make a bike of great value. This bike is probably number one for me as far as looks go maybe just ahead of the Topstone. The spec level on this bike is up in that $2,000 category so to get it for under $1,500 is a really great deal!</p>



<p>It is a steel framed bike with a aluminum fork. One of the three steel gravel bike options in this list. The next two are also steel options. Perfect if you don&#8217;t mind that little extra weight for a bit more strength and durability. </p>



<p>It is the only bike in the list with a Shram setup, making it the best specced out bike in this list. As mentioned before this is no surprise as it is originally priced at just under $2,000. </p>



<p>If you check out the free download of the comparison guide. I included with this post, where I go into detail of all these 8 bikes and look at specs and much more about the bikes. With the gear range chart you see that it is rather limited in comparison to other bikes in this list. Especially with descending speeds, due to the 1X11 speed. Also comes with 12mm thru axles front and rear, full internal Di2 and dynamo routing, three bottle cage eyelets and some Clement X&#8217;Plor MSO 50c tires. </p>



<p>It is a great quality bike, but unfortunately it does lack a little in performance. Making it only really good for gravel, it is a good option if you are looking for a mountain bike that had dropbars.  </p>



<h3>2019 Masi CXGR Expert</h3>

<p>This Masi is a high quality gravel grinder. Made from a tig-welded double butted Columbus CROMOR chromoly frame and a Carbon fork for extra suppleness. Masi should get some style points for the green paint and the yellow handle grips. </p>



<p>Users of the bike have reported that the ride is really fast and smooth. The carbon fork is also stiff and light. The bike comes with Shimano Tiagra R4700 drivetrain&nbsp;which helps shifting more smoothly and reliably. You get the option to mount fenders and racks for touring trips if you wish. </p>



<p>The CXGR comes with Tubeless ready wheels&nbsp;for a smoother ride and better traction. They are Kenda Flintridge 700x40mm.

<h3>Masi Giramondo 27.5 Bike 2019</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1110" height="624" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bi170c17-camper-blue.jpg?fit=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3740" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bi170c17-camper-blue.jpg?w=1110&amp;ssl=1 1110w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bi170c17-camper-blue.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bi170c17-camper-blue.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bi170c17-camper-blue.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bi170c17-camper-blue.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>Out of all the bikes in this list, the Masi Giramondo is the best on paper when it comes to climbing. Although it is heavier as a all steel bike. It offers a useful 3&#215;10 speed setup making it a monster for climbing. A highly versatile bike with a more traditional touring bike design with simple cable routing and downbar shifters. </p>



<p>The cool thing about this bike is the frame colours and design. It is interesting how they have this &#8216;snow flake&#8217; pattern on the paint work it adds a nice looking effect on it. The 27.5 version offers the same frame and fork as its 700c counterpart. It caters to the hard-core adventure rider with broad ambitions. The 27.5 features WTB Mountain Drop Bars, a riser stem, and the superior grip of WTB Nano 27.5 x 2.1&#8243; tires. The stem offers a 30 degree rise, putting you in the perfect position to ride in the drops. You get the option to get a tire clearance up to 29 x 2.0&#8243;. </p>



<p>The Masi Giramondo 27.5 is <a href="https://www.jensonusa.com/Masi-Giramondo-275-Bike-2019">available from $1,012.49</a></p>



<h3>2020 Giant Revolt 2</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1100" height="650" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bi001438-biking-red.jpg?fit=640%2C378&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-3741" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bi001438-biking-red.jpg?w=1100&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bi001438-biking-red.jpg?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bi001438-biking-red.jpg?resize=768%2C454&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bi001438-biking-red.jpg?resize=1024%2C605&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bi001438-biking-red.jpg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>This bike comes with the D-Fuse seatpost and Contact XR D-Fuse handlebar to further absorb road shocks and vibrations. The frame is integrated for disc brakes and it has clearance for larger tyres up to 45c. <a href="https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/revolt-2-2020">You can pick up the new 2020 Giant Revolt 2 gravel bike for $1,000</a>. That is great value, for the money it is a great bike that goes almost everywhere. </p>



<p>The shifting is buttery smooth, and the frame geometry gives me confidence on trails as well as steep descents. The response is great! For the price and performance it is one of the best gravel bikes you can buy! The perfect entry level gravel bike and maybe you will not even have a need to upgrade to a better one. </p>



<p>Giant is a great bike brand my first road bike was a Giant. For the money when you get a Giant your really do get your moneys worth. And it is no different with this bike. The components are great and work flawlessly. There&#8217;s even plenty of clearance for much larger tires if thats your preference. Allowing you to fit up to 45c tires. The bike features 2&#215;9 speed Shimano Sora. </p>
