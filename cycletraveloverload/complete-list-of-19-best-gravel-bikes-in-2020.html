<p>Designed with Gt&#8217;s triple triangle frame design, this bike is more then capable at grinding all types of gravel conditions. Made from a all-new grade carbon, being stiff and responsive where you need it while also soaking up impacts and vibration on those rough roads. </p>

<p>BMC have gone above and beyond with this gravel bike. Before making this bike they wanted to know that they would be at the forefront of gravel bikes. And with this URS it is safe to say they are not too far from it. Just look at this bike! </p>



<p>Super-light, race-ready frame and powerful setup combine with the famous BMC precision, state-of-the-art integration and carefully developed Gravel+ geometry. This thing is ready for what ever adventure you through its way. From <strong>$3,091</strong></p>



<h2>Cervélo Aspero 2020</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/images-1-4.jpeg?resize=532%2C305" alt="" class="wp-image-3598" width="532" height="305" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/images-1-4.jpeg?w=676&amp;ssl=1 676w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/images-1-4.jpeg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/images-1-4.jpeg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>It seems Cervélo have gone in a different direction with the Aspero. They claim the have changed the gravel design from hauling gear slowly to empowering athletes quickly. This may not sound appealing if you are looking for a gravel bike to go on epic bikepacking adventures with. </p>



<p>A lot of experience from road racing design has gone into this bike. The Áspero frame is designed with world tour stiffness for greater pedal power transfer, using less and lighter material to aid climbing and accelerating, while maximizing speeds with aerodynamic shapes critical to efficiency at speed.</p>



<p>The bike has been engineered to fit most 700&#215;42 650&#215;49 tire and wheel combinations. From <strong>$2,800</strong></p>



<h2>Giant Revolt Advanced 2020</h2>

<p>Design for gravel racing and riding this Giant is smooth, it’s efficient. This bike has landed podium finishes in big-time gravel events.

<p>The composite fork eats up bumps, and the D-Fuse seatpost and Contact XR D-Fuse handlebar absorb shocks and vibrations. The frame features integrated for disc brakes and has clearance for larger tyres up to 45c. From <strong>$3,299</strong></p>



<h2>Canyon Grail CF 2020</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Canyon_1_1-e97da42.png?resize=526%2C296" alt="" class="wp-image-3600" width="526" height="296" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Canyon_1_1-e97da42.png?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Canyon_1_1-e97da42.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Canyon_1_1-e97da42.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Canyon_1_1-e97da42.png?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>When Canyon first introduced their Grail it got the riding world buzzing, like no other gravel bike did. And they are back at it again with a epic design and those handlebars!</p>



<p>When I first noticed the handlebars from the side view I was like how are they floating like that? The Canyon Ergospeed Gel handlebars offer a dual flat bar design. The bike also comes with Shimano’s new GRX600 groupset which provides gravel-optimised shifting and braking performance. From <strong>$2,376</strong></p>



<h2>Trek Checkpoint 2020</h2>

<h2>2020 Specialized Diverge Comp</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/images-3-2.jpeg?resize=526%2C320" alt="" class="wp-image-3603" width="526" height="320" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/images-3-2.jpeg?w=709&amp;ssl=1 709w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/images-3-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/images-3-2.jpeg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>

Resulting in a bike that preforms on both dirt and road. From<strong> $2,067</strong></p>

<p>Depending on what you are looking for Norco have some great gravel bike options. The thing I like about this bike is it is tough as it is made from steel. The Search XR Steel, includes vibration-damping properties that steel provides are un-matched. When combined with thoughtful frame design, the Search XR is a pleasure to ride. Big tire clearance for 650b x 2.1” or 700c x 28c-45c tires (up to 42c with full fenders). Designed around a adventure geometry, to excel on rougher surfaces. Search XR geometry is a little slacker and longer than conventional road bikes, creating a stable ride. From <strong>$2,203.50</strong></p>
