<p>Stem Bags are an incredible bikepacking invention. They are the perfect little extra storage option for those other bits and pieces. They are great for storing things like snacks, a speaker, your phone or used food wrappers. They are quick and easy to access. Especially if you have a handlebar bag that is a little more difficult to get into while riding. </p>



<p>My motivation behind writing this article was from my own misfortune. Let me begin by stating that you get what you pay for and I spent like barley $10 for a couple stem bags from AliExpress. Yes, I know! And only just yesterday on of the stem bags was holding a nice cold bottle of Kombucha and I was riding some gnarly off-road sections. From all the stress and moving about, the attachment point to the stem on this really bad bag broke and left me dodging my bottle of Kombucha and preventing it from getting caught in the front spokes. So I have warned you! It is probably in your best interest to invest in some better quality bags then what I did.</p>



<h4>What to look for in a great stem bag or feed bag for bikepacking? </h4>



<p>Some of the better stem bags will give you more storage options then just a generic main compartment section. they also offer outside pockets and mesh designs that are very useful for storing extra stuff and keeping thing organised. </p>



<p>Also the materials of the better bags will be of higher quality. Generally something like Xpac. Yes you most likely have to pay more money for a nicer and more durable bag. But that is the thing it is going to be so much more worth it over the long run. </p>



<p>Having all that said, I went out and asked some bikepackers what stem bags they use and can recommend and this is what they approve. </p>



<ul><li>Sturdy Bag Designs Feed Bag</li><li>Revelate Mountain Feedbag</li><li>Apidura Backcountry Food Pouch Plus</li><li>The Spindle 40oz Crusher </li><li>Rockgeist Honeypot Feedbag</li><li>Randi Jo Fabrications Bartender Plus</li><li>Wizard Works &#8211; Re-Use Re-Purpose Voila! Snack Bag</li><li>Oveja Negra Chuckbucket</li></ul>



<p>Just quick, I thought it would be worth mentioning that you could also get by without even getting a stem bag. Yes, they can be sometimes expensive. You might want to look into getting a chalk bag that is used for rock climbing. As some bikepackers have claimed that they work just as well as these stem bags. </p>



<h2>Sturdy Bag Designs Feed Bag</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="594" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/feedbagnavy-1.jpg?resize=720%2C594&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4275" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/feedbagnavy-1.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/feedbagnavy-1.jpg?resize=300%2C248&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/feedbagnavy-1.jpg?resize=50%2C41&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>These Sturdy Feed bags are made from either 1000D Cordura, or Xpac outer with black ripstop liner and closure. The attachment points are to the stem, handlebar, and under fork crown making it super stable on the bike. You capacity for 32 oz or just under 1 litre for each bag. Great thing about this bag is you are able to open and close with one hand, while riding. It also includes 4 pockets on the outside of the bag for snacks/trash. Priced at <strong>$55</strong> each. </p>



<h2>Revelate Mountain Feedbag</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="495" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ae58fde2-9963-4736-9674-5c59597ae6c2-1.jpg?resize=720%2C495&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4278" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ae58fde2-9963-4736-9674-5c59597ae6c2-1.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ae58fde2-9963-4736-9674-5c59597ae6c2-1.jpg?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ae58fde2-9963-4736-9674-5c59597ae6c2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C528&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ae58fde2-9963-4736-9674-5c59597ae6c2-1.jpg?resize=50%2C34&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>This Revelate Feedbag has been redesigned so it can be used with single handed access, with a innovative drawcord system. It is safe to say that this is the original feedbag. Back 10 years ago, is when Revelate Mountain Feedbags started the entire category of stem bags. Designed to be a on-the go aid station for endurance riding. It is slightly larger than the previous version, allowing you to easily fit your beloved 1L Nalgene bottle, camera lens, and more. It even has an additional outside pocket for storing wrappers, sunscreen, granola bars and other small items.&nbsp;Priced at <strong>$49</strong></p>



<h2>Apidura Backcountry Food Pouch Plus</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1160" height="840" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Apidura-Backcountry-Food-Pouch-Plus-Pack-1.2L-On-the-handlebar.jpg?fit=640%2C464&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4279" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Apidura-Backcountry-Food-Pouch-Plus-Pack-1.2L-On-the-handlebar.jpg?w=1160&amp;ssl=1 1160w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Apidura-Backcountry-Food-Pouch-Plus-Pack-1.2L-On-the-handlebar.jpg?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Apidura-Backcountry-Food-Pouch-Plus-Pack-1.2L-On-the-handlebar.jpg?resize=768%2C556&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Apidura-Backcountry-Food-Pouch-Plus-Pack-1.2L-On-the-handlebar.jpg?resize=1024%2C742&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Apidura-Backcountry-Food-Pouch-Plus-Pack-1.2L-On-the-handlebar.jpg?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Apidure Backcountry Food Pouch Plus is like the original but it has a few upgrades. Again like most stem bags this bag attaches to the bike with a three point secured system. The exterior mesh pockets are useful for catching empty wrappers, while a mesh drainage hole helps to keep the interior dry. Also featuring a one handed opening and closing system. The bag is made from tough body fabric and a padded interior make sure that valuables stay protected. The material that makes up this bag is waterproof but due to the design the bag is not waterproof. Which is not really necessary for a stem bag. Available in a large 1.2 L capacity option. Priced at <strong>£35.00</strong></p>



<h2>The Spindle 40oz Crusher </h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="513" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC_4464.jpg?resize=720%2C513&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4280" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC_4464.jpg?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC_4464.jpg?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC_4464.jpg?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Recommend by a couple bikepackers not the biggest bikepacking bike bag brand out there but their stuff is not bad. Named the 40 oz as it it capable in housing 1.18L water bottles. While including a elastic mesh pocket which gives you secure and additional space for your belongings. priced at <strong>$70</strong></p>



<h2>Rockgeist Honeypot Feedbag</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC08706.jpg?fit=640%2C532&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4281" width="454" height="377" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC08706.jpg?w=2578&amp;ssl=1 2578w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC08706.jpg?resize=300%2C249&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC08706.jpg?resize=768%2C638&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC08706.jpg?resize=1024%2C851&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC08706.jpg?resize=50%2C42&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC08706.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC08706.jpg?w=2160 2160w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></figure></div>



<p>I didn&#8217;t know this being an Australian but it seems the Nalgene® bottles are super popular and like many stem bags they are designed around fitting these bottles. Also this Rockgeist Honeypot feedbag also works well with Hydroflasks, bike bottles, or other large circular items. Well designed with a Dyneema® reinforced drawcord channel, an X-Pac™ collar, and closed cell foam in the body panel. So you can have confidence that this product is going to last. At lot longer then my super cheap stem bag. A well thought out design with a full circumference daisy chain to get the best fit to your specific cockpit. Starting from <strong>$49.95 </strong>each</p>



<h2>Randi Jo Fabrications Bartender Plus</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1250" height="1250" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC00321-2_2000x.jpg?fit=640%2C640&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4282" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC00321-2_2000x.jpg?w=1250&amp;ssl=1 1250w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC00321-2_2000x.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC00321-2_2000x.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC00321-2_2000x.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC00321-2_2000x.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DSC00321-2_2000x.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>

<p>I love the direct Wizard Works have gone with these bags. And well i love the idea of re-using and creating something that is going to get some great use out of something that was going to be throw away! They take the&nbsp;iconic Thomson® bags that their&nbsp;precious&nbsp;components come in, and re-purposes&nbsp;them as new bags. Plus 1 for the planet and well they also look really cool. They also make some in a Maxxis design to. Which is probably my favourite only because well I grew up as a kid and Maxxis tires is what I remember the most about all my bikes. Priced at <strong>£59.99</strong>&nbsp;and you save the environment to, it&#8217;s a win, win!!</p>

<p>Trust me these stem bags not only made it in this blog post only because of their name! They are backed by many of the bikepackers that I asked for this article. Enabling fast access to goods while you&#8217;re in the saddle. Purpose built around a 1L Nalgene and 40 oz. Klean Kanteen. The ChuckBucket has more then enough storage for all that you need to store in this cool stem bag, like, plenty of volume to handle snacks and water bottles. Again another on of these stem bags that feature a one handed opening and closing lets you stay in control of your bike. Priced at <strong>$55</strong></p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t have a stem bag then you might want to consider one if you are not think about getting one. They are the best extra storage solutions for bikepacking. Allowing you to easily access food on the go when you need it. At least you can count on these bags to be able to stand up to the tough use of bikepacking. And completely prevent a bottle of Kombucha from messing you up on a gnarly down hill trail. </p>
