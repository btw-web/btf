<p>Are you looking for a gravel wheel set for your next bikepacking adventures? I am! Over some time I have been building out my Surly Long Haul Trucker building it into a custom bikepacking bike. I love the steel frames and all ready have this bike so I made it a project over time to upgrade all the parts to make it my dream bikepacking rig. </p>



<p>At this time of writing this article I am looking for a gravel wheelset that is best for adventure cycling and that off-road bikepacking style of riding. As I am researching the internet and asking a large group of off-road bikepacking riders what gravel wheels they use and can recommend. I have come up with a detail list of some of the best gravel wheelsets you can look at if you are planning to get some new wheels for your rig. </p>



<h3>Type of Riding</h3>



<p>The type of riding will effect the type of wheelset you get. Gravel is such a broad area, it essentially includes, gravel racing, off-road bikepacking adventures, and even cyclocross potentially. Some wheels are better suited for gravel racing and not designed to cater for the added weight that can be expected for bikepacking adventures. So a bikepacking specific gravel wheelset is best for that and is often mentioned in the wheelset description on the sales page. </p>



<h3>Wheelset Material</h3>



<p>Material is something to consider when looking for a wheelset for bikepacking adventure in particular. If you are looking at carrying some gear on your bike a carbon wheelset may not be the best option as you will experience some wheel flex. Some have said they get quite a bit of lateral flex when climbing steep hills. Also Carbon is lighter this is proven to result in some faster riding speeds and better overall efficiency. Overall weight differences does not effect me that much personally and I don&#8217;t mind running Alloy for that little extra strength when the bike is loaded. </p>



<h3>Configure Your Own Wheels </h3>



<p>You could build your own wheels if you wanted. Get your local builder lace them, if you have no idea about getting the spokes on. In this article I have included some rim option to use as a base to build up. There is so many differ hubs and spokes that you can build from and those details will not be covered in this post, just want to make it only about wheelsets as much as possible for now. </p>



<p>The point of building your own wheelset is that you get to chose instead of going with pre packaged. The hubs are usually pretty generic on stock wheelsets when you buy them complete. But they may be decent. There is no limitations on hub rim combos but more they will generally be more expensive. It also just makes it more personal, you have a sense of pride knowing that your bike as a unique wheelset. And lets be real building stuff is fun! For example you could get some <strong>WTB KOM Tough i25 TCS Rims</strong> and build them with some <strong>DT Swiss 350s</strong> <strong>Hubs</strong> for a nice wheelset combination.</p>



<p>Triple butted spokes such as the sapim force and DT alipne 3 offer the best durability. 36 spoke rear with 32 front for carrying cargo, or just a heavy rider. 32 rear with 28 front for a lighter, and cheaper wheel build that&#8217;s still quite strong. Combine this with a good set of hubs and rims, and don&#8217;t forget that the skill of the builder is paramount. But if you are looking for just a wheelset like me then I have you covered. </p>

<p>These wheels are best for gravel and off road riding that require wider tires for exploring off the beaten path. </p>

<p>Hunt make some great all round bikepakcing wheelsets. But more specifically there Superdura Dynamo Wheelset is great value for the money. Originally designed for  Ultra Distance Cycling, they also offer convenience when commuting, training and road/off-road bike-packing. As you get a Dynamo hub all ready with these wheels it seems like a no brainer to really consider these wheels. Perfect for bikepacking when you need to charge lights and other devices while out on the road. </p>

<p>The Superdura Dynamo Wheelset comes with wide tubeless asymmetric SuperDura rims, extra sealed and shielded 4 Season Disc rear hub, and a seriously durable high 28-spoke build (of Pillar&#8217;s light and extremely strong triple-butted PSR spokes). Even with the extra 240g of the dynamo hub, this wheelset (at 1821g) is still lighter than many disc-brake wheels fitted to bikes as original equipment. The Wheelset pair only come sin at <strong>$689 USD</strong></p>



<p>The people I have talked to who have Hunt Wheels even people who have more then one set of wheels from Hunt. Say &#8220;they are in my opinion the best value in wheels right now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Also the <strong>MASON X HUNT 650B ADVENTURE SPORT DISC WHEELSET</strong> is another popular gravel option some have states that they are quiet loud though. And also the <strong>MASON X HUNT 4 SEASON DISC WHEELSET</strong> is great value. </p>
