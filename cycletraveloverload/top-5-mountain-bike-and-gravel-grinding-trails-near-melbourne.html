<p>For this article in my ‘best mountain biking trails in Australia’ series I’m coming home to Melbourne. For those of you who don’t know, it’s the state capital of Victoria and we sit in the most southern tip of Australia before you get over to Tassie. </p>



<p>I love living in Melbourne, it’s full of life and getting out into the wild is so easy. If our borders stay closed I know I would be happy for a while exploring the national parks around me and I would recommend anyone thinking about staycation-ing to visit Melbourne and the parks that surround it.</p>



<p>I’m not here to tell you which street art tour you should go on, or which beach to visit or what coffee shop is the best. </p>



<p>I’m here to tell you my favourite mountain bike trails around my home city. I‘ve ridden most of these in part but I’ve included a couple I haven’t yet got round too because I hadn’t really researched locally before. </p>



<p>How weird is that? I spend so much of my time looking at bikepacking routes and adventures around the globe that you never really think to look on your doorstep do you! I’ve left my favourite until last, ‘plenty’ of fun to be had here.</p>

<p>This park became more famous after the Melbourne Commonwealth Games as it was host to the MTB events. This leaves the trails well groomed and good fun. </p>



<p>There’s nothing too technical here so it’s a great place for intermediate and beginners and people looking for some good flows. I’ve ridden here a few times and enjoy the flows around the lake after work. </p>



<p>It is a popular spot for people walking and the kangaroos don’t really pay attention to the trail signage so be ready on your brakes! </p>



<p>If you’ve got kids or going out with mates for the day it’s a pretty good spot, it’s got lots of facilities, a cafe and a bike shop which a lot of parks don’t have.</p>

<p>Sitting over on Mornington Peninsula this is one for a day out or weekend away. I’ve been here a couple of times and had a great time (and come off a few times!). </p>



<p>It’s got some more advanced trails with some white knuckle rocky drops and everything is signposted too. They’ve got a skills park, enduro loops, large boulders, fast corners, downhills and techy uphills. </p>



<p>This is a great place for anyone from beginner to more expert. Some of the routes are one way and some have people going in both directions so keep and eye out for which is which. </p>

<p>Venturing about 100km away from the CBD is the beautiful forest setting of Buxton MTB Park. I came here with some mates not that long ago and we were all mixed ability and it was so much fun. Even the guys who hadn’t done much mountain biking before loved it. </p>



<p>There’s over 20km of trails here winding through the forest. There’s some sneaky off camber corners to be tackled here but mostly long blue flowy loops with a few jumps through gorgeous, raw, nature. </p>



<p>Watch out for the cathedral climb, that’s a tough one! This is definitely worth travelling out of the city for. Bring your supplies with you because there is only a drop toilet here </p>

<p>So I have to admit, I knew about this place but I’ve never got around to going. I’ve heard good things about it and that the skills park is good fun. I haven’t really got an excuse as it’s so central. </p>



<p>It’s only 10mins from the CBD and right near Footscray station. It’s got great views of the city over the river. It&#8217;s a purpose built park that was built by the council on a disused Quarry and landfill site. </p>



<p>It has beginner, intermediate and expert level tracks that seem pretty well thought out. The reviews give it over 4.5/10 so I think I’ll go and check it out soon. Probably one to go and try for a few hours rather than a full day out.</p>

<p>This is my ultimate favourite place to go MTB riding in Melbourne. It really is a ‘plentiful’ gorge. It&#8217;s got well over 100 trails covering all abilities. There’s so many gnarly and fun expert level trails here going over rock gardens and big obstacles. Bring lots of water with you because it can be a sweaty time. Some of the trails aren’t signposted so make sure you print out a trail map before you begin, or just get lost in the awesomeness!</p>



<p>So there we have it, I’ve whittled down my favourite rides near the city into a list of 5 for you. I’m actually going to do and try the Quarry Park this afternoon now I’ve had a look into it!</p>



<p>I hope you guys love my suggestions when you come and visit too. If you want to head out of the city then <a href="https://www.visitotways.com/ride-forrest/trails/yaugher-trails-network-the-northern-loop/">Forrest Yaugher</a> and <a href="https://www.trailforks.com/region/big-hill-mountain-bike-park/?activitytype=1&amp;z=13.2&amp;lat=-36.74291&amp;lon=147.18396">Big Hill MTB Park</a> are a bit further out but definitely worth the 4hour drive. Big Hill has got absolutely everything you could want from a MTB park and is one of the most iconic places to ride in Victoria, well probably in Australia.&nbsp;</p>
