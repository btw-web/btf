<p>Is this the ultimate full suspension trail mountain bike for bikepacking? If you plan to ride some of the roughest and rugged routes, as FS MTB is ideal. And with the variety of <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-full-suspension-frame-bags/">full suspension frame bags</a> there is so much potential to make a bikepacking adventure on such terrain possible. </p>

<p>Essentially the Ripley is a &#8220;snappy, flickable, playful, fast, lightweight, and versatile 29” trail bike.&#8221; The bikes comes with a rear travel of 120 mm and a front of 130mm. Rolling on some 29&#8243; tires with the option to fit up to 2.6. It features the DW Link suspension platform. A unpar­al­leled com­bi­na­tion of climb­ing effi­cien­cy and down­hill per­for­mance. You get rather long dropper posts on this bike, with the ultra low stan­dovers and clear­ance for long drop­pers, you get the abil­i­ty to size based on&nbsp;reach. The reach is increased an average of 45mm across all frame sizes. </p>



<p>No matter is you get their high level XTR to the NX you still get the same frame which is built from the high­est grade mate­ri­als and opti­mised for the best strength, weight, stiff­ness, and ride per­for­mance. The bike also features a downtube frame protector, which is a remov­able poly­car­bon­ate skid plate that pro­tects your down­tube from sharp pointy things.</p>

<p>To compare the previous Ripley and&nbsp;find major similarities between it and the new Ripley V4, is a tough challenge! They both have carbon frames and 29” wheels, but that is basically where the similarities end. Instead the V4 has taken on a redesign from the ground up and now showcases a silhouette very similar to its big brother, the Ibis Ripmo. </p>



<h3>What Has Changed On The New Ibis Ripley?</h3>



<p>The front fork is a custom collaboration with Fox. The Fox Float 34 Performance Series 130mm, 29”, 15QR fork. Ibis did notice that some people are running 120mm and 140 mm forks, which is something they support. </p>



<p>With this 130mm fork which used to be 120mm means that you get a bottom bracket with is half a cm higher off the ground. As some people were pedal striking under the previous metrics. You also get a shorter fork offset, instead of the typical 51mm off­set, the new Rip­ley uses a&nbsp;44mm off­set.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Exploring the High Desert aboard the Ibis Ripley" width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BqOnVX8Orgo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>They have also steepened the seat tube angle and that comes in at 76 degrees. And the head tube angle is at 66.5 degrees. This all results in a nice balance of quick snappy steering, along with a confidence locked in feel. Plus a overall comfortable and fun to pedal bike. </p>



<p>Also same with the Ripmo they have pulled the reach out making it 475 mm for large and medium is 450mm the previous Ripley Medium size was 411mm. </p>



<p>The chainstay on this new Ripley has also been tucked in a bit more then the previous Ripley. It is over 1 cm! All these changes overall make this bike so much more capable. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LM-IBIS-Ripley-4057-1800px.jpg?resize=720%2C480&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4952" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LM-IBIS-Ripley-4057-1800px.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LM-IBIS-Ripley-4057-1800px.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LM-IBIS-Ripley-4057-1800px.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LM-IBIS-Ripley-4057-1800px.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LM-IBIS-Ripley-4057-1800px.jpg?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LM-IBIS-Ripley-4057-1800px.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Most of these changes equate to a all around lighter bike. 0.65 pounds lighter than the previous Ripley V3 or 295 grams. If you are really counting the grams for bikepacking then this is quiet a difference. </p>



<p>The have upgraded the internal cable tunnels making internal routing easier than ever before.</p>



<h3>Different Models Of The Ibis Ripley</h3>



<p>There are a few different models available for the Ibis Ripley, in this article we are going to cover the 3 most commonly found options that you can purchase online over at Jenson USA. </p>



<h4>IBIS RIPLEY 4 NX EAGLE BIKE 2020</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="427" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001353-braaap-black.jpg?resize=720%2C427&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4947" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001353-braaap-black.jpg?w=843&amp;ssl=1 843w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001353-braaap-black.jpg?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001353-braaap-black.jpg?resize=768%2C456&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001353-braaap-black.jpg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Ripley NX model is the cheapest option out of the Ripley V4 lineup at <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FIbis-Ripley-4-NX-Eagle-Bike-2020">$4,199</a>. So we are going to try our best compare all these three bikes and make sense of the price differences. But first we must preface by stating what is standard on all the options. The frame is all the same with the Carbon Fiber Monocoque and Fox Float 34 Performance Series 130mm, 29”, 15QR front fork. Rims are all the same with Ibis S35 Aluminum / 29&#8243; / Ibis Hubs and different disk rotors for each bike that we will get into later. All bikes have the WTB Silverado Pro 142mm width saddle, Cane Creek 40 ZS44/ZS56 headset, 73mm English threaded bottom bracket, and Fox Float Performance DPS with EVOL, 190&#215;45 rear shock. Further more they all feature 1&#215;12 drivetrains but varying component levels. </p>



<p>So with the NX you get the high-end SRAM NX Eagle groupset, with SRAM NX Eagle, DUB spindle, 32t Steel Ring (170mm for S/M, 175mm for L/XL) Crank. SRAM PG 1230 11-50T cassette and SRAM Level T brakes. The handlebars are the Ibis 780mm Alloy, KS Rage-i Dropper post (125 or 150mm), and SRAM Centerline 180 disk rotors. </p>



<h4>IBIS RIPLEY 4 GX EAGLE BIKE 2020</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="428" src="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001349-blue-steel.jpg?resize=720%2C428&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4948" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001349-blue-steel.jpg?w=843&amp;ssl=1 843w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001349-blue-steel.jpg?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001349-blue-steel.jpg?resize=768%2C456&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001349-blue-steel.jpg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Next is the GX which has all the same stuff as previously mentioned first with the NX model in the first paragraph. But what are the major differences in this bike? </p>



<p>This bike features the high-end SRAM GX Eagle groupset, with a SRAM Descendant Alloy 175, DUB spindle, 32t Alloy Ring (170mm for S/M, 175mm for L/XL) crank. Along with a SRAM XG 1275 10-50 12 speed. This means one less tooth on the low one compared to the NX model. The brakes are Shimano Deore 2 Piston, Ibis 800mm Carbon (30mm rise) handlebars and a Bike Yoke Revive Dropper post (125, 160 or 185mm). Please note there is a 250lb rider weight limit on this post. And the disk rotors are the Shimano SM-RT66 180 (not to be mistaken with the XT models &#8220;SM-RT86&#8221;). The price for the Ibis Ripley GX Eagle comes in at <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FIbis-Ripley-4-GX-Eagle-Bike-2020">$5,399.00 at Jenson USA</a>. </p>



<h4>IBIS RIPLEY 4 XT M8100 BIKE 2020</h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="422" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001365-braaap-black.jpg?resize=720%2C422&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4949" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001365-braaap-black.jpg?w=843&amp;ssl=1 843w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001365-braaap-black.jpg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001365-braaap-black.jpg?resize=768%2C450&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bi001365-braaap-black.jpg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Again the top of the range XT Ripley includes all the same kit as mentioned but a few more upgraded parts! First price it is $400 more expensive then the previous GX at <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=5ba16a4e-c704-4699-ad75-0978eed92f06&amp;website_id=ef3d6e1a-bfea-4148-bd08-ee4789fed381&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FIbis-Ripley-4-XT-M8100-Bike-2020">$5,799</a>! But it does come with a high-end Shimano XT M8100 Shadow Plus 12 speed groupset. Shimano XT M8100, 24mm spindle, 32t Alloy Ring (170mm for S/M, 175mm for L/XL) crank. All three bikes have 32 tooth cranksets. The XT features a Shimano XT 10-51t 12 speed cassette. The same 10 tooth for the small ring and and extra 1 tooth to make it 51 on the large ring. The brakes are a Shimano XT M8100 2 Piston. The stem on this bike is different then the previous two with the Thomson Elite X4 Stem (40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110). Handlebars are Ibis 800mm Carbon (30mm rise). And the same Bike Yoke Revive Dropper post (125, 160 or 185mm) as the GX. And finally you have those Shimano SM-RT86 180 disk rotors. </p>



<p>Also the tires for all the bikes are Schwalbe Hans Dampf (front) Nobby Nic (rear) 29&#8243; x 2.35&#8243;. It may depend on where you buy this bike from but at Jenson USA this is what you can expect.</p>



<h3>Ibis Ripley vs Ripmo</h3>
