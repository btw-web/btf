<p>The short answer is almost! While they are not as fast as most road bikes are on road and struggle to keep up with mountain bikes on the trails. They are the type of bike which finds a nice middle ground. Allowing you to taste  both worlds with just the one bike. </p>



<p>Plus if you really know what your looking at you can get a gravel bike that can do it all for your personal riding needs. Also what does &#8220;do it all&#8221; mean? I think of all types of riding. And yes they can shred trails, ride on roads, go on epic cross-country adventures and even go places ideal for fat bikes. They can be the ultimate do it all bike! </p>



<p>By nature this means you are limited on how extreme you can take it on both ends of the spectrum. While there is a huge range of gravels bikes that are faster and more suited for riding fast on road. There are also some dedicated to off-road adventures which also make them great for shredding the local mountain bike trails. </p>



<p>This is why it&#8217;s important to do your research before you jump right in and purchase your first gravel bike. You may need to also consider what type of riding you specifically have in mind. Because you don&#8217;t want to buy a basic gravel bike with average tire clearance and unsuitable geometry if you plan to use it as an off-road touring machine. </p>



<h3>Advantages Of Gravel Bikes</h3>



<p>There are many advantages to owning a gravel bike. And many of them tie into the purpose of a bike that pretty much can do it all. </p>



<h4>Two Bikes in One</h4>



<p>You can get two different sets of wheels and tires for your gravel bike. If you are smart and opt for a bike with larger tire clearance. You can run a skinny road tire for those morning group rides and switch over to 29er mountain bike tires when it comes time to shredding the local trails. Saving you money by only owning one bike and giving you more room in the garage. </p>



<h4>Go Anywhere</h4>



<p>You can can just about anywhere on the right gravel bike. Especially if you look at getting a off-road adventure gravel bike! These bikes have large tire clearances, comfortable and upright riding geometry, and all the accessory and mounts for all your camping gear to go anywhere! </p>



<h4>Simple</h4>



<p>Gravel bikes are based on simplistic yet reliable design, meaning they have fewer components and parts that can break and things to go wrong. Which is perfect if you are looking to use a gravel bike for epic remote adventures where getting spare parts is not an option. My personal favourite type of bike are steel gravel bikes. This material is perfect for someone looking for a bike that is strong and reliable. </p>



<h4>Slowing down and enjoy the ride</h4>



<p>Like a touring bike. Gravel bikes are generally heavier than most road bikes (but not always). And if you plan to ride with gear this means you wont be taking many KOMS. Which is why they are a great way to focus more on the moment rather than how fast your travelling. </p>



<h4>They are fun</h4>



<p>Allowing you to explore the roads less travelled and go further than what you could on a road bike. If your a roadie looking to explore those un-explored gravel roads or a mountain biker looking to get into all-road riding. A gravel bike is your best bet. And because you can go places a bike might not have been able to take you before its so much more fun! </p>



<h4>Versatile </h4>



<p>Whether it&#8217;s touring, mountain biking, cyclocross, road riding they are a great choice for us normal people who are looking to enjoy all types of riding. If you plan to win races and take KOMS a gravel bike might hold you back. </p>



<h3><strong>Can gravel bikes be used as a mountain bike?</strong></h3>



<p>Some gravel bikes are actually decent enough to use as mountain bikes. But it is important to remember that not all gravel bikes are able. The majority of gravel bikes available on the market come with 45 to 50c tires and are not entirely capable enough for shredding your local mountain bike trails. Along with a lack of suppleness provided from larger volume tires. Also some gravel bikes are just right when it comes to geometry. As some try to immulate a slightly more versatile road bike. </p>



<p>But if you find the most ideal gravel bike, you can use them as a mountain bike. There are even some bikes labelled <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/top-8-drop-bar-mountain-bikes/">drop bar mountain bikes</a> which are essentially gravel bikes with larger tire clearance and mountain bike geometry with just drop bars instead of flats. </p>



<p>Even in todays day some gravel bikes even offer other mountain bike accessories like dropper posts, wider gear ranges, mountain bike tires from stock. and other mountain bike features. </p>



<h3><strong>Can gravel bikes go on trails</strong>? </h3>



<p>Again if you get the right gravel bike you can ride trails and use them as a mountain bike. I know from personal experience. As I own a Kona Sutra LTD and have upgraded it with 2.3&#8243;x 29er MTB tires and smaller front chainring to allow for a better climbing gear, which gives 18 gear inches. Which is up there with most mountain bikes. Allowing you to ride right up the hills like a MTB does. </p>



<p>However it is worth noting that not all gravel bikes come with all these features to make them truely versatile mountain bike machines. But if you do your research before buying you can find some bikes that essentially make perfect all-rounders. </p>



<h3><strong>Is a gravel bike the only bike you need?</strong></h3>



<p>Is it safe to say then that the gravel bike is the only bike you need? Put simply it really does depend on what you need the bike for specifically. If you are looking to be the best and compete in specific bike disciplines than a more specific bike for say cyclocross is ideal. </p>



<p>If you are like the rest of us and are just out here to enjoy bike riding and explore new places. The humble gravel bike could offer that type of the one bike to do it all!</p>



<p>In my experience for example, the only bike I have is a gravel bike. But as I begin to get more and more into mountain biking I am starting to realise that I might actually need a hardtail. Some of the trails are quite challenging on a gravel bike and after some time I think I would appreciate the extra comfort from front suspension. </p>



<p>But if you are just getting into bike riding in general the gravel bike makes a  perfect entry level into many types of riding. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-value-gravel-bikes/">This</a> is a good place to start if you are looking for the perfect bike for the best value. </p>



<h3><strong>Are gravel bikes any good on the road?</strong></h3>



<p>Again gravel bikes come in many different shapes and sizes. Meaning there are bikes more suited to road riding and very light gravel, to full off-road adventure gravel bikes. You can definitely use a gravel bike as your road bike and change out wheels and tires for when you want to explore those lesser travelled gravel roads. You shouldn&#8217;t have any problems keeping up with your roadie mates, but don&#8217;t expect to win races. <a href="https://cycletraveloverload.com/best-road-gravel-bikes-adventure-road-bikes-the-ultimate-list/">Here</a> are some bikes worth checking out. </p>



<h3><strong>Is a gravel bike good for long rides?</strong></h3>



<p>Most gravel bikes are made with adventure in mind. And this often means long rides and days in the saddle. For this reason most gravel bikes are designed with a more upright geometry. Generally the stack/reach ratio is a little more relaxed in comparison to a road bike. </p>



<p>Gravel bikes also offer accessory mounts for all your camping gear, giving you the option to attach bags to hold more food the fuel you on your longer rides. But also allowing you to go on multi-day bikepacking adventures.</p>
