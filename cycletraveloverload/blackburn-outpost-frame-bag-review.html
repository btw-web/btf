<p>About 3 months ago I was looking for a budget friendly bikepacking frame bag that I could use for my Surly Long Haul Trucker. Before getting this frame bag. I have never used a frame bag, but have always wanted to get one and make the most of the benefits a frame bag offers in completing a bikepacking setup. </p>

<p>It attaches to the inner frame of your bike with a series of velcro straps, that are able to move around to suit your bike frame geometry. Around the top tube, down tube and seat tube. Available in to color options, the black or camo. This Blackburn frame bag comes in three different sizes (small, medium and large). </p>



<p>It is a expandable frame bag, allowing for the possibility to run a half sized frame bag or un-zipping the zipper to turn it into a full frame bag. </p>

<p>On the left side you have a full rang zip that is handy for storing spare tools, phone and other things like snacks. Then on the right side of the frame is the large compartment. On the outside you get to mesh pockets. on the inside it has a cool looking topographic map style pattern, that works well. </p>



<p>It also has a port to connect a hydration tube, making it great to pack a hydration bladder for extra water storage is needed. </p>

<h2>Great Things About The Blackburn Outpost Frame Bag</h2>



<ul><li>I really like the aesthetics of this frame bag, it looks nice. I got the black frame bag option, but the camo looks cool. </li><li>Good volume for the type of bag. The space inside the bag provides more then enough space. However not as efficient as a custom build frame bag. But considering this is a cheap bikepacking bag it ticks the boxes.</li><li>The organisation of the bag. Offers many storage compartments like the mesh on the side, a seperate zip compartment on the left and the large compartment also allows for you to seperate into two spaces with a removable velcro wall.  </li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1688" height="950" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3767.jpg?fit=720%2C405" alt="" class="wp-image-2295" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3767.jpg?w=1688&amp;ssl=1 1688w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3767.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3767.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3767.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3767.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3767.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>The price is the most liked thing about this bag, it is perfect if you are just getting into bikepacking and just want to test the waters without spending a fortune on bikepacking bags. Only coming in at around $65, it is nice and cheap.

<h2>Not So Great Things About The Blackburn Outpost Frame Bag</h2>



<ul><li>The straps on this frame bag are just velcro straps. Not providing any frame protection and are abrasive to the frame. The Blackburn toptube bag offers a material on the straps that protect the frame, however this bag does not. </li><li>Also on the straps. The two that attach to the front and back of the frame are way too long. And will need to be cut and using a lighter to burn the material to prevent fraying. It would be better if it came stock with shorter straps there. </li></ul>

<ul><li>The lower half of the bag is thinner fabric, when the bag is fully loaded it may rub on your legs when pedalling. However I had no problems with this, just worth mentioning. </li></ul>



<h2>Keep These Things In Mind&nbsp;</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1688" height="950" src="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3761.jpg?fit=720%2C405" alt="" class="wp-image-2297" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3761.jpg?w=1688&amp;ssl=1 1688w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3761.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3761.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3761.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3761.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3761.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li> The bag is not 100$ waterproof. However it did a okay job with keeping my gear semi dry. I tried to make sure not to store anything that I din&#8217;t want getting wet in it. Things like paper and that would get very damp. </li><li>It is not a custom made bag so don&#8217;t expect it to fit to your frame exactly. However for a off the shelf bag it does a good job to be able to provide for most frame sizes and shapes. </li></ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Overall it is a good bag for the price, offering some great features, like the hole for a hydration tube. You get some organisation and it looks nice. Is it going to stand up to the use of a bike tour? In my opinion and from my experience yes it does the job very well. I have ridden with it for a few thousand km and it has no signs of wearing down and being faulty. </p>



<p>This bag totally makes sense if you want a budget bikepacking frame bag option, preventing you from making a huge financial investment if you are just getting started in this world of bikepacking. On the plus side it aloows for you to have more money to spend elsewhere like for the daily expenses on a epic trip. </p>
