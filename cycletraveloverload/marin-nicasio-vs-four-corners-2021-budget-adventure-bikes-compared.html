<p>The Marin budget adventure bike battle! Well which bike is best? We are going to compare one of Marins steel gravel bike options with their touring bike, side by side and see what the difference is between each. When it comes to price the Marin Nicasio + (the Nicasio model I recommend most) is $150 cheaper at only $899 when the Four Corners is $1,049. But what really is the difference and which one is best for you and your riding goals?</p>



<p>These bikes are great starting points if you are looking to get started bikepacking or touring! At that $1,000 mark you get decent quality with a well designed bike. I actually just purchased the Nicasio + for my dad to get started bikepacking with! </p>



<p>The Marin Nicasio is essentially a gravel bike best at home for adventures that take you adventure road and off-road riding, long distance commuting, and endurance and all-weather pavement. While the Four Corners is at home, touring, bikepacking and dedicated commuting. Both bikes are just as capable at tackling similar terrains and adventures, in my own opinion.</p>

<p>Both bikes come in a few different options, the purpose of this article is to stack each bike side by side so you can asses the data and make a more informed decision. But first let&#8217;s take a look at all the options available. </p>



<h2>2021 Marin Nicasio</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="439" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NICASIO-BLK-R-1.jpg?resize=720%2C439&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6714" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NICASIO-BLK-R-1.jpg?w=1919&amp;ssl=1 1919w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NICASIO-BLK-R-1.jpg?resize=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NICASIO-BLK-R-1.jpg?resize=768%2C468&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NICASIO-BLK-R-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C624&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NICASIO-BLK-R-1.jpg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NICASIO-BLK-R-1.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The entry level Nicasio, I personally wouldn&#8217;t recommend this one if you are looking to tackle some rad adventures, as this option is limited with its components. And the other Nicasio bikes are much more capable for a few hundred dollars extra. So this bike comes in at $759.00</p>



<p>It is a full steel gravel bike with a 2 x 8 Claris groupset and mechanical disc brakes. With skinny Vee Tire, Apache Chief, 700Cx30 tires. Featuring the same Series 1 Steel that the Nicasio Plus has. It has the FSA Tempo Compact, 50/34T and SunRace 8-Speed, 11-32T cassette. Giving the bike a 28.46&#8243; granny gear and 122.17&#8243; highest gear. With a 1.06 : 4.55 gear ratio.</p>



<h2>2021 Marin Nicasio+</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="420" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED.jpg?resize=720%2C420&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6715" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED.jpg?w=1776&amp;ssl=1 1776w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED.jpg?resize=300%2C175&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED.jpg?resize=768%2C448&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED.jpg?resize=1024%2C598&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED.jpg?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY20-Nicasio-P-Final-PATHLESSPEDALED.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>The Marin Nicasio Plus comes with 650b wheels and 47c tires. With a tire clearance for <strong>up to 700C x 35mm or 650B x 47mm&nbsp;tires.</strong> Powered by a 1 x 9 MicroSHIFT Advent groupset, which includes a FSA Tempo Compact, Narrow Wide, 42T crank and SunRace 9-Speed, 11-46T cassette. </p>



<p>Which gives the bike a decent 24.15&#8243; granny gear (which is good enough if you plan to ride with under 10kg of gear, so bikepacking setups). And a highest gear of 101.37&#8243; which is a gear ratio of 0.91 : 3.82!</p>



<p>There are a few differences between this bike and the first Nicasio, in mechanical disc brakes and other parts. I am including a detailed side by side comparison of all specs below bike introductions for an easier to read look. However the Nicasio Plus comes in at $899 and has some great adventure riding potential for such a great price! </p>



<h2>2021 Marin Nicasio 2</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="441" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Nicasio-2-Blue-P-Final-1000x540.jpg?resize=720%2C441&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6716" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Nicasio-2-Blue-P-Final-1000x540.jpg?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Nicasio-2-Blue-P-Final-1000x540.jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Nicasio-2-Blue-P-Final-1000x540.jpg?resize=768%2C470&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Nicasio-2-Blue-P-Final-1000x540.jpg?resize=1024%2C627&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Nicasio-2-Blue-P-Final-1000x540.jpg?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Nicasio-2-Blue-P-Final-1000x540.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Then you have the Nicasio 2 which is a bit more advanced and more pricy option. But you get some upgrades. The Series 2 CrMo frame with Beyond Road Geometry, along with a Marin Full Carbon&nbsp;fork, for that extra suppleness when adventuring off-road. </p>



<p>It has a tire clearance for up to <strong>700 x 40mm or 650b x 47mm&nbsp;tires</strong>. So you can swap over those WTB, Riddler Comp, 700Cx37 tires and wheels for something a bit wider. </p>



<p>The main difference with this bike is the upgrade to mid-range components with the 2 x 10 Tiagra groupset and hydraulic disc brakes for $1,499.00</p>



<p>Coming with a FSA Omega MegaExo, 50/34T crank and Shimano 10-Speed, 11-34T cassette. Which means a 27.40&#8243; granny gear and 124.68&#8243; highest gear. And a 1 : 4.55 gear ratio. </p>



<p>Honestly I would have like to see Marin make a Nicasio with a carbon fork that has a 1x drivetrain. But they have other more advanced carbon gravel bike options if you want to spend more. </p>



<h2>2021 Marin Four Corners</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="431" src="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Four-Corner-Green-P-Final.jpg?resize=720%2C431&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6717" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Four-Corner-Green-P-Final.jpg?w=1695&amp;ssl=1 1695w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Four-Corner-Green-P-Final.jpg?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Four-Corner-Green-P-Final.jpg?resize=768%2C460&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Four-Corner-Green-P-Final.jpg?resize=1024%2C613&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Four-Corner-Green-P-Final.jpg?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/cycletraveloverload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MY21-Marin-Four-Corner-Green-P-Final.jpg?w=1440 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>



<p>Now the Four Corners! A bike that is designed to handle full loaded touring! If this is what you see your future to involve then this is the better choice than the Nicasio. There is only one 2021 model from what I can see Marin have released. They also have their Marin Four Corners Elite for almost $1000 more! </p>



<p>This 2021 build features Marin&#8217;s Utilitour Double Butted CrMo frame, with Size-Specific Wheels (XS, S = 650B, M, L, XL = 700C) and the Biometric Geometry design makes for more upright and comfortable riding position for those multi day, week, or month long tours. </p>



<p>The bike comes with a 3 x 9 Sora and mechanical disc brakes. A Shimano Sora Hollowtech II, 50/39/30T crank and Shimano HG300 9-Speed, 11-34T cassette. Giving you a decent range, ideally would expect better for a touring bike. but it manages a 24.46&#8243; granny gear and 126.47&#8243; highest gear. That is a 0.88 : 4.55 gear ratio. </p>



<p>From what I hear the max tire clearance for the Four Corners is 29 x 2&#8243; This bike comes in at $1,049, you do get a few extra mounting options on this bike compared to the Nicasio. </p>

<h2>Geometry – Nicasio Vs Four Corners</h2>



<p>Geometry can play a big part in the difference of how I bike rides and feels. It is definitely something to consider when buying a bike. Overall the Four Corners has a slightly more upright riding position, but the Nicasio 2 matches it. Longer chainstay and wheelbase with shorter trail on the Four Corners make for a more stable bike in the rear and predictable in the front. All the measurements below are in mm and are for both 54 cm or medium sized bikes.</p>

<p>Overall these bikes have a similar geometry when compared to some other gravel and touring bikes out there. But there is some small differences, let me explain. The first two Nicasio bikes come with a -1 less stack/reach ratio. (which means the Nicasio 2 and Four Corners are slightly more upright) But all bikes are in that comfortable range for long days in the saddle. </p>



<p>The bottom bracket height is lower to the ground on the Nicasio by 16mm meaning it has a lower centre of gravity. Which would help it handle better under a load. This makes up for it having a shorter wheelbase, as the Four Corners is 81.8 mm longer. </p>



<p>The chainstay length is 420 mm on the Nicasio making it ride rather short for a gravel bike and may feel jumpy and quick in the rear. While the Four Corners is 450 mm which is longer for gravel bikes (and typical for a touring bike) making it feel chill and stable in the rear oppose to being quick. </p>



<p>Then you have the trail which differs from bike to bike. The Four Corners is shorter by 2 to 6 mm compared to the Nicasio models. This 61 mm trail puts the Four Corners in that mid range making the bike feel predictable in the front. While the Nicasio Plus is in that similar range with 63 mm, but the Nicasio 2 and Nicasio are in the higher end for trails. With the Nicasio 2 being a 67 mm making it rather stable, and the Nicasio base line model at 69 mm making it also stable but at the point of almost being sluggish in the front. </p>



<p>Overall if you want a bike for bikepacking with minimal gear, say up to 10 kg I would consider the Nicasio Plus or Nicasio 2. Depending on your budget. The Plus being cheaper and better for climbing. That is why I chose the Nicasio Plus. But it is all steel and if you want something slightly lighter weight the Nicasio 2 might be more for you. </p>



<p>Then obviously if you plan to bike tour with a full loaded setup and plan to ride roads and some off-road the Four Corners would be better for you. As the frame has been specifically designed to handle a heavier load of gear say over 10 kg and potentially up to 25 kg or more. The gear range is larger but still not as good as the Nicasio Plus for climbing, if you want to ride very steep MTB trails, thats is why I opted for the Nicasio +</p>
