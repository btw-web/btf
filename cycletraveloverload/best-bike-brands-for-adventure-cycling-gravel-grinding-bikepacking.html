<p>Adventure cycling has to be in my opinion the most exiting type of cycling! In this article we are going to breakdown some of the most popular bike brands in this niche. From bikepacking to touring and anything in between.</p>



<p>When you buy a bike you want to make sure you are purchasing quality. There are so many different bikes out there these days and some are obviously better then others. </p>



<p>When choosing a bike brand especially for this article we only picked what we believe are the best brands that offer bikes for exploring for days on end and are able to carry a load of gear. This means the bikes need to be built so they are stable and strong. But also have the ability to withstand some of the abuse that can be expected when in the middle of nowhere on rough roads. It helps if the bike is reliable and long lasting as you want a bike that is able to last especially if you are touring in the middle of no where. </p>



<p>All these brands make a number of bikes that are suited for this type of cycling. Offering options with a variety of materials from alloy, steel to carbon and titanium. While you can also pick up decent budget friendly bikes from some of these brands and even very highly spec&#8217;ed out bikes as well. </p>



<p>Please keep in mind that these bikes are in no particular order of preference. But all of them offer great bikes that are great for cycling to the corners of the world. </p>



<h2>Surly</h2>

<p>These guys have to be one of my favourite all time touring bike / bikepacking bike brand! Know for there all steel builds to their quirky &#8220;humanoid&#8221; descriptions and bike names! It is a brand that makes quality bikes for rather good prices but also has a unique character!</p>



<p>They are one of those brands solely dedicated to that more adventurous side of cycling and all there bikes have hauling abilities. One of my first touring bike was the Surly Long Haul Trucker! Love, Love, love this brand so much! Can you tell all ready? (Fan boy over here!)</p>



<p>The brands sense of humour is so laid back and relatable it is a really great way to market bikes. For example when I looked up their &#8220;about me&#8221; page this is what I mean. &#8220;Who is Surly? That’s a really great question. Who is anyone, really? Who are you? Who’s that guy? Why’s he walking towards us like that? Oh shit, now he’s running&#8230;&#8221; Everyone at Surly shares one thing in common and that is &#8220;bike nerdom.&#8221; They essentially make serious steel bikes for people who don’t take themselves too seriously. (That laid backness I was talking about)</p>



<p>Apart from this their bikes are simple yet so practical but also appealing and they just work! From the Surly LHT to the ECR or even Big Fat Dummy. They have a bike for any type of riding and bike adventure your creativity can muster. </p>

<p>Another great bike brand for the adventure seeker is Salsa! They are very similar to Surly when it comes to producing bikes that are great for travel the less rolled roads! But they do offer some wider variety of bike builds when it comes to materials and types of bikes. </p>



<p>Salsa started back in around 1981 to 1982 by Ross Shafer. Initially he focused on producing bicycle&nbsp;frames&nbsp;and custom&nbsp;stems. In 1997, the brand was acquired by&nbsp;Quality Bicycle Products. </p>



<p style="text-align:left">Salsa makes bike frames out of&nbsp;aluminum,&nbsp;carbon fiber,&nbsp;titanium,&nbsp;and&nbsp;chromoly steel.&nbsp;They build several bike touring bicycles, fat tire bikes, bikepacking bikes, and gravel bikes, as well as full-suspension mountain bikes and one model of gravel&nbsp;tandem.</p>



<p>They are all about adventuring by bike. So most if not all their bikes have the appropriate build components to be preferred bike exploring machines. With eyelets and adventure designed geometry. </p>



<p>One of their iconic all-road adventure bikes is the Salsa Fargo. My touring buddy has this bike and it is so bloody great! </p>

<p>Kona is another great adventure bike brand. They are not as niche specific and make other type of bikes too. But some of there bikes like their Kona Sutra LTD adventure/gravel bike is a beast! This is the bike I am currently riding and what more can I say this brand makes some great quality rigs. </p>



<p>They make bikes from mountain, gravel and all-road to electric bikes. They first started out making mountain bikes and are probably more known in the cycling community for mountain bikes. But as they know quiet a lot out Mountain biking they take this into their adventure bikes and you get the perfect mix! </p>



<p>In Kona&#8217;s words they are &#8220;all about the freedom and empowerment of the bicycle. We have been since 1988. We still have the same founding owners. We&#8217;re still populated by a staff of keen, active, impassioned cyclists. We&#8217;re not big, nor are we that small. Just a dedicated group of cyclists making bicycles for people who love bikes-no matter if that love is new or long established.&#8221;</p>



<p>Depending on your style Kona are more heavy into Mountain bikes as mentioned. But their best bikes for adventures are the Unit, Rove and Sutra models. </p>

<p>Similar to Cannondale, Specialized are also probably more popular in the road biking scene. But they also do have adventure and gravel bike options for the adventurous types! </p>



<p>Specialized is made by riders for riders. Since 1974. When quality tires weren&#8217;t around, they strove to make the best. When people wanted to ride cruisers in the dirt, they made the first production mountain bike. When roadies wanted to go faster, they doubled-down on carbon and built their own wind tunnel. And when kids were struggling to focus in school, they started the Specialized Foundation to help them through cycling. It is great to see a company do some good for the cycling community. </p>



<p>And they do this with the bikes the offer. Like the adventure/gravel Diverge bike! They also produce a number of other cycling products, like, shoes, helmets, apparel and bike bags. </p>

<p>Ibis are another one of those brands that make some nice high end gravel and mountain bikes which are amazing. From the Ripmo to the Ripley for MTB and the Hakka if you are after the ultimate lightweight gravel grinder. </p>



<p>On April Fools day of 1981, Scot Nicol ​“hung up his shin­gle” on a funky lit­tle shop a few miles east of Men­do­ci­no Cal­i­for­nia. On that day, 38 years ago, Ibis was start­ed with­out mon­ey and with­out a plan. Today they are locat­ed in San­ta Cruz with 26 (or so) peo­ple work­ing at Ibis. Our 5 own­ers all work full time for the com­pa­ny.</p>

<p>I loved this brand as a kid when I was into the skate culture but their bicycles are just as good. Not the best selection when it comes to adventure bikes but they do have many mountain bike options. Which some are great for bikepacking adventures. Oh yeah and they have the Stigmata Gravel/CX bike.</p>



<p>Santa Cruz Bicycles was founded in 1993 in a space the size of a single car garage in the Seabright Cannery, in Santa Cruz California. Their first bike, the Tazmon, was a single pivot dual suspension bike that rattled established sensibilities and helped define their then- ethos of &#8220;simply advanced.&#8221; That bike was the cornerstone for a brand that was founded on the notion of doing things their own way in order to build the best. They have been rattling sensibilities ever since. </p>

<p>Finally Norco they offer some really nice gravel bike options while also offering MTB. A Canadian brand they focus on producing super quality bikes. In carefully selecting components that complement their designs, they strive to meet high expectations for ride quality. And ensure that every one of their bicycles passes stringent standards for performance, aesthetic and quality.</p>



<p>Some of my favourite bikes from them are the, all new 2020 Section models, and the Search XR. </p>
