<p>Today we were spoiled by Svetlana and her girl friends. As soon as we arrived, they gave us tea with bread and jam and a large plate of rice. We are stuffed! But it&#8217;s not enough! We are invited to join the group and a glass of cognac is put in front of us. They tell many stories to us, all in Russion, we don&#8217;t understand a word, but keep laughing! By the time they leave, we both get big hugs! Friendly people!</p>

<p>Kyrgyzstan and horses is like Holland and wooden shoes. That&#8217;s the way it should be, one can&#8217;t do without the other. So, in order to feel the real life in Kyrgyzstan we decide a horse ride is the way to go. In two days we ride from Kochkor to Kol Okuk Lake and back, like Clint Eastwood and our own Dutch Anky! My God&#8230; we were soooo lucky it were only two days! Our asses are hurting like hell, a bicycle saddle is so much more comfortable&#8230; But the ride was worth it; from the valley we slowly (well Bonfire is) climb up over narrow trails through a green lush valley. Near the top it&#8217;s very steep and in order not to fall of, I hang on to its neck and on the downhill I nearly kiss its royal ass! How the hell does he (or she) do it? The pass is at 3100 meter and on the other side a beautiful valley opens up with Kol Okuk Lake and majestic mountains in the back. Near the lake are two yurts and it&#8217;s here where we will stay the night. It&#8217;s very primitive and hygiene is something they&#8217;ve never heard of&#8230; If we don&#8217;t get the shits again, we would be very surprised!</p>

<p>At 10 PM we finally have dinner; sheep soup we guess.. more bones than sheep. That night we find the rest of the sheep in a bowl next to our beds in our yurt&#8230; We have no idea where the head went&#8230;</p>
