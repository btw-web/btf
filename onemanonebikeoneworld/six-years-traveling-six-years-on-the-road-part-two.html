<p><span lang="en">Traveling doesn´t have only good sides. Especially if you are &#8211; like me &#8211; alone on the road for a long time.There is a price to pay for it. Positive falsified representations of a travelers life can be found on Facebook and Instagram too often. Only the staged, happy moments are shown, yearnings aroused with beach selfies and sunsets, giving the impression of living the dream of a globetrotter is always perfect and simple.<br />
The following is a (very personal) introspective. It is not about crying out my heart, but to show what negative consequences years and years of a nomadic lifestyle can have.</span></p>

<h3 lang="de-DE"><span lang="en"><b>Part two: The bad sides and the things I miss</b></span></h3>
<p><span lang="en"><b>Alone or lonely?</b></span></p>
<p><span lang="en"><i>&#8220;Are you alone?&#8221;</i></span><span lang="en"> Is probably one of the questions I´m asked most often. &#8220;</span><span lang="en"><i>Nah, I have my bike with me.&#8221;</i></span><span lang="en"> , I joke, but in many cultures there is a great lack of understanding for doing something alone or even wanting to be alone. For me, it is something normal and something I also appreciate. Even before this trip, I was very independent and also liked to spend time only with myself. And being alone doesn´t mean being lonely.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en"><i>&#8220;Aren´t you lonely after such a long time?&#8221;,</i></span><span lang="en"> other travelers ask me. &#8220;</span><span lang="en"><i>Sometimes, but that&#8217;s part of the journey</i></span><span lang="en">.&#8221;, is my standard answer.</span></p>
<p>There was no time to be lonely in the first years. I have never been longer than eight weeks in one country (except India) and almost never spent more than ten days in the same place. Most days I spent on the bike. Those times were exciting, so many things happened every day, I met so many people and had so many nice encounters. I didn´t think of my family and friends. Being away for a few months, or even a year or two, <span lang="en-US">i</span><span lang="en">s not so long.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">I was satisfied with the many short </span><span lang="en-US">interactions</span><span lang="en"> lasting only a few minutes or a day or a little longer. I enjoyed this anonymity that nobody knows you </span><span lang="de-DE">and how they</span> <span lang="de-DE">don´t </span><span lang="en">know anything about you.<br />
But I felt </span><span lang="en-US">like a stranger</span><span lang="en"> many times. </span><span lang="en-US">Except for</span><span lang="en"> a few countries east of Germany, everyone can see that you are from somewhere else. At the latest, when </span><span lang="en-US">the crowds grew bigger and bigger</span><span lang="en"> in Pakistan and India, </span><span lang="en-US">they</span><span lang="en"> admired me and my bike. </span><span lang="en-US">But</span><span lang="en"> I </span><span lang="en-US">also</span><span lang="en"> became more and more aware </span><span lang="en-US">of this notion that</span> <span lang="en-US">“</span><span lang="en">I&#8217;m not from here.</span><span lang="en-US">”</span><span lang="en"> It became more and more difficult to be alone and to avoid these sometimes stressful situations. In India, I was often happy to spend the night in a hotel, just closing the door behind me and having my own room &#8211; without any curious observers.</span></p>
<p>But loneliness? Not then, or at least not as often or as burdensome. But in recent years, the moments have become more frequent and an analysis of the situation makes it clear why:</p>

<p><span lang="en"><b>Loneliness has many faces</b></span><span lang="en"><br />
We humans are social beings. We are designed to live together </span><span lang="en-US">and</span><span lang="en"> to share our lives. Every person needs a certain amount of exchange, love, </span><span lang="en-US">and</span><span lang="en"> social contacts. People need other people, not just for reasons of survival. Even nomads live in family groups and don´t move around </span><span lang="en-US">solo</span><span lang="en">. The stories of the lonely Hermit in his cave may sound great, but few people seem to be suitable for such a life, at least not without paying a permanent price. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/well/mind/how-loneliness-affects-our-health.html"><span lang="en-US">E</span></a><span lang="en"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/well/mind/how-loneliness-affects-our-health.html">ven studies prove</a> that people are less happy and much more susceptible to diseases when the</span><span lang="de-DE">y</span><span lang="en"> don</span><span lang="de-DE">´t</span><span lang="en"> have sufficient social interaction.</span></p>
<p>Travelers, especially in Asian countries, are constantly surrounded by people and have many social encounters, but these are usually very short and superficial due to time constraints and language barriers. As a traveling cyclist, far away from the tourist trail, it sometimes <span lang="en-US">would take</span><span lang="en"> weeks to meet another foreigner or tourist to have a conversation in English or German again. It&#8217;s hard to express yourself </span><span lang="en-US">when</span><span lang="en"> nobody understands you and you don´t get input because you don´t understand the others. In the long run, this leads to </span><span lang="de-DE">a feeling of </span><span lang="en">isolation.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span lang="en"> It is often the case here in South America too. As long as my Spanish is not good enough to </span><span lang="de-DE">have</span><span lang="en"> or </span><span lang="de-DE">at least</span><span lang="en"> understand real, deeper conversations, I often disconnect internally in the presence of others. </span><span lang="en-US">I zone out b</span><span lang="en">ecause I don´t understand anything anyway or it is to hard to follow. </span><span lang="de-DE">I´m tired of not being able to express myself fully and </span><span lang="en-US">effortlessly</span><span lang="de-DE">. </span><span lang="en">I</span><span lang="de-DE">´m </span><span lang="en-US">often consumed with</span><span lang="en"> my thoughts </span><span lang="en-US">and I&#8217;m only</span><span lang="en"> physically present. </span><span lang="en-US">Then I usually</span><span lang="en"> withdraw myself from the social situation to be alone. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-US">W</span><span lang="en">hen I´m alone in nature, I don´t feel so lonely and I´m usually quite content. </span><span lang="en-US">But</span><span lang="en"> in the presence of other people, to whom I can´t build a proper connection, or in big cities where I </span><span lang="de-DE">don´t know anyone</span><span lang="en">, loneliness comes up more often.</span></p>

<p><span lang="en"><b>Friends and family</b></span><span lang="en"><br />
</span><span lang="en"><i>&#8220;Friends can be made anywhere!&#8221;</i></span><span lang="en"> I always say. Especially as a cyclist this is easy, because you get attention </span><span lang="de-DE">everywhere you go.</span> <span lang="en-US">Y</span><span lang="en">ou arouse interest, and apparently you are rarely perceived as a threa</span><span lang="de-DE">t</span><span lang="en">. </span><span lang="en-US">Because of this, It&#8217;s</span><span lang="de-DE"> easy to get in contact with people and to make friends.</span><span lang="en"> But these friendships are often short-lived and superficial </span><span lang="en-US">and</span> <span lang="de-DE">just</span><span lang="en"> last until I continue cycling. Even if I´m still in contact with people whom I</span><span lang="en-US">&#8216;ve</span><span lang="en"> encountered </span><span lang="en-US">with a </span><span lang="en">tru</span><span lang="en-US">ly</span><span lang="en"> deep friendship, it requires</span> <span lang="en">having </span><span lang="en-US">to</span><span lang="en"> spen</span><span lang="en-US">d</span><span lang="en"> time together </span><span lang="de-DE">to </span><span lang="en">h</span><span lang="en-US">ave</span><span lang="en"> shared experiences and memories. Often, only the </span><span lang="de-DE">first step</span><span lang="en"> for a friendship is </span><span lang="de-DE">made. </span><span lang="en-US">I</span><span lang="de-DE">f</span> <span lang="de-DE">I´m not going to meet</span><span lang="en"> the pe</span><span lang="de-DE">rson another time</span><span lang="en">, the contact will be lost. But sometimes it works out and I meet </span><span lang="de-DE">someone</span><span lang="en"> again and spend </span><span lang="de-DE">more </span><span lang="en">time with </span><span lang="de-DE">them</span><span lang="en">. And so a few </span><span lang="de-DE">deep</span><span lang="en"> friendships have emerged, which will probably last </span><span lang="en-US">for a lifetime</span><span lang="en">.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">And then there are the old friends, from home. After a few years on the road, I´m only in touch with a few in loose email contact. </span><span lang="en"><i>Stand-by friends</i></span><span lang="en"> I call those. When we meet again everything will be like it used to be (hopefully) . Until then everyone walks (or cycles) </span><span lang="en-US">their</span><span lang="en"> own way.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">When traveling, I´m almost never surrounded by good friends</span><span lang="en-US">;</span> <span lang="en-US">t</span><span lang="en">h</span><span lang="en-US">e people</span><span lang="en"> who know me well, who understand me, who can advise me, who can comfort me, who laugh and cry with me, </span><span lang="en-US">whom </span><span lang="de-DE">I can speak openly and don´t have to pretend anything, </span><span lang="en-US">are simply never there</span><span lang="de-DE">. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en">I&#8217;m on my own.</span></p>
<p>Keeping in touch with<span lang="de-DE">out</span><span lang="en"> Facebook is difficult these days. </span><span lang="de-DE">There are even people who don´t use email anymore. I</span><span lang="en-US">&#8216;ve had</span><span lang="en"> a smartphone for almost </span><span lang="de-DE">three</span><span lang="en"> years </span><span lang="de-DE">now </span><span lang="en">and use </span><span lang="de-DE">WhatsApp, </span><span lang="en-US">s</span><span lang="de-DE">o I hear about missed weddings and get baby photos sent. </span><span lang="en-US">I </span><span lang="de-DE">can see a little bit how my </span><span lang="en-US">friend&#8217;s</span> <span lang="en-US">lives</span><span lang="de-DE"> unfold.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en"><i>&#8220;Family?

<p><span lang="de-DE">Well,</span> <span lang="en-US">I met </span><span lang="en">my parents and one of my brothers in Indonesia three years ago, so it&#8217;s not that long.

<p><span lang="en"><b>And love?</b></span></p>
<p><span lang="en"><br />
&#8220;</span><span lang="en"><i>How is </i></span><span lang="de-DE"><i>it </i></span><span lang="en"><i>with </i></span><span lang="de-DE"><i>the</i></span><span lang="en"><i> love?</i></span><span lang="en">&#8221; </span><span lang="de-DE">i</span><span lang="en">s a question that is often </span><span lang="de-DE">asked</span><span lang="en"> more cautious</span><span lang="en-US">ly</span><span lang="en">, but i</span><span lang="de-DE">t´s</span><span lang="en"> justified. &#8220;</span><span lang="en"><i>My bike is my girlfriend,</i></span><span lang="en">&#8221; </span><span lang="de-DE">i</span><span lang="en">s another </span><span lang="en-US">one</span><span lang="en"> of those standard answers, but of course </span><span lang="de-DE">for </span><span lang="en">this article </span><span lang="de-DE">that </span><span lang="en">is not enough. I have </span><span lang="de-DE">to</span> <span lang="de-DE">speak </span><span lang="en">a bit more </span><span lang="en-US">personally.</span></p>
<p>First of all, it requires a definition of love or at least <span lang="en-US">the meaning of</span> <span lang="de-DE">longings and desires (or even needs)</span><span lang="en"> that every human being has. The </span><span lang="en-US">craving</span> <span lang="en">to be loved, respected and accepted, </span><span lang="en-US">to be</span><span lang="en"> understood. </span><span lang="de-DE">The longing for </span><span lang="en">closeness, warmth, </span><span lang="en-US">and</span><span lang="en"> affection. The desire for intimacy, for physical closeness, kissing, caresses, </span><span lang="de-DE">up</span><span lang="en"> to the desire to sleep with someone &#8211; to connect on this most intimate </span><span lang="en-US">physical </span><span lang="en"> level. The </span><span lang="de-DE">longing</span><span lang="en"> to give love. </span><span lang="de-DE">For </span><span lang="en">emotional balance. </span><span lang="de-DE">The longing for togetherness. For </span><span lang="en">a partner in life. Or </span><span lang="de-DE">the desire to want</span><span lang="en"> to sleep with many different partners (which is certainly not just a male </span><span lang="de-DE">desire</span><span lang="en">).</span></p>
<p>However, whatever the <span lang="de-DE">longings</span><span lang="en"> and desires </span><span lang="en-US">may be</span><span lang="en">, it is clear that </span><span lang="en"><i>everyone</i></span><span lang="en"> needs love and affection, </span><span lang="en-US">t</span><span lang="en">hat </span><span lang="de-DE">this</span><span lang="en"> is one of the essential energies </span><span lang="en-US">of</span><span lang="en"> life. </span><span lang="de-DE">It is more like a </span><span lang="en-US">necessity</span><span lang="de-DE"> in life than an optional thing.</span></p>
<p lang="de-DE">But to fulfil theses longings it doesn´t need a long relationship. If you are open for each other you can create intimacy in a short amount of time. You can learn to love someone without missing, without jealousy and without attachment. But that is easier said than done.</p>

<p lang="de-DE"><b>Lovesickness there is as well</b></p>
<p lang="de-DE">F<span lang="en">or a long time </span>m<span lang="en">y strategy was not to fall in love, </span><span lang="en-US">a</span><span lang="en">t least not too much. Easier said than done. </span><span lang="en-US">L</span><span lang="en">ove </span>doesn´t go <span lang="en">through the head but through the heart, </span><span lang="en-US">and the heart</span><span lang="en"> feels what it wants. </span></p>
<p lang="de-DE">Of course I felt in love but I <span lang="en-US">would</span> rather<span lang="en"> ke</span>pt<span lang="en"> a little distance </span><span lang="en-US">and not </span>get involved completely with<span lang="en"> someone, tr</span><span lang="en-US">ying</span><span lang="en"> to control the love. My freedom is important to me and it is often easier on my own. Also, the fear of being hurt plays a role because love is always connected with pain for me. </span></p>
<p lang="de-DE"><span lang="en">The urge to travel further was </span>always <span lang="en">stronger and more important. The longer I stayed with someone, the more painful and difficult was the separation. </span>The missing, and the doubts if my decision to leave was right. The sometimes uncomfortable knowledge that for me as a traveler it might be more easy than for the girl who stays in her normal surroundings. The lonely evenings in my tent, craving for being with my last love and at the same time knowing that I probably will never see her again.</p>
<p><span lang="en">So my relationships over the last six years have always been short-lived, </span><span lang="en-US">ranging f</span><span lang="en">rom a few days to two months. And yet, or just because of the short duration, </span><span lang="en-US">they were</span><span lang="en"> very intense. </span><span lang="en-US">I</span><span lang="en"> was </span><span lang="en-US">always</span><span lang="en"> in this initial phase of falling in love. </span><span lang="en-US">T</span><span lang="en">he other is still new and interesting and exotic, </span><span lang="en-US">and </span><span lang="en">one does not know one another well enough. </span><span lang="en-US">H</span><span lang="en">ormones suppress all doubts o</span><span lang="en-US">f</span><span lang="en"> the other and </span><span lang="en-US">they</span><span lang="en"> lull </span><span lang="en-US">you</span><span lang="en"> into the love-rush.</span></p>
<p><span lang="de-DE">I´m convinced </span><span lang="en">that </span><span lang="de-DE">the </span><span lang="en">models </span><span lang="en"><i>&#8220;one partner for life&#8221;</i></span><span lang="en"> and </span><span lang="en"><i>&#8220;only one partner at the same time&#8221;</i></span><span lang="en"> are </span><span lang="de-DE">for many people not the right ones</span><span lang="en">. </span><span lang="en-US">It is</span><span lang="en"> rather a romanticized ideal concept. </span><span lang="de-DE">I know that you can</span><span lang="en"> love several people at the same time </span><span lang="de-DE">and that </span><span lang="en">here is no perfect person who can meet all the needs one has. </span><span lang="de-DE">D</span><span lang="en">ivorce rates and the normality of cheating speak for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span lang="de-DE">B</span><span lang="en">ut what if I really want to make a firmer and longer </span><span lang="de-DE">relationship</span><span lang="en">? How do I deal with this after a couple of weeks when the first storm of love is weakened, the habit sets in, when my desire for change, for something new (rather a new one), drives me on, making the partner</span><span lang="de-DE"> even</span><span lang="en"> seem unattractive? I have not learned to deal with this in recent years.</span></p>

<p><span lang="en"><b>Search or </b></span><span lang="de-DE"><b>escape</b></span><span lang="en"><b>?</b></span></p>
<p><span lang="en"><br />
A journey is often a search <em>for</em> something or an escape <em>from</em> something, </span><span lang="en-US">o</span><span lang="en">r a mixture of both as </span><span lang="de-DE">it is for </span><span lang="en">me.

Especially if you want to </span><span lang="en-US">a</span><span lang="en">cross whole continents by bi</span><span lang="de-DE">cycle.</span><span lang="en"><br />
But it can also have negative aspects, </span><span lang="en-US">especially</span> <span lang="en-US">i</span><span lang="en">f you are never satisfied where you are right now. </span><span lang="en-US">You are a</span><span lang="en">lways chasing the next </span><span lang="de-DE">destination, </span><span lang="en-US">t</span><span lang="en">he next attraction, the next country.

<p><span lang="en"><b>The egocentric loner</b></span></p>
<p><span lang="en"><br />
Although the human being is a social being, </span><span lang="de-DE">it </span><span lang="en">is also very self-centered. If you spend a lot of time alone, not only is there a danger of becoming lonely but </span><span lang="en-US">there is </span><span lang="en">also </span><span lang="en-US">the danger of</span><span lang="en"> becoming selfish or self-centered. If you are traveling alone, you only have to make decisions for yourself. </span><span lang="en-US">Y</span><span lang="en">ou are only responsible for yourself </span><span lang="en-US">and</span><span lang="en"> you only have to think about yourself. There </span><span lang="de-DE">are not many</span><span lang="en"> compromise</span><span lang="de-DE">s to make </span><span lang="en-US">or</span><span lang="en"> no waiting for anyone, you are your own </span><span lang="de-DE">boss</span><span lang="en">.<br />
I&#8217;m used to these things, so sometimes I find it hard not to get impatient with others or in group situations. Alone it may be easier, but not necessarily </span><span lang="en-US">better</span><span lang="en">. Also, the more time you spend alone, the danger of becoming a </span><span lang="de-DE">little weird</span><span lang="en"> increases. And I&#8217;m not talking about </span><span lang="de-DE">talking to yourself</span><span lang="en"> here, that&#8217;s something that I still regard as quite normal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="en"><b>Alienation from home</b></span></p>
<p><span lang="en"><br />
</span><span lang="en"><i>&#8220;Dropout&#8221;, &#8220;</i></span><span lang="de-DE"><i>H</i></span><span lang="en"><i>ippie&#8221;, &#8220;Globetrotter&#8221;</i></span><span lang="en"> &#8211; that&#8217;s what people sometimes call me or I call myself for the sake of simplicity without really liking these labels. Travel</span><span lang="de-DE">ing</span> <span lang="de-DE">changes you</span><span lang="en"> &#8211; no question &#8211; and </span><span lang="en-US">it </span><span lang="en">expand</span><span lang="en-US">s</span> <span lang="de-DE">your</span><span lang="en"> horizon. It shows </span><span lang="de-DE">you</span><span lang="en"> a new perspective in life and </span><span lang="de-DE">your </span><span lang="en">own potential.</span></p>
<p><span lang="de-DE">In t</span><span lang="en">he first years I could still imagine living </span><span lang="de-DE">one day</span><span lang="en"> relatively &#8220;</span><span lang="en"><i>normal</i></span><span lang="en">&#8220;. </span><span lang="de-DE">That means </span><span lang="en-US">living</span><span lang="de-DE"> in </span><span lang="en-US">a</span><span lang="de-DE"> mainstream, capitalistic s</span><span lang="en-US">ociety</span> <span lang="en-US">with</span><span lang="en"> a full-time job. </span><span lang="de-DE">L</span><span lang="en">iving my life the way school and society prepared me </span><span lang="de-DE">for</span><span lang="en">. </span></p>
<p><span lang="de-DE">Today </span><span lang="en">I k</span><span lang="de-DE">now that </span><span lang="en">I do</span><span lang="de-DE">n´t</span><span lang="en"> want to go back there. Less and less I understand how people ca</span><span lang="en-US">n</span><span lang="en"> work so much and (in my view) perceive </span><span lang="de-DE">the world </span><span lang="en">so unconsciously. </span><span lang="de-DE">The understanding</span> <span lang="de-DE">for</span><span lang="en"> people who are not satisfied with their work </span><span lang="de-DE">life </span><span lang="en-US">nor</span><span lang="en"> their </span><span lang="de-DE">daily </span><span lang="en">life, but wh</span><span lang="de-DE">o don´t make a </span><span lang="en">change, decreases. The understanding of their (sometimes ridiculous) everyday problems and worries decreases and I find it more difficult to put myself in their position. Not that I feel better or smarter, this is not about arrogance – </span><span lang="en-US">this is because</span><span lang="en"> my experiences and circumstances in recent years have been so fundamentally different that a kind of alienation has occurred. A simple life without big financial worries, without obligations and most of the time freely </span><span lang="de-DE">decidable</span><span lang="en"> is already very different than the life of an average German. In addition, </span><span lang="de-DE">all the</span><span lang="en"> time I spent in recent years with similar thinking, similar living people: </span><span lang="en-US">t</span><span lang="en">ravelers, alternative</span><span lang="en-US">s</span><span lang="en">, hippies, freaks, </span><span lang="de-DE">rainbow family&#8230;</span><span lang="en"> This can lead to fee</span><span lang="de-DE">l</span><span lang="en"> like </span><span lang="de-DE">in</span><span lang="en"> a parallel society or even </span><span lang="en-US">a</span><span lang="en"> parallel world and </span><span lang="de-DE">can</span><span lang="en"> increase the distance to other people. In the worst case</span><span lang="en-US">s</span><span lang="en">, even condemning and demarcating thoughts emerge: &#8220;</span><span lang="en"><i>They still eat so much meat &#8211; do they know nothing about climate change?</i></span><span lang="en">&#8221; Or &#8220;</span><span lang="en"><i>Do they still </i></span><span lang="de-DE"><i>not</i></span><span lang="en"><i> understand that the latest smartphone does</i></span><span lang="de-DE"><i>n´t</i></span><span lang="en"><i> necessarily make them happier?</i></span><span lang="en">&#8221;<br />
By then you can not only speak of alienation but also of a position of arrogance, which is to be corrected.</span></p>
<p>W<span lang="de-DE">ell,</span><span lang="en"> alienation works in both directions. </span><span lang="en-US">I</span><span lang="en">t only depends on the perspective. I often see </span><span lang="de-DE">other</span><span lang="en"> people as alienated from nature, </span><span lang="de-DE">from </span><span lang="en">themselves and </span><span lang="de-DE">from</span><span lang="en"> life in general, and </span><span lang="de-DE">other </span><span lang="en">people see me as alienated from their normal life </span><span lang="de-DE">and their reality.</span><span lang="en"><br />
After such a long time on the road and the change of perspectives and views, I often wonder how it will be when I return to my old environment, ie friends and family in Germany. How will I react and how </span><span lang="en-US">will </span><span lang="en">the people who may not have changed so much? W</span><span lang="en-US">ill</span><span lang="en"> there be confrontations? Will I adapt or w</span><span lang="de-DE">on´t</span><span lang="en"> I fit in there anymore?</span></p>

<p><span lang="en"><br />
I miss having a permanent home. My own space </span><span lang="en-US">with</span><span lang="en"> my own little kingdom.</span></p>
<p>I miss social relationships that <span lang="de-DE">last</span><span lang="en"> longer than just a few days and which are more profound than pure acquaintances.</span></p>
