The rain patters on my tent. More specifically, on my plastic tarp which I luckily could set up above it. Now </span>the rain<span lang="en"> has </span>finally <span lang="en">caught me, the notorious rain of Patagonia. The last three weeks on the Carretera were pleasant, and contrary to the predictions of other cyclists, largely free of rain. Only at night had the sky opened its doors a few times.<br />
I pitched my camp by a river. On the other shore is Hornopiren, just two </span>or three days cycling <span lang="en">from Puerto Montt, the city where the Carretera Austral begins or, </span>in my case,<span lang="en"> will end. Four days ago, the rain started in Chaiten, about 150 km south of here. A prediction of </span>7<span lang="en">0 mm in 24 hours had led me to spend a day in the tent and cycle the remaining 70 km to the ferry to Hornopiren the next, less rainy, day.</span></p>

<p>The northern part of the Carretera is also impressive. In parts more populated, in parts wild and lonely.<span lang="en"> The road is mostly asphalted, which makes progress a little easier, yet the many climbs cost strength and let the stomach regularly demand replenishment.

Even four months after the accident, the cleanup is still in full swing.

<p><span lang="en"><b>Three fish for the cyclist</b></span></p>
<p>One evening I find myself setting camp<span lang="en"> under a bridge </span>at a river<span lang="en">. Due to mispla</span>nning<span lang="en"> on my part I only have</span> <span lang="en">rice and lentils </span>left<span lang="en"> in my food bag, </span>I <span lang="en">even </span>have run out of spices and I couldn´t reach the next settlement with a shop.<span lang="en"> I&#8217;ve arranged myself with my simple meal when three anglers come out of the bushes and walk to their car. They see me and wave </span>at me<span lang="en">. </span><span lang="en"><i>&#8220;Should they have a problem with me camping here?&#8221;</i></span> s<span lang="en">ays the doubting voice in my head, </span><span lang="en"><i>&#8220;Or do </i></span><i>they</i><span lang="en"><i> want to give me a fish?&#8221;</i></span> a<span lang="en">sks the hopeful </span>one<span lang="en">. My hopes are exceeded when the nice men give me three fish, two salmon and a trout, plus some bread. Overjoyed with this unexpected enrichment of my dinner, I start collecting wood for a fire to prepare the fish w</span>ith<span lang="en"> style. Wild Patagonian salmon, freshly caught and grilled over the fire, what could be better?</span></p>

<p lang="de-DE"><span lang="en">The next morning I </span>continue<span lang="en">, but the first clouds already hint at the coming rain, which will eventually lead to my isolation in the tent in </span>Hornopiren<span lang="en">. I spend four days and nights there until a better weather forecast and better condition of my muscles allow me </span>continue for the<span lang="en"> last two days of the Carretera Austral. I had decided against a hostel, but </span>took <span lang="en">the possibility of a hot shower at the tourist information Hornopiren. And I h</span>ad written some requests<span lang="en"> for a couchsurfing host near Puerto Montt where I want to spend a few days.</span></p>
<p>With this in mind<span lang="en"> it is easier to cycle, to reach the next geographical destination, finishing this section. The road often runs along the sea, dolphins jump out of the water and big birds of prey are circling, the climbs are getting smaller and traffic is getting bigger. </span></p>

<p lang="de-DE"><span lang="en">Upon my arrival, the story of the flat tire, with which the Carretera had begun i</span>s about to close<span lang="en">. Only a few </span>kilometres before<span lang="en"> my destination, it&#8217;s already evening, my rear tire is flat. I can</span>´t<span lang="en"> find the hole, but I have a replacement </span>tube<span lang="en">. Th</span>at<span lang="en"> one that I found surprisingly in a hut, new and unused, left behind by another cyclist. The </span>tube is<span lang="en"> installed quickly and the rear wheel is reinstalled. Only the air is still missing and somehow the pump </span>doesn´t seem<span lang="en"> to work, the </span>tube doesn´t fill<span lang="en"> but the air just disappears. </span>When I<span lang="en"> take a closer look, I notice that the interior of the valve of the t</span>ube<span lang="en"> is missing. The valve is just an empty metal </span>tube and<span lang="en"> no valve which holds the air i</span>nside the tube<span lang="en">. Annoyed and frustrated and </span>also <span lang="en">a little disbelieving I stand there. Has another cyclist left behind these defective or incorrectly produced t</span>ubes knowingly? <span lang="en">Why didn</span>´t<span lang="en"> I look better? Or has this inside piece fallen out and </span>is <span lang="en">somewhere in my bike bag? T</span>here is nothing I can do<span lang="en">, there is only one solution. I have to push my bike inwardly cursing the last few k</span>ilometers<span lang="en"> to Claudia&#8217;s house. Since I </span>don´t want<span lang="en"> to damage my rim, I </span>stuff my<span lang="en"> backpack </span>full<span lang="en">, put it on, and load the rest of the luggage on the front wheel. Lifting the flat rear wheel and pushing the front wheel with the other hand on the handlebar, I m</span>ake my way meter by meter<span lang="en">, pausing again and again. Finally, t</span>ired but with joy<span lang="en">, I arrive at Claudia. The last challenge of the Carretera Austral is </span>accomplished.</p>
<p>Since Claudia works during the day, I have my own little kingdom. Can spend all day lazy in front of the computer, boil<span lang="en"> coffee at the touch of a button and </span>can recover<span lang="en"> unimpressed by the rain and wind out there. I can wash my clothes, take a shower every day and use all the advantages of a kitchen in the evening and fulfill my food dreams not only for myself, but also spend s</span>ocial<span lang="en"> and satisfying evenings with Claudia and her friends.</span></p>
