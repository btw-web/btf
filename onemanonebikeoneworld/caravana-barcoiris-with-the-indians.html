<p lang="de-DE"><span lang="en">We start usually at sunrise and have breakfast on the boat as soon as we are in the current. Occasionally we row to get a faster current or to cross the river, but often we just let ourselves drift. We have a river map with all the villages listed. Tinka had photographed and printed them out in the Capitaneria in Pucallpa.<br />
In the afternoon we look for a village. We never know what to expect, how big the village is, whether it is an indigenous community, whether we can stay.</span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6223" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanonebikeoneworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/yasawa_small141.jpg?resize=1024%2C502&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="502" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanonebikeoneworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/yasawa_small141.jpg?resize=1024%2C502&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanonebikeoneworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/yasawa_small141.jpg?resize=300%2C147&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanonebikeoneworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/yasawa_small141.jpg?resize=768%2C376&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanonebikeoneworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/yasawa_small141.jpg?resize=830%2C406&amp;ssl=1 830w, https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanonebikeoneworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/yasawa_small141.jpg?resize=230%2C113&amp;ssl=1 230w, https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanonebikeoneworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/yasawa_small141.jpg?resize=350%2C171&amp;ssl=1 350w, https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanonebikeoneworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/yasawa_small141.jpg?resize=480%2C235&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanonebikeoneworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/yasawa_small141.jpg?resize=1320%2C646&amp;ssl=1 1320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.onemanonebikeoneworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/yasawa_small141.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

The children always come first and marvel at the newcomers in their strange boat from a safe distance.

To break the ice, Robin takes out his guitar and starts playing. Aurelio has picked up his juggling balls and throws them into the air. The children come a little closer. They are rarely really scared. At least they should know white people from television. And after all, this is the Amazon, the highway under the rivers.</span></p>

<p lang="de-DE"><span lang="en">Most of the time we get permission and a dry place to sleep. Often there is still time to make some music or to make friends with the villagers. After some initial shyness they are very helpful, give us food without asking and offer their houses for cooking.</span></p>

<p lang="de-DE"><span lang="en">Some villages are made up of just five families, others have a few hundred residents or even a thousand. The houses are made of wood, mostly built on stilts, because the level of the river varies greatly throughout the year. The corrugated iron roofs have replaced the palm leaves almost everywhere and are well suited to collect rainwater. If it stays dry for a long time or people don&#8217;t have a water tank, they resort to the river. Electricity in the smaller villages is only available with diesel generators, which are usually turned on for a few hours in the evening. To have light and for satellite television.</span></p>
<p>The school is often the only brick building, financed by a government program, just like the football field, which no village should be without. On the other hand, the teachers are missing sometimes and the children either have to get to the next larger village or simply don&#8217;t go to school.<br />
Our offer to do something in schools is always well received. It is a good change for the children and also for the teachers.</p>

<p lang="de-DE"><span lang="en"><b>The plastic monster comes to visit</b></span></p>
<p>We visit the school in an Indian village on a small tributary of the Amazon and offer our services to the director. A few English lessons are quickly arranged, plus a slackline workshop and music program. And the first theatrical performance of the plastic monster. In front of around a hundred schoolchildren, Aurelio plays the plastic monster, which feeds on garbage and poisons air, water and earth. I have taken on the role of the reader and I tell the story of the greedy mankind who exploits the raw materials and poisoned the planet with petroleum. Yaku, Sacha and Wayra, the protective spirits of the river, forest and wind, are played by Tinka and can finally free the plastic monster from trash and show him how to sort and recycle the trash.</p>

<p lang="de-DE"><span lang="en">A simple message but a necessary one. Because no one here lives outside the monetary system and with money come all the products, wrapped in plastic. In the village shop, everything is put in a plastic bag again. Packaging plastic is then dropped where it is no longer needed. Biscuit packs line the sidewalks, empty bottles and plastic bags, washing powder bags are disposed of directly at the river. There are exactly three options for waste disposal: burning, burying, or throwing into the river. What would be the least harmful? Avoiding garbage from the start.</span></p>
<p lang="de-DE">And it comes from the outside world. With the lanchas, the cargo ships that deliver the products and supply the entire Amazon. These are then distributed from the cities to the villages. There is always at least one shop where you can buy basic food such as rice and pasta. You can always find sugar, flour and cookies. Soft drinks and water in plastic bottles. Shampoo and detergent too. Gasoline is also bought for the boat engine and the power generator for satellite television and smartphones.</p>
<p lang="de-DE">Nevertheless, the people here are comparatively low consumers. Most of the food consumed is grown on cleared forest clearings. Yuca, corn, bananas. In addition, fish from the river and everything that moves in the forest can be shot with a rifle.</p>
<p lang="de-DE">After the play, the garbage collection starts. Captain Robin carries a plastic sack and is surrounded by children who are moving through the village and collect plastic waste. Then comes the second part. Tinka stands on the soccer field, which is also the village square, and demonstrates the construction of an <em>ecoladrillo</em>, an eco-brick. The rubbish is stuffed into plastic bottles and pressed together with the help of a stick. This creates stable waste packages that can be used as building materials like bricks. Or to frame a garden or young plants.</p>

<p lang="de-DE">It is only a temporary solution. If the garbage is already there, at least keep it together and use it for something. Better than burning it or throwing it into the river, but what is the likelihood that the villages will continue the practice once demonstrated? And then use the ecoladrillos too? And don&#8217;t you just keep the memory of the crazy shoe-free gringos with their idea of ​​the plastic bottle house?</p>

In the past, all families of a tribe lived together in the Maloka. Each family had their private area on the outer edge, while the large square in the middle was shared. </span><span lang="en-AU">Here the men of the village </span><span lang="de-DE">are gathered</span> <span lang="de-DE">p</span><span lang="en-AU"><i>ara mambear</i></span><span lang="en-AU">, to take </span><span lang="en-AU"><i>Mambe</i></span><span lang="en-AU"> and talk. Mambe, the green powder of roasted and dust-crushed coca leaves mixed with the ashes of another </span><span lang="en-AU">plant, has traditionally been produced and consumed for a long time. To strengthen the stimulating effect, the men smear</span><span lang="en-AU"><i> ambil</i></span><span lang="en-AU">, a tobacco paste, in the cheek </span><span lang="de-DE">before</span><span lang="en-AU"> a spoonful of mambe </span><span lang="de-DE">follows</span><span lang="en-AU">.

Huitoto is spoken here, the tribal language of the </span><span lang="de-DE">only less than 10000 Huitotos</span><span lang="en-AU"> spread throughout the Amzanos area. It&#8217;s about the festival in the other Maloka. Because in this village also </span><span lang="de-DE">live </span><span lang="en-AU">the Boras, another tribe. The village is divided, each tribe remains more among themselves. </span><span lang="de-DE">E</span><span lang="en-AU">ven if there are no conflicts, </span><span lang="de-DE">t</span><span lang="en-AU">he festival should improve relations and take place in the Maloka of </span><span lang="de-DE">the </span><span lang="en-AU"> Boras.
