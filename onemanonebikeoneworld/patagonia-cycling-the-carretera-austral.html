<p><span lang="en">The air is </span><span lang="de-DE">gone</span><span lang="en">. Not only am I flat</span><span lang="de-DE">tened</span><span lang="en"> after the Paso Rio Mayer, but also my front tire </span><span lang="de-DE">is</span><span lang="en">. No </span><span lang="de-DE">big </span><span lang="en">problem, after all I have</span><span lang="de-DE"> a</span><span lang="en"> repair kit and even a replacement </span><span lang="de-DE">tube</span><span lang="en">. And the front wheel is easier to remove than the rear wheel. The panniers are quickly removed, the brake released, the screw released and the front wheel removed. The bike simply balances on the fork while I loosen the </span><span lang="de-DE">tire</span><span lang="en"> and take </span><span lang="de-DE">out </span><span lang="en">the </span><span lang="de-DE">inner tube</span><span lang="en">. Sounds </span><span lang="de-DE">like </span><span lang="en">routine, but it would be a lie if I would claim to have done this procedure many times. The Marathon Mondial tires do</span><span lang="de-DE">n´t</span> <span lang="de-DE">get bothered by many</span><span lang="en"> things and </span><span lang="de-DE">also</span><span lang="en"> this time it is not a screw or nail, but the </span><span lang="de-DE">tube </span><span lang="en">is torn at the valve. Exactly the same problem I have had twice in recent times, most recently in Buenos Aires and before that at the airport in Auckland, where I did</span><span lang="de-DE">´t</span><span lang="en"> have a spare </span><span lang="de-DE">tube</span><span lang="en">, but a bicycle shop was within walking distance. The rim tape seems to shift and this causes the </span><span lang="de-DE">tube</span><span lang="en"> to rub against the sharp metal edge of the rim valve opening and I have</span><span lang="de-DE">n´t</span><span lang="en"> yet found a satisf</span><span lang="de-DE">ying</span><span lang="en"> solution. Such a </span><span lang="de-DE">puncture</span><span lang="en"> is difficult to </span><span lang="de-DE">repair</span><span lang="en"> and I decide directly for the </span><span lang="de-DE">spare tube</span><span lang="en">. </span><span lang="de-DE">Around </span><span lang="en">the valve I wrap, as a precaution, a piece of old </span><span lang="de-DE">rubber tube </span><span lang="en">for </span><span lang="de-DE">more protection</span><span lang="en">. After a short while the journey continues, only to end a few hundred meters again. This time it is not the valve, but the </span><span lang="de-DE">tube</span><span lang="en"> is torn directly over a length of three centimeters. This is called bad luck &#8211; or poor quality. My best chances are to </span><span lang="de-DE">fix </span><span lang="en">the other </span><span lang="de-DE">tube</span><span lang="en"> at the valve. I cut a hole in </span><span lang="de-DE">a</span><span lang="en"> patch and </span><span lang="de-DE">glue</span><span lang="en"> it over the valve, hoping to get everything tight. It seems to work, </span><span lang="de-DE">to hold</span><span lang="en"> the air. At least for 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span lang="de-DE">It´s still</span><span lang="en"> thirty kilometers to Villa O`Higgins. And </span><span lang="de-DE">the last</span><span lang="en"> night I </span><span lang="de-DE">ate up </span><span lang="en">all my supplies, assuming that I could quickly get into </span><span lang="de-DE">a shop </span><span lang="en">today. If I </span><span lang="de-DE">don´t want</span><span lang="en"> to ask for food at one of the few houses, or one of the few cars for a ride, I have only one thing left: Pumping, cycling for as long as 20 minutes until the tire is flat, pumping, cycling, pumping, cycling. My arm </span><span lang="de-DE">hurts because of the pumping</span><span lang="en"> and next time </span><span lang="de-DE">I will buy </span><span lang="en">a more expensive two-way pump, which pumps </span><span lang="de-DE">air when pulled and</span><span lang="en"> pressed</span></p>

<p> <span lang="en">So it takes </span><span lang="de-DE">me</span><span lang="en"> a while until I reach my destination exhausted and hungry, more precisely I stop already 200 meters before the village. Here is </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/tsonek/?rc=p"><span lang="en"><i>Tsoneks Eco Camp</i></span></a><span lang="en">, and I had already decided to ask if I could </span><span lang="de-DE">help out a little bit and then</span><span lang="en"> camp for free. </span><span lang="de-DE">I´m really looking forward to a good shower and some comfort.</span><span lang="en"> The Eco Camp is located in the forest and consists of a community lodge, a building with composting toilets and small homemade huts made of earth and recycled material. Here I meet Max, a German whom I had met before in El Chalten and who volunteered here for a few weeks. He tells me that the owner is not there at the moment and that he is responsible. Even before I have expressed my question about the possibility of helping out, he says &#8220;Sure! Yesterday another volunteer left, no problem at all. &#8220;Not only can I get a place to sleep but I also get free food. In return, I help to keep the community facilities clean and take a few pictures for </span><span lang="de-DE">the</span><span lang="en"> Ecocamp&#8217;s website.</span></p>

<p><span lang="en">The next morning I walk </span><span lang="de-DE">in</span><span lang="en">to the villageVilla O&#8217;Higgins. A few hundred people live here, most probably from tourism.

<p><span lang="en">At the </span><span lang="en"><i>Lago Gral Carrera</i></span><span lang="en"> the road </span><span lang="de-DE">splits</span><span lang="en"> and you can turn left around the lake to </span><span lang="en"><i>Cerro Castillo</i></span><span lang="en"> or right around the lake to </span><span lang="en"><i>Chile Chico</i></span><span lang="en"> and </span><span lang="de-DE">from there</span><span lang="en"> take a ferry to get back on the Carretera. I decide for this variant, following the advice of Lothar. The beautiful views over the lake keep his promise, but apparently he forgot to mention that the road is just up and down and the climbs are particularly steep. Also, the tailwind will not </span><span lang="de-DE">blow</span><span lang="en"> and so I curse my choice of route </span><span lang="de-DE">already</span><span lang="en"> after 30 kilometers. </span></p>

<p lang="de-DE"><span lang="en">But then, in the distance, I see a lonely figure sitting by the lake, and as I approach, a bicycle is leaning against a fence. Jacob is just as finished as me.

On the Ruta 40 </span><span lang="de-DE">he went</span><span lang="en"> on the Argentine side to the north, always against the wind.

He wants to convince me to </span><span lang="de-DE">join</span><span lang="en"> his direction, left around the lake, but if I think of the ascents and descents of the last 30 kilometers, I don</span><span lang="de-DE">´t</span><span lang="en"> want to do that again. But we arrange to meet in Coyhaique a week later, because he is also on the way to the north.</span></p>

<p lang="de-DE"><span lang="en">It is probably one of the most exhausting routes on my trip and I&#8217;m glad when I arrive in </span><span lang="en"><i>Chile Chico</i></span><span lang="en">. From there a ferry </span><span lang="de-DE">crosses</span><span lang="en"> over the lake and there is an asphalt road waiting for me. When I push my bike off the ferry, I greet with a nod two other cyclists and continue. I hear someone shout</span><i> </i><span lang="de-DE"><i>&#8220;Schmale!&#8221;</i></span> <span lang="de-DE">b</span><span lang="en">ehind me. That ca</span><span lang="de-DE">n´t</span><span lang="en"> be, who knows me here, and then </span><span lang="de-DE">even </span><span lang="en">my last name. With a big grin, a guy comes up to me. </span><span lang="en"><i>&#8220;I know you, I know your brother, in Germany!&#8221; </i></span><span lang="de-DE">h</span><span lang="en">e</span><span lang="en"> tells me. I have no idea, but it turns out that Julian is a friend of my little brother and used to </span><span lang="de-DE">be at our house back</span><span lang="en"> home.</span><span lang="de-DE">Together with his girlfriend he cycled down from </span><span lang="en">Colombia. And of course he knows about my trip, knows my blog and then actually recognizes me in this unexpected encounter. We take a picture together and then the two have to go on the ferry and I stay </span><span lang="de-DE">behind, puzzled and </span><span lang="en">perplexed. What are the chances of meeting someone from your </span><span lang="de-DE">town</span> <span lang="de-DE">randomly somewhere in South America</span><span lang="en">? These two encounters, with Jacob and Julian, </span><span lang="de-DE">let me see more sense </span><span lang="en">in my decision to choose this route.</span></p>

<p><span lang="de-DE">The asphalted road curves up a pass</span><span lang="en">, and then </span><span lang="de-DE">it´s</span><span lang="en"> only downhill for hours. The difference in altitude is not huge, but the road has only a very small slope which goes on for quite a while before I find myself in the catchment area of the 50,000-inhabitant city of Coyhaique. The wild mountain landscape becomes fenced pastures and the traffic increases steadily as I get closer to the city. It&#8217;s weird to see so many people, </span><span lang="de-DE">to</span><span lang="en"> shop in a huge supermarket and </span><span lang="de-DE">to have to watch for</span><span lang="en"> traffic lights and </span><span lang="de-DE">cars</span><span lang="en">. I want to continue </span><span lang="de-DE">soon</span><span lang="en">, but my body needs a little rest first.</span></p>
