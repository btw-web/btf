<h1>A Bike (Fly) Fishing Primer</h1>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4640898012_06f4e71cd6.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Let me just preface this by saying that I am by no means a salty haired veteran angler.  I read Hemmingway&#8217;s &#8220;Old Man and the Sea&#8221; and saw more religious imagery than fishing tips.  However, I have been doing a fair amount of fishing the last few months and have been experimenting with equipment while on tour.  So fellow potential bike-fishers here is what I&#8217;ve found works for me and why I&#8217;m using the things I use.<br />
<strong><br />
Why Fly Fishing?</strong></p>
<p>The first question has to be why fly fishing over traditional spinner rod and bait fishing.  One obvious advantage is that when you&#8217;re fly fishing you&#8217;re using imitation bait (fake flies, worms, bait fish).  This means you don&#8217;t have to worry about carrying a Styrofoam container of worms, crickets or other critters with you on your bike.  Instead, you can carry all the REUSABLE bait and lures you need in a reasonably small tackle box.</p>
<p>Another reason why I chose fly fishing is that it&#8217;s still fun to practice even if there isn&#8217;t a fish or a drop of water around.  Fly fishing is one of those activities (like cycling) that is simplistic but has a multitude of nuances.  On non-fishing days, I&#8217;ll assemble the rod and tie on a fly (without a hook) and practice casting distance and accuracy.  I&#8217;ll aim for my helmet at 25 feet and progressively increase the distance.  It makes for a great camp game.  I&#8217;ve recently taken on learning how to cast with my non dominant left hand in the event I encounter some windy days that threaten to blow a hook in my face &#8211; plus its just great fun.</p>

<p>Another reason to fly fish is that fly fishing tackle is extremely versatile.  If I had a dollar for every time I&#8217;ve heard &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t you be in Colorado fishing for trout&#8221; in the short time I&#8217;ve been fly fishing &#8211; well, I&#8217;d have enough money to be in Colorado fishing for trout.  Perhaps it was <em>The River Runs Through It</em> that has permanently associated fly fishing with bucolic mountain streams, but fly fishing on lakes, ponds and less than pristine bodies of water is still great fun.  I&#8217;ve managed to catch a variety of panfish, bass and even a catfish &#8211; fish that aren&#8217;t normally associated with fly fishing.  I have even found people online that catch carp on the fly in the Los Angeles River!  </p>

<p><strong>A Good Starter Kit</strong></p>
<p>When we were in Fortworth, TX, we went to a <a href="http://www.backwoods.com">Backwoods </a>store (a sort of high end REI) and I met Stephen &#8211; the fly shop manager of that Backwoods.  Stephen is from England and through a turn of events now finds himself in Texas.  He LOVES fly fishing.  In our travels, I have met very few people that actually like what they do.  His enthusiasm for the sport rubbed off on me, a complete novice, and within a few minutes of talking he had me handling a practice fly rod swinging it back and forth in the store.</p>
<p>We went over the gear options and we boiled down what would be practical for our bike tour.  I essentially needed a good all-rounder fly rod that could handle multiple types of fish (panfish, small bass and trout) and water (streams, creeks, lakes).  Most of the fish I would be trying to catch would be from small to medium in size (no 40lb behemoths).  </p>
<p>With those parameters, he suggested the Temple Fork Outfitters NXT 5/6wt rod kit &#8211; a split weight rod that could take a 5wt or 6wt line.  Fly rods and line come in various weights (to put it simplistically a 1wt is for tiny fish in tiny water &#8211; 12wt for big saltwater fish) and the 5/6wt was right in the middle.  The rod would be plenty big for your average panfish, a good match for medium size bass and trout.</p>
<p>The TFO NXT kit comes complete with the case, rod, reel and line (backing, floating line, leader and tippet) for about $200.  If you tried to purchase the individual parts separately, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to put together a comparable package for the same price. </p>

<p><strong>Other Things You&#8217;ll Need</strong></p>
<p>Outside of the reel, rod and line, there are a few more items that you&#8217;ll need to fly fish, flies being chief among them.  If you thought rods and reels were overwhelming, there are a staggering amount of fly patterns out there.  I&#8217;m not going to go into the minutiae of &#8220;matching the hatch&#8221; here  (flyspeak for looking at the bugs around you and picking an imitation that matches).  I will tell you this, there is one fly pattern that I have used that I have caught nearly all my fish on and that is the Woolly Bugger.  The woolly bugger doesn&#8217;t really look exactly like a particular thing, but it does look close enough to many things that fish eat.  Depending on size, it could imitate a small insect, a leech or even small bait fish.  It is so versatile that it is suggested that if you have no idea what fly to use or what you&#8217;re doing exactly, you should use the WB.  Going on this terse and simple advice, I&#8217;ve caught a varying amount of fish with it.  My woolly bugger of choice is one that is tied on a size 10 hook (sort of medium-small), that is olive and has some flash on it (sparkly material that improves visibility in murky water).  Buy them by the handful, because if you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ll lose a fair number to treefish and rockfish on your first attempts.</p>
<p>Other bits of gear I&#8217;d recommend are a pair of forceps to help in separating flies from fish.  Using forceps will let you get into small mouths of certain fish without manhandling a fish&#8217;s internals more than you have to.  A nail clipper is another good thing to have around to help cut off the tag ends of your fishing line.  A hat is essential in keeping the sun off you. I prefer wide brim hats since they keep more sun off but also because they may save your ears from a foul hook (more flyspeak for hooking yourself in the ear).  When I fish, I also wear a lightweight longsleeve shirt for the same reasons. Extra tippet and leader material is a must.  Every time you tie a fly you lose an inch or two of your tippet (the really thin monofilmaent that you tie to your fly).</p>
<p><strong>Take A Class!</strong></p>
<p>I was fortunate that Stephen, the fly shop manager, also happened to be teaching a class the next morning.  Without the class, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d still be fishing today having given up in frustration many weeks ago.  The class I took was $75 and was five hours long, covering casting, where fish live and fly tying &#8211; well worth the investment if you&#8217;re serious.</p>
<p>The mechanics of casting aren&#8217;t that hard, but it does take a lot of practice to execute it smoothly.  Getting some formal instruction on how to do it will go a long way in your future enjoyment of the sport, trust me.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellanea</strong><br />
Next to decent fly shops, information on where/how to get a non-resident fishing license is difficult to locate.  I&#8217;ve found that in some states, local bait shops no longer sell licenses and you HAVE to go to a Walmart to get one which becomes a logistical problem if you&#8217;re on bike.  Some states like Louisiana and Mississippi have a wonderful system where you can call a phone number to add fishing days to your license.</p>
<p>Regarding my equipment, I&#8217;m supremely happy with everything I&#8217;ve purchased from Backwoods and Stephen.  I think a 5/6 weight rod is a versatile rod for the varied types of water and fish you&#8217;ll encounter on an around the US bike tour.  The only thing I would change, in fact, would be to probably get a travel specific rod.  My current one breaks down to 4 pieces, something like the Orvis Frequent Flyer or Cabela&#8217;s 7 piece rod would fit better on the bike.  I haven&#8217;t tried those specifically, so I can&#8217;t speak to how they are for fishing, but their small compact size are definitely more desirable for touring. </p>
<p><strong>Thoughts After a Few Months of Bike (Fly) Fishing</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m completely aware that carrying a fly rod on a bike tour does seem like quite a decadent and eccentric thing to do, but I love it.  Before, when we would camp next to a river or lake I would only interact with the water by taking pictures of it (I&#8217;m not a swimmer at all).  Now, by the act of fishing, I enjoy our surroundings on a whole different level.  I look at the depth and speed of the water, I look if any fish are breaching the surface, what bugs are floating around in the air, I look for logs, weed beds or other structures that fish may hide.  </p>
<p>As with any new skill or bit of knowledge that you acquire in life, it enriches and colors the way you relate to the world at large.  I&#8217;ve also enjoyed how it opens conversations with locals.  When I pull out the fly rod on lakes in the The South its different and people come and talk to me about it.  </p>
<p>Is it for everyone?  Probably not.  If you&#8217;re pounding out 100 miles a day you&#8217;re not going to have enough time to fish.  If you&#8217;re a gram counter and find a few recreational pounds too heavy, you probably won&#8217;t be into it either.  But, if you&#8217;re like us and like to explore, take your time and aren&#8217;t in the rush to get anywhere &#8211; you&#8217;ll love it!</p>
