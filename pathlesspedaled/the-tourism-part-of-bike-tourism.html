<h1>The Tourism Part of Bike Tourism</h1>
<p>Over the past two years, as we&#8217;ve worked on bike tourism initiatives with Travel Oregon, we&#8217;ve been able to ground-truth our ideas about bicycle travel as an economic development vehicle.  We&#8217;ve also taken every opportunity to learn more about the tourism world &#8211; and how to talk to tourism professionals about bikes.</p>
<p>At the end of April, we had the great fortune to immerse ourselves a little deeper into Oregon tourism.  First up was the Rural Tourism Gathering, which was a sort of 2.0 program for community members who had previously participated in one of Travel Oregon&#8217;s award-winning Rural Tourism (or Bike Tourism) Studios.  A few days later, we attended the Oregon Governor&#8217;s Conference on Tourism.  In both instances, our main goal was simply to learn and absorb.</p>

<p><strong>What did we take away?</strong></p>
<p>First, and foremost, was the reminder that successful destination development is all about relationship-building: making those connections with the people in your community and neighboring communities, so that it&#8217;s a group effort.  In small towns and rural regions, this becomes even more important, because it creates a larger talent pool to draw from, and helps lift the entire region.</p>
<p>Which leads into the idea of &#8220;coopetition.&#8221;  By promoting the region rather than just your own small hamlet, you pool resources, and draw a larger number of visitors to spend a larger amount of time/money in the region.  Work together to bring folks to the region first, then distinguish yourself from other establishments.</p>

<p>We also learned about the way that tourism promotion is changing.  Whereas travel marketing has traditionally been confined to travel-specific publications and focused on selling flights and hotels, it is increasingly focused on lifestyle and the experiences someone can have related to that lifestyle.  In other words: &#8220;visitors want to travel to where their people are,&#8221; and it&#8217;s increasingly important to facilitate that connection.  Travel Oregon sees articles about the culture of Oregon mountain biking as potentially just as influential as articles about specific restaurants.</p>
<p>And, lastly, we were delighted to hear discussion of the importance of video.  In the opening morning remarks of the Governor&#8217;s Conference, we learned that 64% of visitors said their travel decisions were influenced by online video content.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for bike tourism?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of building and promoting bike tourism, we&#8217;re realizing more and more that the tourism aspect is just as important (if not more so) than the bicycling aspect &#8211; because simply offering good roads or trails does not secure a positive travel experience.  The most successful bike tourism initiatives are collaborative efforts between tourism, business owners, community members, and bike advocates.  Bike tourism is about the biking, but it&#8217;s also about being a tourist and having a positive travel experience.  Or, as Phil Carlson from TREO Ranch put it: &#8220;It&#8217;s just hospitality, the bicycle is the draw.&#8221;</p>
