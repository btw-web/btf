<h1>Bikes Not Bombs Presentation Wrap-Up</h1>
<p>We had a wonderful presentation at <a href="http://bikesnotbombs.org/">Bikes Not Bombs</a> world headquarters last night!  We managed to fill the room and use up every spare chair they had available.  It was wonderful to meet some readers who have been following us from the very beginning of our trip up to now.  It was also great that so many people that had attended had never been to Bikes Not Bombs before.  Here are some snaps from last night.</p>

Workstands and parts used by the youth programs.  BNB has been one of the most organized bicycle non-profits we&#8217;ve ever seen!</p>

Mohammed and Abdul, two youth educators, helped out with the raffle tickets for some awesome giveaways.</p>

It was a crowded house with about 65 attendees making for a great lively discussion.</p>

Some lucky attendees got some snazzy new Klean Kanteens for their bikes.</p>

We got to meet some of our longtime readers.  This is Laura with Bill, who made a two hour drive from Cape Cod to see us.  He&#8217;s about to embark on his own cross-country bicycle tour in a few months.</p>
<p>For us, the best part of the presentation is the one-on-one discussions afterwards.  It is really  humbling and heartwarming to hear from people who have been inspired by our journey to take their own.  I don&#8217;t think Laura and I had any inkling about what our simple bike ride would morph into after all these months.  You don&#8217;t get the sense you&#8217;re reaching as many people as you are when you&#8217;re writing a blog post at a campsite in the middle of nowhere.  </p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who attended last night or any of our other events and presentations.  If reading our site or attending one of our presentations has inspired to hit the road, we&#8217;d love to hear from you via <a href="mailto:pathlesspedaled@gmail.com">email</a> or in the comments!</p>
