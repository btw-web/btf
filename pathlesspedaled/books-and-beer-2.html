<h1>Books and Beer!</h1>
<p>In our effort to try to creatively get rid of our stuff without it just going in a dumpster, Laura and I hosted a Books and Beer party.  All our books on the shelves were fair game.  We even pulled out a box of CDs and a stack of DVDs for people to go over.</p>
<p>Our group of friends are pretty beer sophisticated.  I would even go so far as to call them beer snobs.  One of them use to be the head brewer at Gorky&#8217;s in downtown LA in the 80s.  A few are home brewers.  And all, which I attribute to an affection for hops, are readers.</p>
<p>Because we had sold almost all our glasses, we encouraged everyone to bring their own glass.  We had a few guest glasses for those that forgot, but most remembered.  I opened the large bottles one by one starting from light to dark beers.  I think the first beer we opened was a Bear Republic XP Pale Ale (a lot more oomph than your typical pale) and we ended the beer flight with Black Flag, a thick, coffee ground tasting stout that you sip and not chug.  Everyone got a little pour from each.  It was a beer tasting after all, not a frat party. </p>

<p>The discussion was good and lively, ranging from sharrows to marriage to most formative books to the finer points of cooking on a stick fire.</p>
<p>At the end, by our tally we sold about 115 books.  Which is a lot by any measure, but our bookshelves <em>still</em> look full.  We&#8217;re going to invite a few owners of local bookstores to return and take the rest.  What&#8217;s left from that will either go to the public library or Goodwill.</p>
<p>I recommend this to anyone that&#8217;s looking for a creative way to de-clutter and have some friends over!</p>
