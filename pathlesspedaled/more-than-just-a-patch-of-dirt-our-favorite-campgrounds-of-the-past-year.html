<h1>More Than Just a Patch of Dirt: Our Favorite Campgrounds of the Past Year</h1>
<p>As we inch closer to a full year of being on the road, we’re starting to look back at<br />
where we’ve been and what we’ve learned. We’ve covered a lot of ground, seen parts<br />
of the country that we didn’t know existed, and slept in every type of place imaginable.<br />
While we stayed in several spots that we wanted to forget before we’d even left, we also<br />
stumbled onto some truly beautiful and welcoming places that made our little tent feel<br />
like a resort. And since 80% or so of our lodging is in camping form, we’ve become<br />
amateur campground connosieurs. Read on for our favorite campgrounds over the past<br />
7500 miles.</p>
<p><strong>Top 5 Public Campgrounds</strong></p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.parks.wa.gov/parks/?selectedpark=Twanoh&#038;subject=all">Twanoh State Park – Hood Canal, Washington</a></p>
<p>We arrived at <a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/?p=563">Twanoh State Park</a> around noon, after only riding 12 or so miles. We<br />
stopped to have lunch and look out over the water. After a relaxing hour-long break,<br />
we decided it was just too amazing a location to pass up and we stayed the night.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2549/3840385047_895f4d9815.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3548/3840382489_eb7e624d03.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Twanoh State Park is part of the Cascade Marine Trail, meaning that it has campsites<br />
that are only available to people who arrive by human power. Given that we arrived by<br />
bicycle (and, thus, human power), we were able to camp in a small space right on the<br />
water’s edge in the day-use portion of the park. We were across the street from the main<br />
campground, meaning that there were no other campers nearby. At dusk, the rangers<br />
locked the gate, and the whole area on the water was left just for us. Waves lapping ten<br />
feet from the picnic table and tent, a rocky beach to explore when the tide is low, a sky<br />
full of stars at night – we felt like we had stumbled onto a little slice of heaven.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2431/3843677244_ddeb0fca12.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Twanoh is nestled amongst residences along the Hood Canal, meaning that it is relatively<br />
quiet (there is only traffic noise, but it’s relatively light). There are no services nearby,<br />
except for a few mini-marts within 10 miles in either direction (but these mini marts<br />
have locally-caught smoked salmon!). Showers are available in the park, and there is a<br />
small snackbar that’s open during the summer (we thoroughly enjoyed their fudge bars!).<br />
Camping is $14 per night (primitive).</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://azstateparks.com/Parks/PIPE/index.html">Picacho Peak State Park – Arizona</a></p>
<p>We pulled in to Picacho Peak State Park on our way south into Tucson. It is just off I-<br />
10, to the west, but it is set in the hills several hundred feet above the freeway, making<br />
it blissfully quiet and peaceful. When we first pulled in to the campground, we were<br />
stunned by how beautiful it is and how surprisingly tucked-away you feel.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4043/4254133193_1297f5eabc.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Picacho Peak is a small mountain in the middle of the desert, surrounded by cactus. It<br />
has a beautiful and fascinating history, and there are hiking trails that criss-cross the area,<br />
allowing you to climb up to stunning viewpoints. The campground, itself, is broken into<br />
electric and non-electric sites, meaning that most generator-running RVs are in one area,<br />
and tenters are able to separate themselves from the noise. We chose a spot up on the<br />
hillside, which gave us an amazing view of the valley below and the stars at night. The<br />
facilities at Picacho Peak are brand new, having been recently remodeled to be more<br />
sustainable. The visitor’s center is LEED certified, and the restrooms in the campground<br />
feel like a spa.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2749/4261561214_fa217bd064.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4061/4260807439_5263913390.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Picacho Peak was slated to be closed this spring, due to budgetary shortfalls. However,<br />
I’m happy to say that it looks like a group of concerned Arizonans banded together and<br />
saved the park, so it’s still open for others to enjoy! Camping is $15/night (non-electric),<br />
plus $3 entry fee (if not in automobile).</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=415">Elk Prairie Campground – Prairie Creek Redwoods, California</a></p>
<p>The route to Elk Prairie Campground is a small two-lane road that winds through thick<br />
redwood forest. If you’re coming from the North, you coast slowly downhill through the<br />
trees, tucked in a pocket of magical silence. After several miles, the forest opens up to a<br />
clearing – a prairie that is popular with the local elk herd, and a campground.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2633/3957226266_6ffa98a214.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Elk Prairie Campground is right along the very-popular Pacific Coast Bike Route, so<br />
it offers a spectacular hiker/biker camping area, set away from the RVs. It’s a bit of a<br />
walk to the restrooms, but you get front-row seats to the elk that meander through the<br />
prairie (and tussle with each other during Rut in the early fall). If you arrive on bike (or<br />
foot), expect to meet lots of other like-minded travelers. At night, the area is fantastically<br />
dark and quiet (unless the elk are in Rut, in which case you’ll hear them moan and knock<br />
antlers in the dark). Because the campgrouns is located near the ocean (although you<br />
forget because of the trees), fog drifts in and out of the area, making it feel even more<br />
ethereal.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2626/3956451871_494c6a622e.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2587/3957227904_26d77efd45.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Bear boxes are provided to stash your food and keep the critters away. Showers are<br />
available in the main part of the campground, and require quarters. Camping is $5 per<br />
night person (for hiker/biker).</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/enchanted_rock/">Enchanted Rock State Natural Area – Texas</a></p>
<p>When we left Austin and headed NW through Hill Country, everyone told us that we<br />
simply had to go to Enchanted Rock State Park. Fine, fine, we said, and plotted our<br />
course through the state park. When we got there, we were so charmed that we ended up<br />
staying two nights, just to have more time to explore and enjoy.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4541505367_28601eac74.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4535056104_7d024100c2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Enchanted Rock State Park is set at the foot of Enchanted Rock, a single and enormous<br />
rock that has been a magical and sacred spot for many. Camping is located at the base<br />
of the rocky cliffs or in a grassy field (we recommend the ones by the rocks). Although<br />
it’s not a long trek, each site is walk-in only (there are no RV hookups), making them feel<br />
particularly secluded and private. Some sites have covered tables, which is great in times<br />
of sun or rain. Water is located in the parking area, so bring some sort of container to<br />
carry it back to your site. Firewood and showers are available, and WiFi can be accessed<br />
at the ranger station.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2790/4541505511_3147560691_o.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>While you’re there, make sure you carve out time to hike to the top of Enchanted Rock.<br />
It’s a short, steep walk up the face of the rock, and the views from the top are incredible.<br />
If you visit during the spring, you’ll also be treated to beautiful wildflower blooms.<br />
Camping is $15 per night (non-peak times) and $17 per night (peak times), with $6 per<br />
person per day entry fee.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.nps.gov/bibe/planyourvisit/basin_campground.htm">Chisos Basin Campground – Big Bend National Park, Texas</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/?p=1251">Chisos Basin</a> is located in the middle of a mountainous fortress. From the main road<br />
through Big Bend National Park, you climb 5 miles up a steep and winding road, before<br />
reaching the summit and heading1.5 miles down into the 5,400-feet-high valley. From<br />
the campground, you are surrounded on all sides by mountain peaks, making sunset a<br />
truly magical experience.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4015/4396873936_5470a44db2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>You have to work to get to Chisos Basin on a bike. You have to really want it. And<br />
when you tip over the edge and soar into the campground, it will literally take your breath<br />
away. This is one of the single most amazingly beautiful locations either of us has ever<br />
been.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2751/4400237796_18163ff7f6.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4399466967_a4147d3f25.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The campground is fairly small, and is predominantly full of people in tents, as many<br />
RVs cannot make the drive. Restrooms and running water are available. There are no<br />
showers, but we felt it was worth it to be dirty to see this place. A short half-mile hike up<br />
the hill takes you to the lodge, visitors center and small store, where you can get a motel<br />
room, eat in a restaurant, buy snacks, and learn about the area. Hikes are available in all<br />
direction. Camping is $8 per night.</p>
<p><strong>Top 5 Private Campgrounds</strong></p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.fallhollow.com/">Fall Hollow Campground – Hohenwald, Tennessee (off Natchez Trace Parkway)</a></p>
<p>Nearing the end of our Natchez Trace adventure, we stumbled onto Fall Hollow<br />
Campground. It was a hot afternoon and we were tired, so we very much enjoyed seeing<br />
a bicycle hanging from the ‘campground open’ sign. Bill and Kathy enthusiastically<br />
welcomed us, gave us some iced tea, and asked about our trip. We quickly became<br />
enamored of this place.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4063/4702654063_a78d71e210.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4063/4703290718_9be7c344ae.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Fall Hollow is a lovely campground. Nestled into the rolling green hills, with plenty<br />
of trees and a creek winding along the back of the property. It’s quiet, relaxing, clean,<br />
and friendly. Cyclists are definitely welcome here. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday<br />
nights, Fall Hollow also operates a restaurant, open for dinner. The food is delicious and<br />
well worth reconfiguring a trip to be sure to be there on one of those evenings. Showers<br />
are available, although a dip in the cold-water creek may be more refreshing on a hot<br />
afternoon.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4055/4703290578_b0dc730349.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Fall Hollow is extremely convenient if you’re cycling the Natchez Trace, and should be<br />
a destination for all road-weary travelers (cyclists, make sure you add your name to the<br />
map!). $5 per person per night.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://pleasurepointmarina.org/">Pleasure Point Marina – Lake Claiborne, Louisiana</a></p>
<p>Our stop at Pleasure Point Marina was complete coincidence and serendipity, as most<br />
great things are. We met Russell (the owner) in the nearby town of Homer and he invited<br />
us down for the weekend, instead of simply stopping at the state park. As we pitched our<br />
tent just ten feet from the edge of the lake, we were thrilled by this change of plans.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4632319965_b68e3f82ed.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Pleasure Point is mainly an RV camp, but tenters are also welcome. There are very<br />
loose delineations between sites, so everyone is friendly with their neighbors, and we<br />
enjoyed chatting with the guy camped next to us. The campground is located at the<br />
end of a small point of land that juts out into Lake Claiborne. On a hot day, you can<br />
sit under the shade of the big trees and enjoy the cool breeze that blows across the lake.<br />
When it gets too hot, go inside the air-conditioned café for a cold drink. The café serves<br />
some of the best hamburgers around, and now you can get a beer or a margarita with<br />
it. We started dubbing Pleasure Point “summer camp for adults,” because it was such<br />
a beautiful and relaxing spot, and because the drinks at the bar were so very enticing.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3382/4632914930_7e7b8587f8.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4632915256_3e762dc621.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>3. <a href="http://lasruinashostel.com/">Las Ruinas Camping Hostel – Terlingua Ghost Town, Texas</a></p>
<p>When we rolled into the Terlingua-Study Butte area near Big Bend National Park, we<br />
assumed that we would just stay in a cheap motel for the night, assuming that there were<br />
no “official” camping options. Then we learned about Las Ruinas, and were delighted by<br />
this brand new and absolutely wonderful spot.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4400222310_71046e6fca.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4028/4392751992_05b16ebf5c.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Las Ruinas is a hostel, but they don’t offer beds for you to sleep in, you have to come<br />
prepared to camp. If you don’t have your own tent, you can stay in one of their soft-<br />
sided cabins, but there’s no furniture inside and they don’t provide sheets. If you do<br />
have your own tent, you can pitch it in a little corner of the desert landscape. Las<br />
Ruinas has WiFi, a shower and restrooms, an outdoor kitchen, and an old bus that<br />
has been converted into a living room/game room/movie room. One of the greatest<br />
assets of Las Ruinas is its location. It’s right in Terlingua Ghost Town, which is the<br />
old mining camp that was abandoned and is now being revitalized. A five-minute<br />
walk will take you to the Starlight Theatre for dinner. Then grab a beer and sit outside<br />
on the long porch and watch the sunset and listen to the locals tell some wild stories.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4028/4399452617_73434be06c.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/?p=1251">Big Bend region of Texas</a> should be on everyone’s list of must-visit locations. And<br />
when you come to Terlingua, stay here.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.rustysrvranch.com/home.htm">Rusty’s RV Ranch – Rodeo, New Mexico</a></p>
<p>When we headed east from Bisbee, Arizona, we knew that we wanted to stay as far<br />
south as possible, so we chose Hwy 80 and Hwy 9, and we prepared ourselves for a very<br />
empty length of road. Fortunately, at the junction of the two highways is the small town<br />
of Rodeo, New Mexico. And a few years back, Rusty opened her RV Ranch, enticing<br />
travelers to this beautifully empty desert scenery.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2797/4311474243_d88e4804c2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>We arrived late in the afternoon, tired from a long day of riding into a headwind,<br />
dreading the cold night ahead of us – and Rusty welcomed us with a smile. She opened<br />
her RV Ranch just a few years ago, on a small plot of desert land, in the foothills<br />
of the stunning Chiricahua Mountains. There is a small patch of grass behind the<br />
office where she puts folks in tents (amazingly, we weren’t the first folks she’d seen<br />
arrive on bicycles). The office also has WiFi and a restroom with a shower, so it’s a<br />
wonderfully convenient space to camp out. Because the temperatures were supposed<br />
to drop into the low 20s that night, Rusty moved her small portable heater into the<br />
bathroom, so that we could shower in a warm room and have a place to take the chill off.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2706/4312208424_9b5113e57b.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the morning, we had our coffee and breakfast in the office and chatted with Rusty<br />
and some other travelers. It was a wonderful gem of a place in the middle of nowhere.<br />
Camping $24.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.manchesterbeachkoa.com/">Manchester Beach KOA – Manchester Beach, California</a></p>
<p>Manchester Beach is along Hwy 1 on the Northern California coast. The area is beautiful<br />
and rugged. The state parks, however, leave a lot to be desired. When we rolled into<br />
Manchester Beach State Park, we discovered a bland campground with only pit toilets<br />
and no other facilities. While we waited for the camp hosts to return to change our $20<br />
bill, Russ rode back up the road a half mile to the KOA next door, to see if they had a<br />
market with cold drinks. He discovered a beautiful campground with a great hiker/biker<br />
deal.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2478/3985108142_c6b19b2fc0.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Manchester Beach KOA has to be the only KOA in the US that offers a hiker/<br />
biker discount and one of the few that doesn’t completely rip you off. For $9 per night<br />
per person, you have complete access to their wonderful facility – including a kitchen<br />
with gas grills, hot showers, laundry, a pool and a hot tub (which my sore muscles were<br />
extremely thankful for). More than all the above, because they offered a great hiker/biker<br />
deal, all the bike tourists that were camping in that stretch of coastline that night were<br />
set up at the KOA. We shared space with at least a half dozen other people and swapped<br />
stories into the evening.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3474/3985120204_ba9e25f8ff.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3535/3995700531_bb49fb355d.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The difference between the KOA and the state park was so stark that it was an<br />
instantaneous decision, and we felt it was well worth the extra few dollars. If you’re<br />
planning a trip down this stretch of road, we highly suggest the KOA over the state park.</p>
