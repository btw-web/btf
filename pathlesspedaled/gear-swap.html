<h1>Gear Swap!</h1>
<p>After about 7 months, our bikes have seen a lot of wear.  Some parts have made it, some have fallen apart.  We&#8217;re taking advantage of the fact that Austin is such a great bicycling town and has many great bike shops.</p>
<p><strong>New Wheels</strong><br />
We&#8217;ve replaced our wheels with new ones as a preventative measure after I managed to <a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/?p=809">wear through my rear wheel</a> in California&#8217;s gold country.  We brought our bikes to <a href="http://freewheelingbicycles.com/index.cfm">FreeWheeling</a> bikes, surrendered our wheels so they could reuse the hubs and rode off on loaner wheels.  I had my hubs (XT, Shimano Dynamo) relaced to some Sun Rhyno Lites.  Laura&#8217;s had hers relaced to a Mavic 319 in the rear and a Bontrager Maverick in the front (they didn&#8217;t have matching rims).</p>

<p><strong>New Cassette</strong><br />
After doing some riding up some steep climbs, we decided to get a little lower gearing.  Neither of our &#8220;big rings&#8221; have seen any action.  When you&#8217;re carrying heavy loads like we are, your money is better spent on low low gears.  We swapped out our cassettes with Shimano&#8217;s new 12-36 which the fine folks at <a href="http://www.peddlerbike.com/">The Peddler</a> ordered for us. They were supposedly made for 29er mountain bikes and supposedly you&#8217;re suppose to use a special hub with it, but I think that&#8217;s all marketing voodoo (we&#8217;ll tell you in a month or so if you do.)</p>

<p><strong>Other Parts</strong></p>
<p>We both replaced the housing and cables on our bikes which has probably made the most noticeable performance change.  We had ordered a new derailleur for Laura&#8217;s bike since it has had problems shifting into the granny.  However, Ron, the mechanic at The Peddler took a look at her bike and swapped out the front DR housing and it worked like new (we returned the derailleur)!</p>

<p>I swapped my brakes out from Tektro 720 cantilevers to Deore V-brakes.  I had never been really happy with the stopping performance with the canti&#8217;s.  They felt squishy and were really fidgety to adjust.  I originally used them because I didn&#8217;t think V&#8217;s would work with my wide fenders.  However, when I saw that they would work, I decided to swap them the first chance I could.  This required new brake levers that pulled enough cable to actuate the V&#8217;s.  I installed Tektro&#8217;s V-brake levers and they work great!  They have a much crisper feel than travel agents and (in my opinion) the Dia Compe V-brake levers.  So far, there is a SIGNIFICANT increase in braking.  I could never lock up my rear wheel unless I was in the drops with the canti&#8217;s but with the V&#8217;s I can do it from the top of the hoods.</p>

<p>Laura also bought a new multi-tool.  She was adjusting some bolts when her Topeak tool shattered like glass in her hand.  She replaced it with a Lezyne tool that has no plastic parts.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also swapped my rear tire for a Schwalbe Marathon Plus which is a little heavier to increase flat protection back there.  I&#8217;m still running a Schwalbe Marathon in the front since and hope this combo works well.</p>

<p>After 7 months of carrying a lot of weight, we&#8217;ve really stressed the parts on our bikes.  We&#8217;re probably a little abnormal in the amount of maintenance we have to do due to all the weight.  We figured we&#8217;d make use of all the great bike resources in Austin while we were in town. We&#8217;ll be pushing off in a few weeks from Austin, fully rested with smooth riding steeds.  We&#8217;re also swapping out our winter clothes (yay!) for some spring and summer clothes.  Let us know if you have any other specific gear questions!</p>
