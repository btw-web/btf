<p>Ever since our experience on the <a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/kiwi-episode-6/">Otago Rail Trail in New Zealand</a>, where we saw first hand how a trail can re-vitalize a rural region, we&#8217;ve been looking for a similar stories in the US.  A few weeks ago, we had a whirlwind trip traveling from Iowa to Ontario, Canada to San Diego.  We were in Iowa for a week and explored some of the numerous trails the state has to offer.  Unbeknownst to us, there is a pretty robust trail system in the state.  Many of them passing through small towns and are slowly being recognized as tourism attractions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/russroca/15972284822" title="PathLessPedaled-1040338 by Russ Roca, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7519/15972284822_b400401ba9_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt="PathLessPedaled-1040338"></a></p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant trail that everyone was talking about was the High Trestle Trail, so named because of an architecturally stunning bridge that spans the Des Moines River.  The bridge&#8217;s design pays homage to the mining in the area.  Looking straight down the trail, you get the visual illusion of looking down a mine shaft.  Since the opening of the bridge, it has become the darling of the region attracting visitors from all over the US.  It has become a new tradition to ride through the bridge, especially at night when it is illuminated.  More significantly, the 25 mile trail is beginning to make serious economic impact to the towns it traverses.  </p>
<p>We interviewed Scott Olson, co-owner of the <a href="http://www.flattirelounge.com/">Flat Tire Lounge</a>, that literally sits right next to the trail in the town of Madrid, Iowa (pronounced &#8220;MAD-rid&#8221;).  It was fascinating to hear how their sleepy town was being rediscovered because of the trail and particularly about the new businesses that were opening in town because of the trail.</p>
