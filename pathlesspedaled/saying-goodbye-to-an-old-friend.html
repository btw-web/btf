<p>I just sold my Trek 520 tonight to someone on Craigslist.  It has been laying around the apartment sad and unused, a shade of a shade of its former glory.  I remember when I first bought the bike in 2006.  I had just left my job at a law firm.  I was making the &#8220;big step&#8221; from a mouse pusher to a photographer, into the great unknown.  I needed a bike to carry all my photography gear.  That&#8217;s when I bought an Xtracycle and my identity as <a href="http://russroca.blogspot.com">Eco-Friendly Bicycling Photographer</a> was born.</p>

<p>At around the same time, I stumbled upon a book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Miles-Nowhere-Round-Bicycle-Adventure/dp/0898861098">Miles From Nowhere</a> on the dusty shelves of Acres of Books (a second hand bookstore in Long Beach that is no longer).  It was about a husband and wife that traveled the world by bicycle and it lit my imagination on fire.  </p>

<p>I took the Trek 520 on my first proper bicycle tour in Oregon.  It was heavy and I overpacked it, but it began my love affair with bicycle touring and renewed my sense of adventure.  Since then I&#8217;ve ridden it down the coast of California, up and over the Santa Ynez mountains and thousands of miles just commuting in town.</p>

<p>Tonight, I say goodbye.  It&#8217;s going to a good home.  A PHD student at UCLA that is interested in touring.  When I asked him how he had heard of touring, he said he saw a picture of a bike somewhere with all these bags and he was just amazed that people did that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I remember that was my first reaction when I first saw a touring bike on a road trip (of the car variety) to Vancouver.  I saw these cyclists with panniers and a BOB trailer struggling up a hill in the Redwoods area of California.  I was struck with complete awe and I wished that one day I could do something like that.</p>
<p>The bike now belongs to Luan.  I hope it serves him well.</p>
