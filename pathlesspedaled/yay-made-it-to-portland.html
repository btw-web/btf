<h1>Yay! Made it to Portland!</h1>

<p>After a beautiful and relaxing train ride we arrive in Portland, land of bikes, beer, books, bridges, beans and alliteration : )  We&#8217;ve visited Portland several times during the last few years and have fallen in love with it.  The bike scene here is spectacular and makes a logical launch point for any bike adventure.</p>
<p><a href='http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/russroca/gMeGatCdi32PwgoNadvjaeNnmyjTvmM5XPbe5ELdHaoAWRN1fyG8Wf9dEzgD/photo.jpg'><img loading="lazy" src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/russroca/9G1pMZXeMBXVzjSpfLl6z8bVU363ogtJMZXSD6i9etXPvNOfy3y6W3G6AZtE/photo.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="486"/></a> </p>
<p>At Union Station, we have to carry our panniers and bags to the luggage pick up area.  It is not a graceful maneuver.  I have my handlebar bag and duffle criss-crossing my chest and am holding a pair of panniers on either hand.  We have to stop every 100 feet and put them down.</p>
<p><a href='http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/russroca/XdLizSGmJ1kkxDdvNXmabRxfe2Fr8ZZNmMdTDHMAkzSGxf8M6IoGQipTXszF/photo_2.jpg'><img loading="lazy" src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/russroca/mFaXmYzKlpj4RyE0wznFofoKP0lsI5x0eogjAamOPRR7cuCJwjXy2HiA0B6l/photo_2.jpg.scaled.500.jpg" width="500" height="486"/></a></p>
<p>When we get to the luggage area there area we see a few other people re-assembling their bikes.  After we get all are things together we push off!  Finally we&#8217;re pedaling.  As nice as the train trip was, it was good to be on a bike.  </p>
<p>Only a few miles on the road and we run into Brian on his commute home, &#8220;Are you guys PathLessPedaled?&#8221;  How cool is that?!  We chat for a bit and he tells us about how he and his wife did a 6 month trip on bicycle crossing the country.  We split off and start to head off to where we are staying for the next few days.</p>
<p>We stop for a bit at A Better Cycle, a small bike shop cooperative.  Outside the shop, someone has a home made Long John bicycle (or from CAT?).  Of course, I geek out and take a few snaps.  While we&#8217;re there, I get a message from DonnaB a reader of the page telling me that she has a pair of locks we can borrow for the next few days.  I give her a call and as luck would have it, she only lives a few blocks from A Better Cycle!</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3519/3777213574_dabc5267df.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>She comes by a few minutes later with the locks and we chat for a bit.  We head back to her place where she also lends us a bike map of the city.  Donna fills us in on all the utility centered bike shops in town, some bikey events this weekend and some good places to eat.</p>
<p>We then push off to where we&#8217;re staying and meet our gracious hosts for the next few days.</p>
<p>It has been a whirlwind experience the last few weeks to get to this point and it&#8217;s nice to be here.  Thank you everyone for all your support and kind words during the very beginning of our journey!</p>
