<h1>Who Moved My Cheese?</h1>
<p>How do you write about the transition from adventurous traveler to urban dweller?  What do you say about the bouts of sadness and depression, the feeling of a loss of purpose, the way time just disappears without any sense of productivity?  How do you describe the intense missing of the way you used to feel so alive on a daily basis?  </p>
<p>After tackling great heights and fears, we find ourselves flailing a bit.  The irony of our very-unstructured trip is that we had a definite set of daily routines (not to mention a great big umbrella of a goal that propelled us forward).  These days, as we effectively start over, routine is hard to find.  And we have bumbled around a lot, trying to reconcile this stationary chapter of our lives with our self-identification as travelers.  </p>
<p>I remember watching the TV show &#8220;China Beach&#8221; when I was younger.  Nothing stands out to me now about the series, except for the final episode when they all leave the war and go home.  I felt an immense sadness for the characters then, and now I feel like I kind of understand that experience.  What do you do next, after the end of something completely life-changing?  It has given me new respect for the ways in which Peace Corps volunteers come back and re-integrate (Lynn, if you&#8217;re reading, I&#8217;m sending long-distance hugs as you get re-acquainted with the US).  These kinds of big transitions are hard.</p>
<p>When we were nearing Boston, and coming to the end of our riding time, Russ would often lament the end of the trip.  I put on my optimist hat and tried to spin it as a much-needed break.  And, truthfully, I needed to rest, to sleep, to take some time away from the constant movement.  But you can&#8217;t really mourn the end of a part of your life experience and smile at the same time.  And so I feel like I&#8217;ve been in a bit of a daze for the past several weeks.  Time has passed, but I can&#8217;t really remember what I&#8217;ve done.  I&#8217;ve made and sent out orders, but I&#8217;d have to look through my records to know what all I did.  Like novocaine wearing off after a dentist visit, the sting of the end of the trip is hitting me hard now that I&#8217;m waking up from my fog.  </p>
<p>And fog is really the only way I can describe it.  Everything around you seems familiar and you know you should know how to interact with it all.  But the edges are dulled, because it&#8217;s hard to comprehend that this is who you are now. </p>
<p>In the excitement of leaving on a grand adventure, you never think about what it will be like at the end.  Which is probably good, because if you knew how sad and out-of-sorts you would feel, you might never experience the grand adventures that life has to offer.  Would I give up all that we&#8217;ve done and seen, so that I didn&#8217;t have to deal with these very difficult days and weeks?  No, not at all.  I would say that I wish I had been better prepared for this crash and burn feeling, but how do you prepare?  No, I think we just have to recognize that big life transitions are really difficult, and mourning the end doesn&#8217;t disrespect the experience.</p>
<p>And, then, somehow, we need to make sure to not entirely lose that part of ourselves that we found out on the road.  The other day, as I was riding down a street that I&#8217;ve ridden many times since we&#8217;ve been in town, I noticed a whole block that I hadn&#8217;t seen before.  A big rusted metal building, covered in graffiti, with a vacant lot next to it, entirely covered in weeds.  This is not the sort of place that just fades into the background.  Except that I had stopped seeing with my traveler&#8217;s eyes.  I disappeared into the sadness, instead of finding a way to remain a traveler-at-heart.  And maybe that&#8217;s the key&#8230; being gentle with yourself and looking at your new surroundings with the same eyes you had before the transition&#8230; until one day when you realize you&#8217;ve just magically adapted.</p>
<p><em>Note: We haven&#8217;t written anything about Portland, because it&#8217;s not fair to Portland to judge it from this strange place of fuzziness and sadness.  But we will, soon, we promise.</em> </p>
