<h1>Discovering Family</h1>
<p>It turns out that my great-uncle Herman rode a bicycle too.  &#8220;All over New Jersey,&#8221; I&#8217;m told.  </p>
<p>When my great-grandfather emigrated from Germany to start a new life in America, he literally jumped off his merchant marine ship in New York harbor and swam ashore.  </p>
<p>In many ways, this bicycle trip has been a journey of discovery.  For me, there has also been the discovery of family, of people with whom I share a mysterious history, of roots which partially explain why I am what I am.  </p>
<p>Meeting cousins doesn&#8217;t sound particularly dramatic, unless you know that this is entirely new to me.  I grew up in Oregon while most of my relatives lived on the east coast, so the idea of extended family is foreign to me.  A school project many years ago had me researching my family history and drawing a family tree &#8211; and, with only a few exceptions, this was the extent of my connection to relatives.  </p>
<p>Until we found ourselves on the east coast, and these names from a school project suddenly became actual people with whom I was drinking beers.</p>

<p>If you have never met relatives that you don&#8217;t know, trust me when I say that it is an odd and emotionally-charged experience.  It&#8217;s just like meeting anyone else that you don&#8217;t know, except that you feel like you <em>should</em> know them.  You search faces and words for some sense of connection, some feeling of relation, some understanding of what it&#8217;s like to be a part of a big family.  You try to not feel like you missed out on something as a kid, and try to not make one simple bbq mean the entire world.  It&#8217;s like stepping inside a huge jigsaw puzzle of stories that are hard to piece together.  A million questions flood to the surface, but feel strangely inappropriate to ask &#8211; I want to know what happened fifty years ago between my grandparents, but shouldn&#8217;t I already know this story?</p>
<p>We spend a few days with my cousin in New Jersey, sharing stories and photos.  I am so thrilled to make this connection, to get to know this woman, to start to feel like a part of a larger whole.  Russ laughs and says that he can tell we&#8217;re related because we both talk a lot and we seem to look at the world in the same way.  It&#8217;s strange to hear that you have mannerisms in common with someone you hardly know, and yet it&#8217;s also comforting beyond words.  </p>

<p>It turns out that there is mystery and drama in my family history, and some of it reads like an incredible novel.  I can&#8217;t help but wonder what to do with all of these stories that I am learning; I want to make sure they don&#8217;t get lost again.</p>
<p>There is a house in Princeton, New Jersey that my grandfather built, and in which he lived with my grandmother before being stationed in Turkey.  I never knew about this place or that they had been happy once, but I have heard the stories of my grandmother seeing Einstein walking around campus, as if he was just anyone else.  The pieces of the puzzle are slowly starting to make sense.</p>
<p>My great-grandparents are buried outside of New Brunswick, New Jersey, and we stumble into the cemetery on a gray day.  I have never met these people and I&#8217;m not sure what to feel when I stand at their grave.  All I know is what I have just learned, that they were the heads of the American side of this family, that they were migrant farm workers at one point.  </p>
<p>I have finally come to understand the lingo that designates someone a &#8220;first cousin, once-removed,&#8221; but I am still learning what it means to actually know such a person.  It&#8217;s a daunting task to learn all of this now, from scratch, instead of gently growing up with it all.  But I feel fortunate to be able to learn it at all, to look at this family tree I have recently been gifted and watch it come to life, to see traits in these people that I also find in myself, to become anchored in such a rich history.  </p>
