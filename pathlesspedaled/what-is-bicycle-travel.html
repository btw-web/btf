<p>Three years ago, almost to the day, we left our then-home of Long Beach, CA, on what would turn out to be a fateful bike trip to Joshua Tree.  By the time we had returned home, we knew that we would soon be selling everything we owned and leaving on an incredible adventure.  Never would we have dreamt that such a decision would lead us down this amazing path &#8211; or that it would open so many opportunities to show the inherent joys of bicycle travel.</p>

<em>A blast from the past.  Having a picnic on one of our early tours.<br />
</em><br />
Our time in New Zealand disappeared astoundingly fast, and now we are back in Southern California, figuring out our plans for the rest of this year.  While we are still wrapping our heads around everything that happened and all that we learned (particularly in terms of bike economics), we are more convinced than ever of the benefits of bicycle travel.  </p>
<p>In another couple weeks, we&#8217;ll be heading up to Portland, Oregon, which will be our home base this summer.  It may sound counter-intuitive, but we&#8217;ve decided to step back from the continuous movement of the past year(s), so that we can promote bicycle travel in new ways and to more people.  As we&#8217;ve been traveling, we&#8217;ve been making hundreds of mental notes about projects we want to work on that would help inspire other people to travel by bike and support bike travel.  The time to act on these ideas, we&#8217;ve realized, is now.</p>
<p>While we won&#8217;t be actively traveling, we&#8217;ll still be here on this site, sharing many of the stories that haven&#8217;t yet made it online.  We&#8217;ll also be taking our enthusiasm for bicycle travel off the website and to various events around the US.  A lot of the details are still in the works, but you can expect a number of opportunities to meet up and hear us speak.  </p>
<p>After 4,000 loaded touring miles on our Bromptons, we also want to share all that we&#8217;ve learned about adventure travel on these sturdy little bikes.  We&#8217;ve been hinting about this book for some time, but we&#8217;re committed to finishing it over the next short while.  (If there&#8217;s something you want to know, email us!)</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget the videos!  The Kiwi Chronicles will certainly not be the last series of short videos we make about bicycle travel.  We had an incredible experience filming and creating each of these videos, and we&#8217;re looking forward to taking the camera out on a variety of shorter-length trips to show the accessibility of bicycle travel.</p>
<p>But before we get too far ahead of ourselves, we&#8217;ve taken some time to think about why bicycle travel is such an incredible way of exploring a place and why someone should consider it.  What is bicycle travel?  Watch and see.</p>
