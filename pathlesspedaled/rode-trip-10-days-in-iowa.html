<h1>Rode Trip: 10 Days in Iowa</h1>
<p><em>A few weeks ago, we spent 10 days in Iowa. Our goal: to explore three diverse parts of the state and find great places to ride. </em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/RodetripIowa.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" size-full wp-image-6163 aligncenter" src="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/RodetripIowa.jpg" alt="RodetripIowa" width="608" height="606" srcset="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/RodetripIowa.jpg 608w, https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/RodetripIowa-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/RodetripIowa-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/RodetripIowa-200x200.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" /></a></p>
<p>The air is thick and sticky when we arrive in Des Moines, an appropriate welcome to the Mid West. It’s hot and humid on the patio of <a href="http://elbaitshop.com">El Bait Shop</a> also, but it’s worth it to sample the bike-friendly bar’s impressive beer list (along with some of their famous wings).</p>
<p>In the morning, we pick up a pair of bikes from <a href="http://kylesbikes.com">Kyle’s Bikes</a> in Ankeny. We had hoped to avoid the headache of flying our own bikes &#8211; and, although they don’t officially rent bikes, Kyle graciously set us up with a couple loaners for the whole trip (thank you Kyle, and Bob!).</p>
<p>Then we’re off to the SW corner of the state.</p>
<p><strong>The Wabash Trace</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://wabashtrace.org">The Wabash Trace</a> is a <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/routes/8627737">63-mile rail trail</a> that would make a perfect easy bike tour from the Council Bluffs &#8211; Omaha metro area. The surface is crushed limestone, and it’s lined with a thick canopy of Elm and Walnut trees. The whole length of the trail is a nature preserve, and there are birds everywhere (and squirrels and bunnies and deer). It’s quiet and peaceful as it winds through the small communities that grew up with the original railroad.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/550/18742388439_c2e424f2cb.jpg" alt="P1080823" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>The natural surroundings of the Wabash Trace.</em></p>
<p>We’ve arranged to stay in a few of the communities as we wind our way down the trail. In Malvern, we “check in” at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Project-Art-Church/167785496675889">Project Art Church</a>. A few years ago, Zack moved back to Malvern after a decade in Arizona. He bought the old Presbyterian church, which had stood empty for a generation, and converted it to a studio/gallery space and apartment. Now, that same apartment is headed for a listing on AirBnB, and we’re lucky to be only the third visitor to stay.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3704/18742384859_36418a84e7.jpg" alt="P1080520" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>Zack, surrounded by some of his work, at the Project Art Church.</em></p>
<p>We visited Malvern for approximately 3 hours last fall, to talk with the trail group in the back room of the <a href="http://www.classicafe-catering.com">Classic Cafe</a>. We ate dinner beforehand, and the idea of returning for another meal was one of the things we were most excited about on this trip. We splurge on a pair of steak dinners, complete with baked potato and fresh veggies. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, it’s the best steak of the whole trip (and quite possibly one of the best ever).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/510/18931469721_56670a50ef.jpg" alt="P1080582" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>Yum.</em></p>
<p>Along the trail, we goof off at the old jail in Silver City, stop in to the Mineola Steakhouse (where the infamous Thursday Night Taco Ride ends), and ponder the meaning of all the train cars in the river (an old way of dealing with riverbank erosion). We meet up with some local trail advocates who ride a stretch of the trail with us and tell us all the fascinating history.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/290/18931470951_aedbd1535c.jpg" alt="P1080717" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>A small piece of history tucked along the Wabash Trace.</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3843/18306028474_47feb2e0ef.jpg" alt="P1090149" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>Trail champion, Becca, and her son, enjoying one of the many historic rail bridges.</em></p>
<p>In Imogene, the tiniest town along the trail, I’m told the current population is: “maybe 40?” But it somehow feels bigger than it is &#8211; maybe because <a href="http://imogenesemeraldisle.com">The Emerald Isle</a>, the local bar (and only business in town), is the de facto community hang-out spot, and it’s positively buzzing when we’re there. Dinner is great, but it’s really just an excuse to dig in to the pie. Twice a year, at spring planting and fall harvest, the infamous Pie Lady and her husband travel to Imogene to help at the family farm, and immense and delicious pies abound. It’s a story that couldn’t be any more ‘small town,’ and it’s exactly the memorable sort of experience that got us into bike touring in the first place.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/550/18306025364_f77f78d06c.jpg" alt="P1080907" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>Seriously, plan your trip around the pie.</em></p>
<p>The next day, we work our way down to Shenandoah, the biggest town along the Wabash Trace (except for Council Bluffs, which anchors the trail at the North end). In Shenandoah, we have three places to seek out: <a href="http://www.wabashwinecompany.com">Wabash Wine Company</a> (yes, Iowa makes wine &#8211; Wabash also makes excellent wood-fired pizzas), George Jay Drug (or, rather, the old fashioned soda fountain inside the pharmacy), and <a href="http://www.depotdeli.com">The Depot Deli</a> (an old railroad depot converted to a restaurant, that also houses a micro-brewery). The woman at the <a href="http://shenandoahinnandsuites.com">Shenandoah Inn</a>, when I ask about our bikes at check-in, laughs, not skipping a single beat: “of course you can bring them in!” she says, telling me that they see a lot of folks coming in off the trail.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/503/18740903230_c3fdfa33cd.jpg" alt="P1090998" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>The Depot Deli and its incredible collection of memorabilia.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grinnell </strong></p>
<p>Our next destination is Grinnell, a small college town about an hour NE of Des Moines. For the past several years, Grinnell has hosted <a href="http://transiowa.blogspot.com">TransIowa</a>, which has helped put the town on the map for gravel riding. After a teaser ride last fall, we’re excited to really explore some of the roads that the harder-core-than-us TI riders traverse (we&#8217;re also excited that we’ll have much, much better weather).</p>
<p>Our lodging is one of the impeccably designed and decorated <a href="http://secure.dwebware.com/wheights/mainstreetlofts/">lofts downtown</a>. Since most of Grinnell’s hotels are on the edge of town, we feel fortunate to simply stumble downstairs and into one of several great restaurants. And we take full advantage, sampling almost all of the local eateries, including the wine bar. The food options in town are surprisingly cosmopolitan for this little town surrounded by farmland. (Our favorites: La Cabana for filling Mexican lunches, and <a href="http://www.theprairiecanary.com">Prairie Canary</a> for fresh, locally-grown dinners.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/286/18306135894_8b6f57d9c9.jpg" alt="P1100127" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>Solera wine bar welcomes with a cozy interior and a delicious collection of wine and beer.</em></p>
<p>Our first morning in town, we meet up with two local gravel riding aficionados, who have offered to take us out on an iconic <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/ambassador_routes/397-grinnell-gravel-lake-loop">Grinnell gravel loop</a>. Instantly, the roads surprise us, as they roll straight up and over some pretty intense hills. This is not the flat land that we blindly assumed characterizes the whole Mid-West, nor is it the kind of long-and-slow climbing that we’re used to in the West. These are short punchy climbs that suck all the wind out of your lungs and legs, before giving you a rip-roaring descent down the other side.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/394/18931589881_74693ce1cb.jpg" alt="P1100392" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>Gravel and farmland in Grinnell.</em></p>

<em>Lots of challenging-yet-picturesque hills.</em></p>
<p>A few miles out of town, we pass the barn that marks the end of TransIowa. We pass beautifully-quintessential farmhouses, perched on ridge-lines, overlooking miles and miles of corn and soybeans. We pass Rock Creek Lake and several small streams. And we roll back into town ready for a nap.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, we get into a rhythm of riding early in the morning, hiding inside while the sun rages, then heading out again in the late afternoon. We learn that the rides to the West of town are hillier than the rides to the East. We learn that B roads are absolutely phenomenal, provided that they are dry, dry, dry (these roads will swallow you whole after a rain). We learn that you can ride in a straight line for seven miles, and gain 500 feet of elevation. We learn that you can turn a corner and disappear into a landscape belonging to rural Europe.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3879/18742510969_8972da23f6.jpg" alt="P1100973" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>Just about perfect.</em></p>
<p><strong>Decorah</strong></p>
<p>Our final destination is Decorah, nestled in the NE corner of the state. Here, there’s no mistaking the landscape as flat. Decorah sits at the lower edge of the Driftless Region, an area marked by deeply-carved river valleys and limestone bluffs. As a result, surrounding farms are smaller, because it’s hard to plant thousands of acres of corn across the steep landscape.</p>
<p>We check in to the <a href="http://www.hotelwinn.com">Hotel Winneshiek</a>, a beautifully-renovated historic hotel in downtown. Again, we are within easy walking distance of great restaurants and shops. Decorah has a thriving Main Street district, complete with a food co-op and outdoor store. Again, we’re determined to sample a little bit of everything. (Our favorites: <a href="http://www.oldarmorybbq.com">Old Armory BBQ</a> plus a beer at The Courtyard &amp; Cellar’s neighboring beer garden, and the seasonal bistro options at La Rana.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3901/18928798365_6ce1b54ffc.jpg" alt="P1120442" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>Bike-friendly Hotel Winneshiek.</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/309/18928794855_469d80183a.jpg" alt="P1120347" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>Warm interior and delicious food at La Rana.</em></p>
<p>We meet up with the three women who’ve offered to ride with us in Decorah, and we pick a route the heads NW to the small community of Bluffton. It’s a simple out-and-back route, following low-traffic paved roads. We climb out of one valley into another, taking in sweeping vistas as we momentarily follow a ridge-line. We pass some of the characteristic rocky bluffs, before paralleling the river into Bluffton and resting for a bit at one of the shaded campgrounds.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/351/18931656101_03361bbfe7.jpg" alt="P1110355" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>It turns out there&#8217;s great (paved) road riding in Iowa too.</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/428/18741114958_8582aa602f.jpg" alt="P1110827" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>Rocky cliffs and rolling hills.</em></p>
<p>The next day, we expand our radius a bit and piece together a <a href="http://ridewithgps.com/routes/8615030">mixed-terrain route</a> that zig-zags down gravel farm roads and beside impressive rock outcroppings. We’re astounded at the changing terrain and topography &#8211; lush and green, then wide open farmland, with the occasion tiny community &#8211; and we’re astounded that this incredibly-remote-feeling countryside is only a few minutes from town.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/561/18741120178_faa635d953.jpg" alt="P1120087" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>There&#8217;s a reason they call this &#8216;Scenic River Road.&#8217;</em></p>
<p>Both afternoons, as the heat of the day fades, we head out on the <a href="http://www.troutruntrail.com">Trout Run Trail</a>, a phenomenal 12-mile loop that winds alongside fishing rivers, small farms, and a bald eagle nest. Russ throws a line out in a few places along the river, and reels in (and then tosses back) a dozen or so small trout.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/422/18741087710_bd1e649069.jpg" alt="P1120208" width="500" height="333" /><br />
<em>The switchbacks along the Trout Run Trail, as it cuts through farmland south of town.</em></p>

<em>If only all #bikefishing was this accessible!</em></p>
<p>Our 10 days in Iowa surprised us. As natives of the West Coast, we admit that Iowa never really registered as a travel destination &#8211; at least, not until we had an opportunity to spend some time in the state last fall. As we rambled across the state, we found signs of bike dotted throughout Iowa’s culture, just in a different way than you find in Portland &#8211; and we found ourselves wondering what other great rides are hiding behind the cornfields.</p>
<p><em>Our thanks to <a href="http://www.traveliowa.com">Travel Iowa</a> for their support. Our thanks also to the <a href="http://iowabicyclecoalition.org">Iowa Bicycle Coalition</a> and the dozens of savvy local cyclists who helped us narrow down the entire state to the three places above.</em></p>
