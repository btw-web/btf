<h1>Gear: The &#8220;Kitchen&#8221;</h1>
<p>When Laura and I went on our first self-supported tour down the coast of Oregon, we brought two stoves. We took her MSR Whisper Lite stove and I took my little Trangia alcohol stove.  During the trip, we used her MSR once and my Trangia for everything else.  Stoves are a contentious topic with bike tourists and backpackers.  Everyone will swear by the system they use.  Some people love their MSR&#8217;s, some their JetBoils, others use wood stoves and some just prefer raw uncooked food.</p>

<p>Laura and I are pretty solidly in the alcohol stove camp.  For one, they are relatively cheap.  Stoves can be <a href="http://www.rivbike.com/products/list/bike_camping#product=52-013">purchased </a>for $25-30.  They&#8217;re small.  They are virtually indestructible with no moving parts to break and fuel is fairly common &#8211; no need for special canisters since they use denatured alcohol there is a good chance any hardware store you walk into will have it (look in the paint thinner isle).  </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a little video that I made for <a href="http://www.epicureancyclist.com">Epicurean Cyclist</a> that shows one in use.  As you can see, it is absurdly easy!  Nothing to prime.  Just drop in a match or use a fire starter and throw some sparks in there!</p>

<p>As for the rest of the &#8220;kitchen,&#8221; I recently acquired a Tatonka cookset (virtually identical to the Trangia cookset but with a silver finish on the stove) from my friend Chris.  It included a stove, a very stable windscreen/base, some stainless steel pots and fry pan.  From that set, we tossed out the frying pan (since we&#8217;re bringing a paella pan) and one of the pots (we generally only use one pot when cooking).  We&#8217;re also bringing our aluminum kettle since it&#8217;s so convenient to have one piece of cookware dedicated just for heating up water.  The bulky but stable windscreen is a lot larger and heavier than the folding piece of heavy duty foil we&#8217;ve been using, but we figure it will be worth it since we&#8217;re planning to be cooking A LOT on the road.  </p>

<p>It also happens to support the paella pan just perfectly!</p>
<p>Another conscious change from the kitchen gear we&#8217;ve been using before is the use of stainless steel pots.  We have a set of MSR Aluminum pots that are a touch lighter but lately we&#8217;ve been concerned about the non-stick coating inside.  There&#8217;s mixed reports about how inert and safe it is to eat with over heavy use and long periods of time.  I suppose it&#8217;s a step backwards technology wise, but we&#8217;ll have no qualms about tossing the pot over an open flame or worrying about eating some errant non-stick coating!  We&#8217;d love to give some bare<a href="http://www.snowpeak.com/back/cookware/titanium.html"> titanium pots </a>a try but they&#8217;re a bit out of our budget.</p>
<p>Everything nests together and fits in a little bag that came with the Tatonka except for the paella pan which will just be packed in a front pannier.  That&#8217;s it for the kitchen cookware.  Things may change a little, but I think we&#8217;re pretty committed to using this set-up.  It&#8217;s just a matter of deciding who gets to carry it : )</p>
