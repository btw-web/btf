<h1>Pedal the rails in Eastern Oregon!</h1>
<p>A few months ago we took a little sojourn out to Eastern Oregon to capture some interesting bicycle tourism stories out there.  We visited with Kim and his wife Anita, who use to own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/themountainworksbicycles">Mountain Works</a> bike shop in La Grande, Oregon (their daughter and son-in-law run it now) and are now embarking on a new venture during their &#8220;retirement.&#8221; They are running one of the few pedal rail cars in the US!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/109208228?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="550" height="309" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>What started out as a whim has become a pretty serious business for them and came about through some rather fortuitous circumstances.  Unlike most rail in the US that is owned by a railroad company, the stretch of unused rail they are operating on is owned by the county. Through lots of meetings, conversations and perseverance they were able to get their pedal powered excursion machines up and running.  One of the toughest obstacles was finding insurance, since there are virtually no other operations like it in the US.  The insurance had lots of safety stipulations, so riders are required to wear a helmet and a seat belt.  </p>
<p>Safety accoutrements aside, the rail riders are a blast!  The current route goes from Joseph to Enterprise and back and takes about two hours depending on your pedaling speed.  There are plans to offer a longer day route in the future.  We crashed a large party that rented nearly all the cars for a family event.  Everyone we spoke to were extremely excited about it and were all having a great time.  The <a href="http://jbrailriders.com/">Joseph Branch Rail Riders </a>is seasonal and doesn&#8217;t operate during the winter, but start planning your Spring and Summer trips now!  </p>
