<h1>Finding a Happy Middle</h1>
<p>One of the things that I&#8217;ve been thinking about a lot these past few days, as it begins to truly and deeply settle in that we&#8217;re now living a very different lifestyle, is how disconnected I&#8217;m beginning to feel from the things that used to be a part of how I defined myself.  I used to spend hours online, trolling through <a href="http://www.etsy.com">Etsy</a>, making minor changes to my <a href="http://tangerinetreehouse.etsy.com">Etsy shop</a>, connecting with <a href="http://www.etsymetal.com">fellow metal artists</a>, reading blogs for inspiration and support.  As silly as it seems to draw some self-definition from this virtual world, they were all connections that made me feel like me.  And now that we&#8217;re on the road, and internet access is proving to be a bit spotty, and pulling out the computer is more of a hassle than we expected, these former connections are feeling more and more distant (and let&#8217;s not even get into the former offline connections with our Long Beach community) &#8211; and it&#8217;s throwing me for a bit of a loop.</p>
<p>Am I really more of a home-body than I thought I was?  Am I really cut out for this?  The doubts start creeping in really easily when you start feeling discouraged.  </p>
<p>But, I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s really that black-and-white.  I believe that there&#8217;s a happy middle ground somewhere, a happy gray area.  Hard to find and hard to define, but I think I&#8217;m starting to get hints about how to re-incorporate it into my day-to-day.  </p>
<p>We&#8217;re on Orcas Island again, hiding out from the rain and plotting our next direction.  And it gave me the time to create a pair of headbadges for our hosts here.  It was the first time that I&#8217;ve pulled out my portable studio and really worked on anything (and anyone out there who works at any sort of creative or hands-on livelihood will understand just how easy it is to not work and how much better you feel when you finally get back to it).  And, now I&#8217;m online, blogging, reading, working on my online shop.  It&#8217;s a small-but-vital connection to the me that&#8217;s been on hold for these past few weeks while we worked on figuring out the basics of how to &#8220;be&#8221; on the road for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>I have to believe that anyone who walks away from one lifestyle to try another, no matter how exciting the new endeavor, will feel a bit of nostalgia from time-to-time and grapple with a sort of homesickness.  But, I&#8217;d be willing to bet that most of us don&#8217;t own up to it.  I know it&#8217;s taken me a while to admit, even to myself, that I miss those things that I left behind (and that this feeling of being disconnected doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that I&#8217;m not simultaneously enjoying traveling and meeting new people).  So, I thought I&#8217;d own up to it here, in the spirit of full transparency, so that we don&#8217;t come across as overly-superhuman (even though, sometimes, we kinda are). </p>
