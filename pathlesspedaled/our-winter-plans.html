<h1>Our Winter Plans</h1>
<p>Neither of us can quite believe that winter is upon us, yet again.  We had so much hot and humid weather for so long &#8211; and, then, sometime in the last few weeks, summer disappeared and the air was suddenly crisp.  We&#8217;ve been enjoying fall in the northeast, with its technicolor autumn leaves, and now we&#8217;re trying to prepare ourselves for winter.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1369/5098506978_389669d81a.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This winter will be different from last winter.  Last year, we camped our way through two months of sub-freezing temperatures in the southwest, gung-ho to prove to ourselves that we could be &#8220;hard-core&#8221; travelers.  This year, we&#8217;re headed to Portland, Oregon, to work and rest and plan the next leg of our cycling journey.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right&#8230; we&#8217;re planning to pause our travels for a couple months.  We&#8217;re trying to wrap our minds around this idea, that we won&#8217;t be moving continually and seeing new places regularly.  After nearly 15 months on the road, this is a very strange idea for us.  Yet, we&#8217;ve also started to recognize that we&#8217;re tired.  It turns out that long-term travel can be as exhausting as it is exciting.  So, we&#8217;re looking at this winter as a way to recharge and keep ourselves from accidentally burning out, while we decide where in the world we want to pedal next. </p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s next?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be using our time in Portland to work on a number of projects that we haven&#8217;t quite found the time to do while we travel.  A 2011 calendar is in the works, and we&#8217;ll be putting together a series of photo and story books (actual printed versions).  Russ will be editing hours of video footage, and I&#8217;ll be piecing together new jewelry.  We&#8217;ll also be planning our next adventure (and have already been kicking around a few ideas)&#8230; A year exploring Spain?  A ramble through SE Asia?  A fly-fishing bike adventure in Argentina?  Trade in our LHTs for Bromptons?  </p>
<p><strong>What about the blog?</strong></p>
<p>We will still update the blog and Facebook page, continuing to document this portion of our journey.  Many travel blogs end once a trip is over, never discussing the lessons learned and the strange transition that occurs between travel and &#8220;normal&#8221; life.  Just as we documented the process of getting rid of our stuff last summer, we think sharing the story of how to re-assimilate is just as interesting.  Not to mention that we have a multitude of stories rolling around in our heads that haven&#8217;t made it on this site yet.  And, since we&#8217;re planning to hit the road again, we&#8217;re certainly not done here!</p>
<p><strong>Want to hire us?</strong></p>
<p>Since our goal is to work while we take our winter break, we also want to let everyone know that we&#8217;ll be available for hire!  If you want some amazing photos and you&#8217;re in the Portland area, LA area, or easily accessible by public transit, <a href="mailto:russroca@gmail.com">contact Russ</a>.  If you&#8217;re looking for some one-of-a-kind jewelry or bicycle headbadges, <a href="mailto:tangerinetreehouse@gmail.com">contact Laura</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>Want some roommates?</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after our presentation in Boston, we&#8217;ll be hopping aboard Amtrak and taking it all the way to Portland.  We&#8217;re hoping to spend approximately four months in town, so we&#8217;re on the hunt for a place to live.  If you know anyone in search of temporary roommates, or someone who&#8217;s looking for a housesitter or to sublet their place for a few months, please<a href="mailto:pathlesspedaled@gmail.com"> let us know</a>.  We&#8217;re hoping to keep expenses to a minimum, so that we can save up quicker for our next adventure.  And we&#8217;re hoping to figure out these details in the next few days, so that we can start planning for our trip back to Oregon.</p>
<p>When we get past the oddity of living in one place for a couple months, we&#8217;re actually kind of excited to be in Portland this winter, and have plenty of time to explore the city and its cycling culture (and beer and arts cultures too!).  </p>
<p>Thanks everyone!</p>
