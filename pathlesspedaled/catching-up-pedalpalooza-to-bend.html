<h1>Catching up: Pedalpalooza to Bend</h1>
<p>When you&#8217;re recovering from an ankle injury and slowly expanding your cycling radius, Oregon in June is a pretty good place to &#8220;have to&#8221; hang out.  Over the last few weeks, we have moved beyond the frustration of the initial set-back, and we have taken advantage of this extra time to explore and sink in to the bikeyness.</p>
<p>In June, all of Portland&#8217;s bike community comes together for Pedalpalooza.  It&#8217;s a celebration of bike fun and, after hearing so much about it, we were thrilled to be able to participate.  We joined in the rambling madness of the Midnight Mystery Ride (a large late-night social ride to who-knows-where).  We cheered on the cargo bike race, bike parade, and criterium at the Cirque du Cycling.  We DIY-ed red felt beards in support of Portland&#8217;s red-haired citizens at the Ginger Ride.  We shared tea and a hill-climb with other folding bike enthusiasts.  We toured the Irish pubs and read passages from <em>Ulysses</em> on the Bloomsday Ride.  And, last but not least, I stripped down with 8,000 or so other cyclists for the World Naked Bike Ride.</p>

<p>In between Pedalpalooza events, we piled all of our gear (in its new configuration) onto the Bromptons for a short trip out to the coast.  We took <a href="http://http://www.tillamookbus.com/">the Wave bus</a> to Tillamook and rode north to Rockaway Beach.  In Rockaway Beach, we met Maureen and Jeff, owners of <a href="http://www.seahavenmotel.net">Sea Haven Motel &#038; Guest House</a>, and talked with them about the impact of cyclists on their business.  (Hundreds, if not thousands, of touring cyclists zip by every year, and they&#8217;re on a mission to bolster Rockaway Beach and entice these cyclists to stick around&#8230; stay tuned for a more in-depth video interview.)  We were thrilled to stay in their lovely property and use it as a base to explore Wheeler and Manzanita (to the north).  From Rockaway Beach, we headed south to Cape Lookout, our favorite campground along the Oregon coast.  All told, we rode 80 miles, up and over some hills, and my ankle passed with flying colors!</p>

<p>On Sunday, we finally bid our farewell to Portland and headed east to Bend.  After the coast trip and riding around Portland, we were both confident that my ankle had become strong enough to finally hit the road!  We decided to head out to Central Oregon to visit my brother for a few days and flip the proverbial coin to decide where to head next.  In Bend, we&#8217;ve ridden up to Pilot Butte for the sunset, and out to Tumalo Falls &#8211; two beautiful local rides with a lot of climbing.  </p>

<p>After five and a half weeks of resting and healing, we&#8217;ve finally given my ankle a (mostly) clean bill of health, and we&#8217;re happy to announce that <em>our delayed trip is finally getting started!</em>  From Bend, we&#8217;ll be heading east along the <a href="http://http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes/transamerica.cfm">TransAm Route</a> to Missoula, MT.  It&#8217;s a bit of a change from our initial plan, but we&#8217;re eager to log some miles, and we hear there are some small towns in Eastern Oregon that are making major changes to attract cyclists!  </p>
<p>Thanks to all of our incredible readers for your support over these past few weeks!  Updates from the road are coming soon!</p>
