<h1>A Beginner Again</h1>
<p>Yesterday, as I sat slumped under a black cloud, I realized that I needed to make a choice.  I could either continue to mope around and feel crummy about my inability to do what I had planned and hoped and expected.  Or I could move on, and re-frame how I think about this injury and what it means.  Because, I realized, the only truth in this whole experience is that my ankle is sprained; everything else is subjective and up to me.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2482/3579806727_723a7574ab.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>And then I had to chuckle, because I&#8217;m apparently not nearly as skilled at going-with-the-flow as I would like to believe!</p>
<p>Early in our last trip, we made the decision to not plan.  When you plan, you feel attached to it, sometimes chained to it, and you&#8217;re not as able to enjoy the spontaneous other opportunities that come along.  When we thought about heading back out on the road, we were really looking forward to getting back into that mindset.  Little did we realize that we would get exactly that wish, in a completely different way than we expected.  Which is truly ironic, because how can you plan to stop planning?</p>
<p>For the past week and a half, I&#8217;ve been lamenting the inability to stick with our plan.  Yesterday, I realized that I needed to give up the plan, to say &#8216;okay, life&#8217;s a fact,&#8217; and embrace this new situation.  But what does that mean?  And how do I actually get out from under these black clouds?</p>
<p>I talked with my Mom recently, and she pointed out something that I&#8217;ve missed until now&#8230; physically, I&#8217;m at a beginner&#8217;s level.  I can ride 10 miles, max.  I&#8217;m exhausted after just 3 miles.  And hills?  Forget it.  I just don&#8217;t have the strength right now.  The only path out of my ankle sprain is the same one that all beginners must travel&#8230; start small, do what I can, and slowly build up my strength.  </p>
<p>Which is where the shift in thinking comes in handy.  I can either be frustrated by my beginner-ness, or I can embrace it the way Buddhists do.  What if I accepted my current situation and set out to have fun anyway, in whatever way I&#8217;m able, without heaping any shame on myself for not doing more?  What would it look like to have an incredible adventure when I can only ride 5 or 10 miles?  </p>
<p>This is where my head is now, as I try to shake these dark clouds.  If it takes six weeks for my ankle to heal properly, I&#8217;ll give it six weeks.  I&#8217;ll stop forcing it to heal on my timeframe, and let it tell me when it&#8217;s ready for something bigger.  But I&#8217;m not going to just while away my time on the couch anymore.  The more I ponder this injury and what I <em>am</em> capable of doing, the more I realize that it&#8217;s still possible to explore this great big world of ours &#8211; I just have to do it 5 miles at a time.</p>
<p>What would an incredible adventure look like to you, if you could only ride 5 or 10 miles?</p>
