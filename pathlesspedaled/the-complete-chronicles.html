<h1>The Complete Chronicles</h1>
<p>When we first set out to do the Kiwi Chronicles it was because I wanted to record our journeys in a different way.  We have written and photographed our adventures since 2009 so video seemed like the next logical step.  Our years on the road has taught us that good storytelling on the road is harder than it looks.  Lots of factors are against you.  For starters, you&#8217;re riding your bike most of the day and when you pull into camp, firing up the laptop and editing photos, videos and writing copy are usually the last things you want to do.  Also, sometimes it can be challenging to find just the right person to tell the right story.  Some stories are great but are too large and nuanced for certain media, or they are interesting, but don&#8217;t add to the overall narrative arc and you have to cull it,  or sometimes the story you thought you wanted to tell changes beneath your feet.</p>

<p>In the end, I&#8217;m pretty proud of the video series we put together.  It took lots of hard work constantly setting up shots, talking into the camera when you don&#8217;t feel like it, searching for people to interview and editing editing editing.  Travel videos can easily be too solipsistic and I wanted the video to be more than just about us kvetching about hills and wind and I think we achieved that.    It was all on the job training, so to speak.   I had literally got a hold of the camera and audio gear about four days before we were to hop the plane.  In the middle of the trip I was teaching myself Final Cut Pro (episodes 1 and two were put together in iMovie and the rest in FCPX).   I like to think that as the series progresses, the videos get a little bit better each time.  There are massive amounts of footage, interviews and vignettes that were cut.  I&#8217;ll probably put together a few more shorts from it all.  </p>

In this video, we box up our Bromptons and head for the airport.  It&#8217;s a LONG plane trip.  We also get use to riding on the left side of the road. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xpo3AtBbJ0&#038;list=UUaThRBMEp21yRK4seqq3-Sw&#038;index=7&#038;feature=plcp">YouTube</a></p>

In this episode, we discover NZ&#8217;s most bike friendly town, Nelson! Not only is it great for biking, it also has great beer (reminds you of a few places like that in the states right?).  We talk to an artist turned bike tour operator and a local businessman who built a ferry to serve cyclists and pedestrians.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zao_MmbFifY">YouTube</a></p>

In this episode we learn the story behind the trail that started it all &#8211; the Central Otago Rail Trail. Its success in revitalizing a dying region in NZ, was what inspired the cycle the government push for a cycle trail network. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob8xn0RWfwg">YouTube</a></p>
