<p>We are currently in Christchurch with some down time as we wait for some repair parts.  It&#8217;s giving me time to work on some videos.  I&#8217;m starting to edit the next Kiwi Chronicle episode and lamented all this great Frocks on Bikes footage that probably will be cut from it.  So instead of just letting it gather digital dust, I had to cut a Kiwi Short.   I was feeling pretty down about cycling in New Zealand and Wellington in particular after the International Bike Incident.  This gave me some hope again.  Everyday cycling in NZ seems to be in its infancy and its groups like Frocks on Bikes that will hopefully help take bicycling from recreation and bring it back to the everyday.  In the video is Leah Murphy, one of the founders of Frocks on Bikes which has become a national movement of sorts.  Also present is Celia Wade-Brown, the mayor of Wellington.</p>

<p>As you can tell from the video is that it was pretty windy.  What you probably can&#8217;t tell is how absolutely terrifying the ferry ride was.  The seats in the ferry weren&#8217;t bolted down and actually started moving during the ride from all the tossing!  Everyone was pretty ecstatic to be back on shore and we all decided that riding a few hours into the headwind was more enjoyable than another ferry crossing.  What was suppose to be a short picnic ride, turned into some epic riding battling the winds back into Wellington.  At one point, three people in front of me and myself included were actually blown into traffic.  We got off and had to walk a 100 meters.  Surprisingly, everyone kept their spirits high and made it back.  Even Celia pedaled all the way back, proving to be a stout cyclist (now if she can only get some more bike lanes in Welly!).  Riding with the Frocks, renewed some faith that I had lost in cycling in NZ.  It still has a long way to go, but moments like this give me hope.</p>
