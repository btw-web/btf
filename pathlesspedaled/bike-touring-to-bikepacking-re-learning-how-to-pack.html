<h1>Bike Touring to Bikepacking: Re-Learning How to Pack</h1>
<p>From the moment I first threw a leg over my Warbird, I knew a gauntlet had been thrown down.  This bike would travel places with me.  But how would my gear?</p>

<em>Our first bike overnight without panniers to Cascade Locks.</em></p>
<p>As I stared at our bikes in advance of our <a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/2015/04/rode-trip-portland-to-cascade-locks-with-a-little-gravel-and-a-side-of-corned-beef-hash/">overnight to Cascade Locks</a> and as I dug around the pile of old bags at the back of the closet, I couldn’t help but think back to our very first bike tour, over eight years ago.  A lot has happened in between then and now, but I once again faced a packing conundrum that proved how much I still had to learn.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, I had no idea where to start.  I didn’t have any of the fancy gear, because I wasn’t yet sold on this <em>bike touring</em> thing.  So, I used what I had, and I overpacked a basket that hung so heavily from my handlebars that it scraped the paint off the headtube.  </p>
<p>We all have to start somewhere, but there would be no ill-fitting basket hanging on my Warbird.  Nor would there be a hairdryer, or any of the other excessive items I packed on that first trip.  But I needed to carry <em>some</em> things, and I once again faced the fact that I didn’t have any of the fancy gear &#8211; because, again, I wasn’t yet sold on this <em>bikepacking </em>thing.  </p>

<em>Packing with panniers is so simple and easy.</em></p>
<p>The truth is I like panniers.  They’re simple, they’re exceedingly functional, they locate the weight of your gear low to the ground.  In contrast, most bikepacking setups rely on many small bags, strapped all over the place with fat ugly velcro, located so high off the ground that they raise your center of gravity.</p>
<p>Panniers are egalitarian.  You can use them to buy groceries and you can use them to travel the world.  Those funny seat bags, though?  Where else do you use those? </p>
<p>Plus, I’ve become incredibly skilled at packing for a bike trip with panniers.  It’s such second-nature that I really don’t need to think about it, other than deciding what to cook for dinner.  </p>
<p>Put another way, though, maybe I’ve become <em>too</em> skilled at packing with panniers.  There’s no challenge anymore, just the chore of finding the things and dropping them inside just-so.  </p>
<p>I may hate the look of most bikepacking bags, but I have to admit that I like the challenge of completely re-thinking everything I know about packing for a bike trip.</p>

<em>Using what we got. The Arkel Randonneur rack and Tailrider bag was a good solution but not ideal for too much off-pavement riding.</em></p>
<p>And when I say re-think everything, I truly mean everything.  The systems that I’ve adopted for packing in panniers aren’t transferrable.  Neither is a lot of my gear.  For the first time, I have to care about ounces and excessive compressibility.  I love simplicity, but this is a whole other extreme.  And I really don’t want to cut my toothbrush in half.</p>

<em>Definitely planning more rides like this!</em></p>
<p>In the end, though, I accept this challenge for one reason: this bike is a blast to ride!</p>
<p>I just hope I can find a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mary+Poppins+Purse">Mary Poppins bag</a>, because it turns out that the trunk bag I have will only hold one incredibly minimal change of clothes if I want to make decent coffee in the morning.  </p>
