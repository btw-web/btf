<h1>Review: Da&#8217; Brim Rezzo Visor</h1>

<p>We like to march to the beat of our own drummer here on PathLessPedaled, so sometimes that leads us to trying things out that may go against conventional wisdom.  For example, riding in flat pedals, touring with a 16 inch wheel folding bike, and touring with a paella pan :).  It keeps things interesting. In the same vein, we’re going to make a bold statement here: <a href="http://shop.dabrim.com/Helmet-Visor-front-only-500100.htm">Da Brim&#8217;s Rezzo</a> visor is the most functional bike helmet visor ever.  I’m sure there are lots of roadies cringing at something so Fredtastic.  Deal with it : )<!--more--></p>

<p>Most bike helmets have more a symbolic visor than a functional one.  From an aesthetic POV they look nice and sporty, but from a functional POV they just don’t work.  Often they are too short to block the sun or shield you from rain. Their only real function is to fill your parts bin and make your mountain bike helmet look aggro. </p>
<p>The Rezzo visor aims to fix that&#8230;in a big way.  It is composed of two parts, an elastic band that is tightened around the perimeter of your helmet with a Velcro area in the forward facing half.  The second part is the visor which you can attach via the Velcro.  The detachable visors come in a variety of patterns and sizes (3, 3.5 and 4 inch models).  The folks at Da Brim sent us two pairs and visors in various sizes to try them out. </p>

<p>They would probably be great for blocking out the sun, but here during the winter in the PNW we’ve discovered another great use for them, blocking out the rain!  When on tour or commuting, I always dreaded the rain.  Not so much for the getting wet part (that sucks too), but usually after a few minutes the droplets of water would bead up on my glasses rending me essentially blind.  There have been more than a few times, when I’ve simply given up wiping them with my fingers and have ridden with them off.</p>

<p>The Rezzo, because the visor is so long and functional actually keeps the rain off my glasses so I can see.  Woohoo!  Although I’m not a big fan of getting soaked, atleast I know I’ll be able to see where I’m going. And YES, I have tried cycling caps of different varieties wool, cotton, synthetic with varying lengths of visors and NONE compare to the coverage of a Rezzo. </p>
<p>This leads neatly into the next question, how is it with the wind?  Since the weather has been so craptacular lately, we’ve been able to thoroughly test that out.  It does fine and really depends on the angle you have your Rezzo set up.  By tilting it slightly downward (it has infinite angle selection because of the velcro attachment), you can make it as aero as fits your riding style.  I’ve ridden it on wet days with gusts up to 30mph and have managed just fine.  Laura’s impressions are that that its stable in the wind.  There is a slight tug, but it’s not going to rip your head off.  This makes it ideal for rides where there is a lot of ascending and descending.</p>
<p>Although we haven’t had a chance to try the Rezzo out in full blown sun (we’re in the PNW afterall), we’re eager to take them with us on our upcoming California desert tour. We are fairly certain that they will provide great sun coverage!  Of the three sizes, I find myself using the 3 inch version the most and will use the 3.5 when it gets really icky out there.  Laura prefers the 3.5 inch version.  It’s really up to personal preference and how comfortable you feel with something sticking out of your helmet.<br />
<strong><br />
Conclusion: Highly Recommend 9/10</strong><br />
<a href="http://shop.dabrim.com/Helmet-Visor-front-only-500100.htm">The Rezzo</a> will look a little odd for many, but hey, so does riding a Brompton with a backpack!  This product is not for people with fragile self-esteems or those who take their bike wardrobe too seriously.  In terms of pure functionality, the Rezzo wins hands down.  The original sombrero style Da&#8217; Brim offered great coverage but could lead to some dodgy moments bombing quick steep passes.  The Rezzo rectifies that, offering good coverage from rain and sun with minimal wind tug.  If you want the coverage it brings but can&#8217;t quite stand the Fredtasticness, you can always remove it from your helmet with the velcro.  For us, the Rezzo will definitely become part of our touring must-haves.  </p>
