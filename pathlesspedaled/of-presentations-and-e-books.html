<h1>Of Presentations and E-Books</h1>
<p>When we started this trip, we really didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;mission&#8221; in mind.  We weren&#8217;t riding for a charity or a cause.  We wanted to ride because we wanted to explore the United States.  Over the course of the trip, however, we found that bicycle travel was a truly liberating experience that hardly anybody tried.  People ride their bikes fast down the road or on a trail in the mountains, but bicycle travel is not actively encouraged by the bike industry (with few exceptions).  </p>
<p>The more we traveled, the more we found that we had a unique opportunity to really inspire people to get on their bikes and explore.  This website and our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/The-Path-Less-Pedaled/94377691671">Facebook fan page</a> have been great tools to share our experience, but we wanted to go a step further, so we started doing presentations.  The presentations let us directly answer questions about bike touring and also provide a great way to meet up with our readers!</p>

<p>And yet, getting people excited about touring through the site and presentations isn&#8217;t always enough.  So we hatched this idea in <a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/2010/04/our-austin-s24o/">Austin</a> to actually take folks on an overnight trip with us, to REALLY show people how great bicycle travel can be.  And then we led a second one in <a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/2010/09/durham-s24o/">Durham</a> (thanks Jack!).  Everyone that has joined us on one of our overnight bike trips has had an &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moment, as in &#8220;Aha!  Why didn&#8217;t I do this before?&#8221; </p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t attend a presentation or join us on an S24O, but you have specific gear questions, <a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/ebook/"><strong>Panniers &#038; Peanut Butter</strong></a> is the next best thing.  We hope after you read it, you feel prepared and inspired to hit the road on your own!  </p>

Thanks to all of our wonderful readers and supporters who have already bought a copy!  Also, a big thanks to <a href="http://www.ecovelo.info/2010/09/20/panniers-peanut-butter/">EcoVelo</a>, <a href="http://letsgorideabike.com/blog/2010/09/russ-laura-in-print/">LetsGoRideABike</a>, <a href="http://www.bikecommuters.com/2010/09/29/panniers-peanut-butter/">BikeCommuters</a>, <a href="http://www.rocbike.com/2010/09/20/panniers-peanut-butter/">RocBike</a> and <a href="http://carfreeamerican.blogspot.com/2010/10/panniers-and-peanut-butter-book-review.html">CarFreeAmerican</a> for posting about the release.  </p>

<p><a href="http://carfreeamerican.blogspot.com/2010/10/panniers-and-peanut-butter-book-review.html">CarFreeAmerican</a> recently posted a review of the book.  Here&#8217;s an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Whether you are an arm chair adventurer, a S24O tourist(get the book to find out what this means), a multi day bicycle tourist, or an adventure cyclist, you will, I promise, love this book.</p>
<p>Laura and Russ take turns with the writing which gives this book the rich uniqueness of feeling like you are sitting across a picnic table from them.  They keep it simple, only sharing information about the equipment they are using, how it works for them, and what they like best.</p>
<p>They added some information I have never seen in other books about bicycle touring. A section on their Porch, fun. A surprisingly fascinating section on tying knots with a link to videos on how to tie knots, off beat and extremely helpful. The Office, answers the question what equipment is needed to document the tour while on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about bike touring and want to learn what has worked for us over the last 14 months, get a copy of <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?c=cart&#038;i=807670&#038;cl=133479&#038;ejc=2">Panniers &#038; Peanut Butter</a>.  It&#8217;s 75 pages, full of tips, reviews and photos (about 30 megabytes, so download it somewhere with a good signal). Of course, we&#8217;re also happy to answer any questions you have <a href="mailto:pathlesspedaled@gmail.com">via email</a> (as long as we&#8217;re not in the middle of nowhere).  </p>
<p>We have one more presentation in the works for Boston at the end of October (more details forthcoming).  After that, we&#8217;re going to take a few months in Portland (Oregon) to work and figure out where we&#8217;ll tour next!  (And, hopefully, release a few more books!)</p>
