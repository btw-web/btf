<p>To everyone who joined us for the Oregon Scenic Bikeway Video Release Party&#8230; <strong>THANK YOU!</strong>  We packed the house at Chris King HQ and celebrated not only the videos but the whole of the Scenic Bikeway program.  </p>
<p>For us, it was incredible to watch the videos on a big screen with a few hundred people, and be able to step back and appreciate all that we accomplished.  What a different experience from scrutinizing them on the computer screen in our apartment!  </p>
<p>Our hope for the event was to bring the Scenic Bikeways to Portland for an evening and spread the word about the great riding across the state.  Our guess is that 200-300 people joined us on Thursday evening, which hopefully means that 200-300 people are now ready to ride the routes and tell others.</p>
<p>One of the biggest highlights was that so many of the proponents traveled out for the event and shared stories and insights about what makes their routes so great.  We leaned heavily on these folks when we filmed each route, because we wanted to accurately capture the uniqueness of their area; so we were excited to have them at the event and introduce them to potential new visitors.</p>
<p>Our heartfelt THANK YOU goes out to each of these proponents, for working with us throughout the length of the project; to Travel Oregon, for jumping in to such an immense project with us; to Chris King, for hosting the event and providing delicious food; to Base Camp Brewing, for donating beer to the event; to all of the talent, for spending a few days filming with us and being oh-so-patient; and to each of the businesses that we worked with along the routes.  </p>
