<p>Thanks to everyone who pitched in their two cents and helped us figure out where and when to lead an overnight bike camping trip out of Austin.  We have settled upon all the details and hope that you will all be able to join us!</p>
<p><strong>When</strong>: Monday, April 12 &#8211; leaving at 7pm</p>
<p><strong>What</strong>: A self-supported bike ride to McKinney Falls State Park, followed by stories around a campfire!  Sleep out in this warm spring weather, then ride back in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong>: First, send us an email (<strong>pathlesspedaled</strong> at <strong>gmail</strong> dot <strong>com</strong>) to tell us that you&#8217;ll be joining us.  Then, meet us in the parking lot of Freewheeling Bicycles, next to the Good Bike Cafe (corner of 24th &#038; San Gabriel).  We will be there around 6pm, so look for us when you roll up.  The ride will leave at 7pm sharp, so please plan accordingly.  </p>
<p><strong>Bring</strong>: You, your bike, and your own gear.  Remember that we will be camping, so please come prepared with sleeping bag, pad, tent, or other preferred camping gear.  (If you still need a rack or panniers, remember that Freewheeling will continue to provide a discount on these items through this week.)</p>
<p><strong>Food</strong>: Because this is such a quick trip, we&#8217;ve decided that it makes the most sense for everyone to figure out and carry their own food.  Consider eating a meal before we leave (either before meeting us, or pick something up at Good Bike!), and packing only light snacks for evening and something for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: $5 entry fee into the state park + a portion of the tent site fees ($16 per site, hopefully split between 4 or more people)</p>
<p><strong>Fun</strong>: We hope to get to McKinney Falls by around 8:30pm, which will leave us plenty of time for a campfire and stories!  Feel free to bring a beverage of your choice, snacks, a musical instrument, etc.  </p>
<p><strong>Getting Back</strong>: Because this trip is during the work week, we want to make sure that folks feel they can leave as early as they need, in order to get to work or school on time.  We&#8217;re going to put together a cue sheet to help you get back, in case you&#8217;re unfamiliar with that part of town.  If you&#8217;d like to ride back with us, we&#8217;ll plan to roll out of camp around 10am.  </p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong>: If you have any questions about gear, route, timing, whether you&#8217;ll encounter a bear, or anything else, shoot us an email (<strong>pathlesspedaled</strong> at <strong>gmail</strong> dot <strong>com</strong>).  </p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong>: We need to know how many people to expect, so please please please tell us that you&#8217;ll be coming!</p>
