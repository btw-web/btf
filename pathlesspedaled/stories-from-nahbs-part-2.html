<p><strong>Thunderbird Energetica: A New Energy Bar on the Block, and it&#8217;s Awesome</strong></p>
<p>The evening before NAHBS officially started, the city was a-buzz, and so were the bloggers at the bike blogger meet-up.  Not only did we get to geek out with other cycling bloggers who were in town for the show, but the organizers had invited several local businesses to display and promote some of their goodies.  It was here that we met part of the team behind <a href="http://www.thunderbirdenergetica.com">Thunderbird Energetica</a> and tasted some incredible new energy bars.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thunderbird1.jpg" alt="thunderbird1" title="thunderbird1" width="432" height="289" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2530" srcset="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thunderbird1.jpg 432w, https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thunderbird1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></p>
<p>I (Laura) happen to be fairly obsessed with eating whole foods.  As we&#8217;ve traveled, we notice that we always feel better and have more energy for cycling when we eat real foods and limit our sugar intake.  In talking with Amy at this event, I realized that the Thunderbird team feels very much the same &#8211; and this is reflected in their bars.  </p>
<p>Taylor, Katie, and Amy are all cyclists and adventurers, and they started Thunderbird Energetica after tiring of the traditional energy bar offerings.  You may think you&#8217;ve heard this story before, but these three  have gourmet leanings and are committed to whole foods, sustainability, and community involvement.  In other words, their philosophy is right our alley!    </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thunderbird2.jpg" alt="thunderbird2" title="thunderbird2" width="321" height="429" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2532" srcset="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thunderbird2.jpg 321w, https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/thunderbird2-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px" /></p>
<p>At the blogger meet-up, they had samples of all three of their yummy flavors.  And we sampled them all as we chatted about food and bike touring (Amy was getting ready to leave town for a week-long bike trip in Arizona).  In case you&#8217;re not sold yet, each Thunderbird Energetica bar is made by hand in an Austin kitchen.  </p>
<p><strong>Momentum Magazine gets a Redesign!</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with <a href="http://momentumplanet.com/">Momentum Magazine</a>, we highly suggest you find a way to pick up a copy.  Based out of Vancouver, Canada, Momentum is an independent cycling lifestyle magazine for those of us who don&#8217;t want to read about the newer-faster-leaner, hooray-for-carbon stories that you typically find in larger cycling publications.  </p>
<p>We have long enjoyed and appreciated Momentum (they ran a feature story of Russ, the eco-friendly bicycling photographer, linked to Laura&#8217;s headbadges, and have been good friends to us as we&#8217;ve traveled).  So we were excited to actually meet Mia in person &#8211; and even more excited when we found out about the swank new plans for Momentum!</p>
<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5059/5477576268_9923be1387.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>In honor of Momentum&#8217;s 50th issue, they have completely redesigned the publication.  It has a sleek new look and will broaden its focus on cycling as a lifestyle.  Look for great new columns about cycling-related travel, fashion, art and more!  </p>
<p><img src="http://momentumplanet.com/downloads/3307/download/bitblt-400x513-c4564d735e301ea63a7f6d91f38e15acba3738b8/50MOM-Cover-FINAL-tw-400x513.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>One of the great things about Momentum is that you can pick up your copy for free.  They partner with bike shops, as well as bookstores and coffeeshops, to provide the magazine to interested patrons.  Of course, you can also get a subscription and have it mailed to your home just like any other magazine.  </p>
