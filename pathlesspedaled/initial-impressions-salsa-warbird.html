<h1>Initial Review: Salsa Warbird</h1>
<p>There is nothing quite like new bike day, is there?  The hand wringing anticipation as you wait for the call from the bike shop that your bike is ready to go home with you. The simultaneously familiar and strange feeling of throwing a leg over a new bike and pedaling it home for the first time. This weekend, we added two new bikes to the flock &#8211; Salsa Warbirds.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/russroca/16859764630" title="Salsa Warbird by Russ Roca, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8814/16859764630_2fcc9fa96c.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Salsa Warbird"></a><br />
<em>Warbird Tiagra in Orange and Army Green.</em></p>
<p>The Warbirds are Salsa&#8217;s dedicated gravel racer and for some readers will seem like an unlikely departure for us (it doesn&#8217;t even have fender mounts!).  But let me explain.  Over the years, our interests and style of riding has changed over time.  To paraphrase much wiser men/women than I: mutability is the only constant.  Many will remember that we started with traditional fully loaded touring rigs, segued into lighter multi-modal touring with Bromptons, and for the last 3 years have been doing shorter trips with less overall gear on our <a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/2012/12/salsa-vaya-1000-mile-review-or-our-thoughts-on-salsa-vaya-vs-surly-lht/">Vayas</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/russroca/16340912201" title="Stub Stewart: Gravel Getaway #BikeTourR12 by Russ Roca, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7561/16340912201_6be0bff7fc.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Stub Stewart: Gravel Getaway #BikeTourR12"></a><br />
<em>While not quite ultra light, we&#8217;ve learned to pare down quite a bit! Check out our <a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/2015/01/rode-trip-stub-stewart-gravel-getaway/">Gravel Getaway</a> story.</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also started doing more <a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/2012/11/ride-report-2012-verboort-populaire/">road rides</a> and venturing into <a href="https://www.pathlesspedaled.com/2015/03/rode-trip-dalles-mountain-50-ish-route/">gravel riding</a>.  Fatbiking and bikepacking have exploded onto the scene, but since we choose to be car free in Portland, getting out to where those bikes really come to their own means a lot of pavement riding or navigating a Rube Goldberg puzzle of light rail and regional buses.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/russroca/17046477681" title="Salsa Warbird by Russ Roca, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7612/17046477681_928cf8c4ea.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Salsa Warbird"></a></p>
<p>This is where the Warbirds come in.  They are a better fit with our preference for trips that originate from our doorstep.  We plan to experiment with a rackless softbag/bikepacking system on the Warbirds for mixed terrain, multi-day tours.  There are so many backroads to interesting destinations and classic mixed terrain routes from Portland that we haven&#8217;t really explored yet.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/russroca/16859769650" title="Salsa Warbird by Russ Roca, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8754/16859769650_53fee8c520.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Salsa Warbird"></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re also eying some gravel rides and events, for research purposes, of course :), to understand what this &#8220;new&#8221; kind of riding means in terms of bicycle tourism and rural communities. One of the rides we&#8217;re looking at in particular is put on by <a href="http://www.bicycleridesnw.org/2015/">Bicycle Rides Northwest</a>, which features <a href="http://www.bicycleridesnw.org/2015/2015-rides/gravel-adventure/">3 days of gravel</a> riding out of a basecamp along an awesome flyfishing river! Of course, we could use the Vaya for a lot of this, but they are our daily drivers and loaded tourers.  For more spirited gravel rides, we find ourselves constantly taking off the racks and then putting them on afterwards.  I&#8217;m a bit weary that we&#8217;ll strip out a bolt one of these days so it&#8217;s great to have a dedicated rackless go-fast bike. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/russroca/16342651685" title="Stub Stewart: Gravel Getaway #BikeTourR12 by Russ Roca, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8618/16342651685_883729b101.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Stub Stewart: Gravel Getaway #BikeTourR12"></a><br />
<em>Looking forward to more lightweight mixed terrain adventures.</em></p>

Initial Impressions:</strong><br />
Enough of the why and more of the how&#8217;s it ride?!  Just as a note, we&#8217;ve only put in a few short rides and are still dialing in the fit, so these are pretty early impressions.  We both have the Tiagra versions of the Warbird which come in a glossy orange and a more muted &#8220;army green.&#8221;  Orange is my favorite color and the orange on the new Warbird is sublime and reminiscent of the orange waterproof Field Notes notebooks.  The army green has a matte finish and evokes a more utilitarian version of Bianchi&#8217;s Celeste.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/russroca/17047308235" title="Salsa Warbird by Russ Roca, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8715/17047308235_21f5c4630e.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Salsa Warbird"></a><br />
<em>46-34 chainrings make for a sensible &#8220;road&#8221; double.</em></p>
<p>The bikes are outfitted with Tiagra throughout.  The rear cassette is 12-30, fine for unloaded riding, but we might look at options to put in a 12-34 in the future.  The crankset is a 46-34 cross crankset, which we actually quite like.  The 46 is a sensible size chainring size for the kind of riding we do and lets us stay in the &#8220;big ring&#8221; a lot longer.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/russroca/17021301266" title="Salsa Warbird by Russ Roca, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7672/17021301266_97f09053fa.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="Salsa Warbird"></a><br />
<em>The chainstays aren&#8217;t only pretty to look at.</em></p>
<p>The handlebars are Salsa Cowbells, which we love and are on our Vayas.  They have a very usable shallow drop and a bit of flair so they are pretty functional, even for cyclists that aren&#8217;t contortionists.  The Warbirds came stock with WTB Silverados which many people like, but which we found a bit narrow for our anatomies, so Laura installed a Charge Ladle and I put on a 143mm Toupe harvested from another bike.  As mentioned earlier, the Warbird has no eyelets for racks or fenders.  For some, this will be a deal breaker. We knew about this limitation and since we have fully fendered Vayas, if the weather really got that wet out we&#8217;d have other options.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/russroca/16861088869" title="Salsa Warbird by Russ Roca, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7608/16861088869_57333d4e6b.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Salsa Warbird"></a></p>
<p>For our first ride we took them out to Forest Park, Portland&#8217;s local mixed terrain playground.  The surface in Forest Park varies based on the amount of recent rain.  When it is dry, there are some head rattling stretches with fist sized rocks.  Just after a rain, you can get some muddy sections.  The day we went, it was somewhere in the middle.  Some of the rocky portions had been smoothed over with dirt and there were a few muddy patches but nothing too severe.  The main road through the park is also generally climbing anywhere from a 2-3% to some 7-8% grade.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/russroca/17046471611" title="Salsa Warbird by Russ Roca, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7698/17046471611_38c61284b5.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Salsa Warbird"></a></p>
<p>The first thing we noticed immediately was how the bike seemed to dull the rough surface.  That&#8217;s not to say that it magically made everything buttery smooth, but the bike was working to take the sting out of the ride. We plan to ride the route again with various tires to see how much is a function of the rubber (35mm Sammy Slicks) and how much is the function of the bike.  Another very noticeable difference from the Vaya was the Warbird&#8217;s willingness to climb.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/russroca/17021304826" title="Salsa Warbird by Russ Roca, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8724/17021304826_3670e6bb43.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="Salsa Warbird"></a><br />
<em>The Warbird may dampen the bumps but is still stiff enough for the climb.</em></p>
<p>The rear end of the bike felt a lot more taut and responsive to standing and seated efforts, due to the shorter and flattened chainstays.  While not as responsive a climber as a pure-bred carbon roadie, it definitely had more get up and go than our Vaya and All-City Space Horse.  The front end of the bike is mellow and predictable which is always welcome on bumpy road surfaces.  Most interestingly is how well the bike descends on dirt, the mild mannered front end lends a lot of confidence on mixed terrain descents.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/russroca/16864021029" title="Salsa Warbird by Russ Roca, on Flickr"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7617/16864021029_e27b8dce0f.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Salsa Warbird"></a><br />
<em>The stable front end makes for a remarkably confident descender in mixed terrain.</em></p>
<p>So far, in the short time we&#8217;ve ridden the Warbirds, the bikes are undeniably a blast to ride.  If the Vayas are about going the distance, the Warbirds are about going fast.  We&#8217;re looking forward to really dialing them in during the next few months and figuring out how to pack our gear without racks!  So stay tuned!</p>
