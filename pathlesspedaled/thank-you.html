<h1>Thank You!</h1>
<p>With our temporary set-back because of Laura&#8217;s ankle, we are enjoying the beautiful sunny spring weather that has appeared, suddenly, here in Portland.  Sure, it would be great to soar down the road on the Bromptons in this sunshine and warmth, but sitting outside and soaking up some much-needed Vitamin D takes a very close second.</p>
<p>As we make the most of this waiting period, we wanted to say <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to all of our amazing readers and supporters!  We are blown away by your kindness and generosity!</p>
<p>For starters, <strong>Thank You</strong> for all of the well wishes about my ankle!  Your support and stories and compassion have helped me keep my sanity and gently work on healing (which is coming along quite nicely, other than the not-being-fully-able-again part).</p>
<p>We also want to say <strong>Thank You</strong> to everyone who donated to our Big Adventures on Small Wheels fundraiser!  The last day of the fundraiser was our intended departure date, May 15, and we raised $6,126!  Thank You also to everyone who told friends, re-tweeted, posted on facebook, and generally made some noise!  Every penny raised will help us connect with advocates across the country and start some much-needed conversations about multi-modal travel. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re hearing from advocates nation-wide and collecting stories about your experiences with bikes and rail.  We&#8217;re watching trends and finding opportunities to bring people together.  And we&#8217;re excited to start making some great things happen!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also seeing reports that show the economic impact of cyclists and bike tourists.  We have long suspected that small communities could benefit, economically, from  cyclists, and we&#8217;re excited to see this idea gaining traction.  </p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be out on the road soon, so please send us your suggestions for people to contact and questions to ask.  Also, even though the official fundraiser has come to a close, if you&#8217;d like to support our travels and our goal to increase and improve multi-modal travel, please consider sending a donation through the yellow paypal button on the right or buying an ebook, poster, headbadge, etc.  </p>
<p>Thank You!</p>
