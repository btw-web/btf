<p>It seems like only a few weeks ago that we tumbled off the Amtrak train into Portland and were standing on the esplanade, watching every variety of bicycle whiz by, in awe and wonder at what was going to be our “home” for the next few months.  We still remember trying to take a self-portrait of us and the Steel Bridge behind us.  We were looking for someone in the crowd of bicycles to take the picture, when almost on cue, our friend Logan from <a href="http://www.rowdykittens.com">RowdyKittens</a> appeared out of nowhere.  Barely twenty minutes in town and we were met with a friendly and familiar face.</p>

<p>Our seven month stay in Portland has been pretty rough weather wise.  They are not kidding when they say it rains here.  As someone that more or less grew up in Southern California, this winter has literally been the coldest and wettest I’ve ever experienced.  </p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/5155072204_3d4c3c3f8e.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>However, we made the most of the rainy season, or the The Big Dark as some call it.  We did some rides with <a href="http://www.cyclewild.org">CycleWild</a>, a great local group that promotes bike camping.  Laura had a table at <a href="http://bikeportland.org/bikecraft">BikeCraft</a> and still has some <a href="http://bikemustache.blogspot.com/">Bike Mustaches</a> over at <a href="http://bikeasauruspdx.com/">Bikeasauraus</a>.  I was able to contribute some <a href="http://bikeportland.org/tag/pedal-people">multi-media stories</a> to BikePortland, a website that has greatly influenced me over the years.   I took part in a photo show with bike pundit <a href="http://ellyblue.net/">Elly Blue</a> and local bike photographer <a href="http://gritandglimmer.com/about/">Heidi Swift</a>.  I shot a lot of lifestyle imagery for the folks at <a href="http://www.kleenkanteen.com">Klean Kanteen</a>.  I got to go fishing for steelhead on the famous Deschutes river.  We sampled a fair amount of food carts and local beers.  I also became a bit of a coffee nerd, getting into <a href="http://www.brewmethods.com">brewing methods</a> and searching for the best cup of coffee in Portland (<a href="http://coava.myshopify.com/">Coava Coffee Roasters</a>).</p>

<p>Of all the things we did, the most fulfilling was making friends and finding a community.  We were fortunate enough to fall into a small group of people that we really enjoyed and spent time with them, doing silly things like riding up steep hills to make <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0T8X6oURCc">Frito Pie</a>.  The word friend gets tossed around so casually these days (and has even been transformed into a verb), but we’re distinctly aware of how special the word really is.  One of the joys of travel is meeting wonderful people everyday; one of its sorrows is parting ways with those kind souls.</p>

<p>Laura and I had dinner last night and talked a little about the next coming days, but I was distracted and a little melancholic.  The reality of moving again was sinking in.  I was trying to get myself excited about all the great things we would experience in the coming months, the wide open spaces of Montana, fishing, riding through a part of the country we had never been to.  Truth be told, at that moment I was too overcome with the sadness of leaving our friends here in Portland.  It was hard to do it in Long Beach two years ago and it hasn’t gotten any easier.  It is part of the unspoken cost of travel.</p>

<p>Tonight, we’re sleeping on sleeping pads in the living room.  The bikes are readied.  The bags are packed.   Tomorrow morning we cast off and become sailors once again.   We are different people this time, looking at open-ended travel with a different lens.  We are  a little less giddy perhaps, but far more thankful to have this chance again (we’re doing a once-in-a-life-time trip twice, after all!).  Thank you dear readers, old and new, for following us through strange and interesting times of our lives.  Thank you to all the people we met on our previous trip who showed us so much kindness.  Most of all, thank you to Portland and all the kind souls who graced us with their friendship.</p>
