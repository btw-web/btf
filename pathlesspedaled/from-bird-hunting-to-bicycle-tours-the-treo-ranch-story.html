<h1>From Bird Hunting to Bicycle Tours &#8211; The TREO Ranch Story</h1>
<p>For the last two years we&#8217;ve been following the fascinating story of TREO Ranches, a bird hunting lodge owned by Phil Carlson and his wife Cathy.  They had been looking for a way to create a second income during the hunting off-season to keep their staff employed and through a serious of fortuitous encounters, decided to cater to cyclists.  A few months ago, we finally got the chance to make a visit and interview him about his <a href="http://www.treobiketours.com/">TREO Bike Tours</a>.  </p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/109377616?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="550" height="309" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Phil is not your typical bicycle business entrepreneur (he freely admits to not riding a bicycle), but his ranch is situated in a veritable bicyclists playground in Eastern Oregon with hundreds of miles of empty paved and gravel roads.  While he doesn&#8217;t ride a bike himself, he sees the potential value in bicycle tourism.  Phil is not the sort of person to take half measures.  He has invested heavily into making the bicycling portion of his ranch a success, both with time and money.  He took the week long bicycle mechanic course at UBI, he was a common site at Sunday Parkways in Portland this year and he has purchased and outfitted a full service bus and trailer to run his bicycle tours.</p>
<p>Phil is also important in that he provides a rural voice that is supportive of bicycling. He can speak about the positives and potential problems with bicycle tourism.  He talked at length (though not included in the final edit) about how being bike-friendly is a two way street and that bicyclists have to be farm-friendly as well.   There are signs in his lodge instructing bicyclists to share the road and respect the property rights of the local farmers.  </p>
<p>We are pretty excited to share this video since we feel it provides a great rural perspective on bicycling that is lost in our current dialog.  Bicycling on the national level focuses primarily on the urban story, often forgetting that a lot of the country is rural. The problem with that is that if we can&#8217;t make the case for bicycling in rural America, we are disregarding and ignoring a lot of potential supporters.  Sit back and enjoy!</p>
