<h1>A little about gear&#8230;a little about storytelling&#8230;</h1>
<p>I was on assignment today doing work for a client that wanted a multimedia piece done.  I had to do a combination of still photography and audio recording, pretty similar to what we&#8217;re planning to do on the road.  When I got back, I started debating about what I would be bringing.</p>
<p><strong>Camera</strong><br />
During my last few tours I&#8217;ve been shooting with a <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canong10/">Canon G10</a>.  It works pretty well, but still not up to the quality of a good DSLR.  It&#8217;s strength however, is that I am more likely to pull it out.  Which means more pictures.  I&#8217;ll be getting a <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicdmclx3/">Lumix LX3</a> from Panasonic in a few weeks to test out.  Maybe that will impress me more.  Fingers crossed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to avoid carrying a DSLR, primarily because of weight and space, but might opt to if I don&#8217;t think the compacts will be up to snuff.</p>
<p><strong>Recording Equipment</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve been using a Sony PCM-50 for the last few multimedia stories I&#8217;ve posted on the site with a Rode NTG-2 shotgun mic.  Prior to this, I had a Zoom H2, which while small had really poor pre-amps that sort of killed the quality of the mic.  It&#8217;s onboard mics are great for actualities and environmental sounds, but weren&#8217;t directional enough to pick out a clean voice.</p>
<p>The downside of the Sony PCM-50 is primarily the size.  It&#8217;s pretty big, it fills up the palm of your hand and then some.  Then, there&#8217;s the issue of the shotgun mic which is about 10 inches long and rather fragile.  They may end up living in my handlebar bag.  Not quite sure yet.  I&#8217;ll have to see how often I need to access them.</p>
<p><strong>Computer</strong><br />
As of now, it looks like we&#8217;ll be bringing this very computer I&#8217;m writing on now.  It&#8217;s a 2007 15 inch MacBook.  A little bigger and heavier than I would prefer, but others have carried larger (and smaller, I suppose).  Ideally, I&#8217;d like to try to get either a powerful sub-notebook or a MacBook Air to economize on size and weight.  We&#8217;re hoping to get business sponsors to cover some costs or lend sample products for a sort of Ultimate Review as we use their gear on this trip.  Again, fingers crossed.</p>
<p><strong>Story Telling</strong><br />
To say I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://www.thislife.org">This American Life</a> is an understatement.  So it&#8217;s probably natural that I really look at the show to try to understand how to structure a story.  I&#8217;m not even going to flatter myself and pretend I&#8217;m even close, but it&#8217;s ok.  I know I&#8217;m going to put together a TON of bad stories before I get the hang of it.  It&#8217;s a lot like when I first got into photography, I took (and still take) a lot of bad pictures &#8212; but my editing has gotten better : )</p>
<p>I also have to work on my reading.  It&#8217;s a real unnatural process, I assure you, to point the mic in my face and read.  I get real self-conscious and fidgety.  I think I&#8217;m a much better editor.  My background as a lit major (hey my degree at work!), has given me a pretty good ear for a compelling narrative.</p>
<p>That said, there&#8217;s a lot to learn.  Thank goodness for Youtube.  Here are some videos of Ira Glass talking about structuring a story.  I&#8217;ll be honest, I feel a little derivative at this point.  But that&#8217;s how it was with photography.  I got into a real Magnum/Henri-Cartier Bresson kick and shot a lot of photos of <a href="http://paulturounetblog.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/henri-cartier-bresson04.jpg">people jumping over puddles</a> before I found my eye/style for a lack of a better term.</p>
