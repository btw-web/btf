<h1>Let&#8217;s Chat!</h1>
<p>One of our favorite parts from our last adventure was meeting readers and doing presentations.  On our travels we were able to speak to hundreds of people in person, from Long Beach, CA to Boston, MA, and many cities in between.  During our presentations, we told stories from our trip as well as gave practical touring gear advice from our first-hand experience.</p>

<p>Although we’re not actively traveling at the moment, we still want to help people get on the road. As many of you may know, reviews, articles and forums are helpful when learning about bike touring, but the process of navigating the variety of information can be time-consuming.  From our personal experience, trolling through online forums and reviews can be a daunting undertaking.  Sometimes, it’s just faster and easier to be able to TALK to a living breathing person!  Imagine that!</p>
<p>In that spirit, we’re trying out <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> to answer your touring questions, one-on-one, mano a mano, through the magic of the interwebs!  For a limited time, we’re going to try out an <strong><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?c=cart&#038;i=866379&#038;cl=133479&#038;ejc=2"> Enhanced version of Panniers &#038; Peanut Butter</a></strong>, that will include a 40-minute <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> video call, where you&#8217;re free to ask us all your touring questions.  In writing the e-book, we tried our best to cover everything that a beginning tourist might need to know, but we also recognize that some of you may have questions that we didn’t answer.  Now is your chance to ask those questions!</p>
<p>What would we talk about?  Anything you like &#8211; from more in-depth tips on route planning, roads we&#8217;ve ridden and places we&#8217;ve stayed, to knot-tying, documenting your trip, and even fly-fishing! </p>
<p>We’re doing a trial run over the next month and are going to offer the <strong><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?c=cart&#038;i=866379&#038;cl=133479&#038;ejc=2">Enhanced Panniers &#038; Peanut Butter</a></strong> at a discounted price (if this proves to be wildly successful, we&#8217;ll likely raise the rate a little, so get in now!).  For $35 you get our e-book, <strong>Panniers &#038; Peanut Butter</strong>, and a 40-minute video conference, where you can ask all the touring and travel-related questions you want!  <em>To get the most mileage out of the Enhanced version, we highly recommend reading the e-book first.</em>  During the video conference, we’ll be taking notes on what we talk about, and we will email them to you later that day, with additional links and resources.</p>
<p>To order, simply click the button below.  You&#8217;ll be redirected to a shopping cart where you can purchase the Enhanced Panniers &#038; Peanut Butter.  You&#8217;ll receive a download link to the e-book.  And we will be in touch about the video conference (if you have a date/time in mind that you&#8217;re hoping we can schedule for, feel free to <a href="mailto:pathlesspedaled@gmail.com">email us</a> and let us know).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?c=cart&#038;i=866379&#038;cl=133479&#038;ejc=2" target="ej_ejc" class="ec_ejc_thkbx" onClick="javascript:return EJEJC_lc(this);"><img src="http://www.e-junkie.com/ej/ej_add_to_cart.gif" border="0" alt="Add to Cart"/></a></p>
<p>We’re also opening the Skype video conference call to people who have already purchased <strong>Panniers &#038; Peanut Butter</strong>!  Just because you&#8217;ve already purchased the e-book doesn&#8217;t mean you should miss out on this opportunity.  As a thank you for purchasing the e-book early, we&#8217;re also offering a discount off the total package, meaning that you can get the video conference for only $10 (since you&#8217;ve already purchase the e-book, that&#8217;s a $5 total discount)!  We’re holding 10 slots for people that have already purchased <strong>Panniers &#038; Peanut Butter</strong>, so <a href="mailto:pathlesspedaled@gmail.com">email us today</a> and we can schedule our conference call.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to reach out to folks we may not have met on the road, and we&#8217;re looking forward to testing out this capability for future products and educational opportunities.  Jump on board now &#8211; not only will you get to ask all your unanswered questions, you&#8217;ll also help us navigate this technology and plan for other possible activities.</p>
