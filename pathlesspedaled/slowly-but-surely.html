<h1>Slowly but Surely</h1>
<p>My Brompton and I are stopped at an intersection.  The light turns green and I push down on the pedal with my right leg.  But the bike doesn&#8217;t respond, at least not the way it should.  To get any momentum, I have to slam down on the other pedal with my left leg.  Slowly, I get up to a roaring 7mph, telling myself to simply be content that I can pedal continuously at that speed without any pain. </p>

<p>That was a week ago.  Today, I&#8217;m up to a more respectable 11-12mph.  But I still have to rely heavily on my left leg to get moving from a stop.  It&#8217;s a weird experience to push down with all your might, only to have the pedal swing anemically underneath you.  My ankle is healing and limbering up again; my focus now is building strength back into those muscles and tendons.  Slowly, but surely, day by day, I&#8217;m putting myself through my version of physical therapy, and I&#8217;m regaining my ability to go for a ride on my bike. </p>
<p>For the last week, we have been in Corvallis, Oregon (my hometown), staying with my Mom.  It&#8217;s a city with a lot of cyclists and some of the widest bike lanes and best-planned, best-laid-out bike infrastructure that we&#8217;ve seen.  But it comes with its ironies.  The lack of obvious bike &#8220;culture&#8221; has made us wonder if the sorts of bike scenes we&#8217;ve found in Portland and Austin are actually born of strife.  Since bike lanes have been around for decades in Corvallis, cycling is simply a part of everyday life, not something to fight for.  There was no need for Critical Mass, so nothing galvanized cyclists into a group (in Portland, ex-Critical Mass cyclists formed Shift; in Austin, they formed Social Cycling ATX).  It&#8217;s an interesting theory, and makes us wonder what it&#8217;s really like as a cyclist in Denmark and Amsterdam.  </p>
<p>Tomorrow, we&#8217;re headed back up to Portland for a few days of Pedalpalooza madness.  Amtrak&#8217;s Cascades line has allowed us to travel back and forth without too much trouble, and has provided even more proof of the value of long-distance public transit.  On Monday, we&#8217;re headed to the coast on a short transit-supported trip, to continue exploring the link between cycle tourists and rural economic development.  We&#8217;ve made some interesting connections and look forward to sharing them with you all.  With any luck, the following week, five weeks after my injury, we&#8217;ll finally be able to head out on our big trip.</p>
