<h1>A Night On The Lam, bicycle touring in Florida</h1>

<p><a href="http://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1080292.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1305" title="Bike in Cube" src="http://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1080292-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a> I have been itching to get out for an overnighter for several weeks, so I decided to pack up and do it. However, instead of driving home after work and grabbing the bike and then heading out, I took my gear to work, so I could ride straight from my cube! There were several reasons for going this route:<br />
1 &#8211; It would give me more miles.<br />
2 &#8211; I could spend more time on my bike. <!--more--><br />
3 &#8211; Not that I care what you drive, but I wanted to show the poor saps stuck in their cars during rush hour traffic that there were other ways of getting around!<br />
4 &#8211; It added to my sense of adventure, riding from a very congested urban environment to a nice and quiet semi-country setting.</p>
<p>Just before 16:00 (that&#8217;s 4:00 PM for some of you!) I recruit a colleague&#8217;s help in getting my gear downstairs and outside. I&#8217;m out and rolling! Tonight&#8217;s destination is Serenova Tract, 6533 acres of wilderness owned by SFWMD located near SR 52 &amp; Suncoast Parkway. Lucky for me, my route will take me near my house and I say, &#8220;Lucky&#8221; because I forgot something that I will need for the night. <a href="http://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1080299.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1306" title="Bike Shadow with trailer" src="http://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1080299-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>The ride from work to the house was pretty much uneventful; however, I did come across 6 cyclist loaded with gear heading the other direction. After a quick pitstop at the house, I&#8217;m rolling again and for the most part the heavy traffic is now behind me. About 45 minutes later I enter Starkey Park and it&#8217;s smooth sailing from here. The next 13 miles will be without automobiles aiming for me! Yep, nothing but deer, armadillo, and the rising of the, &#8220;Super Moon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somehow I mismanaged my time because I arrived at Serenova Tract after the Sun set, so it&#8217;s dark and I&#8217;m not sure where the primitive sites are. No worries as I head into the dark woods &#8230; well other than the thoughts of Jason from the Friday the 13th movies coming out and chopping me up into little pieces. All is well because about 3/4 of mile in I come upon a group of Scouts camping in the group campsite. <a href="http://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1080314.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1307" title="Overnighter I Camp" src="http://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1080314-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a> I ask one of the Scout Masters if he knew where the primitive sites were and he wasn&#8217;t sure either, but he believed they were further back another 2 miles. I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Great, I just rode 47 miles, it&#8217;s dark, and I might have another 2 miles on dirt roads, only to be killed by Jason!&#8221; Luckily, the Scout Master was wrong, the primitive sites were about 200 meters down the road. By now the &#8220;Super Moon&#8221; if fully up and shinning bright as ever through the trees. After picking my site, I set up camp &#8211; living quarters (tent), collect wood, start fire, and make chow. After chow, I do some Suduko and then it&#8217;s lights out.</p>
<p>Before I know it, the Sun is up and it&#8217;s time to get moving.<a href="http://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1080317.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1421" title="Ron &amp; his gear" src="http://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1080317-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a> After getting out of the fart sack (sleeping bag), I get the fire going, make a cup of Joe (coffee), and eat some breakfast before packing up and heading out. Life Is Good!</p>
