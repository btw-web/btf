<h1>Intro to our camping kitchen</h1>
<h3>How to Feed Two Hungry Cyclists</h3>
<p>There are many ways to feed a hungry cyclist and unfortunately there is no way to say which one is right or wrong . However, since we spent 2 years traveling on a bike and continue to do short bike tours around our area, we would like to share how we manage to feed these two hungry bicyclists, with an intro to our camping kitchen.</p>
<p><!--more-->First off, we&#8217;d like to mention, that we usually try&nbsp;to have one warm meal a day. Well, unless it is stifling hot outside, that&#8217;s when we&#8217;d rather have some fresh fruit. Other times it may not be feasible to cook something safely, then we resort to making sandwiches or eat tuna out of the can. Also, when we are touring, we burn a lot of calories which turns us into two <em>very</em> hungry cyclists. That&#8217;s when we generally double the food portions compared to what we usually eat.</p>

<p>We are not big fans of overpriced, packaged dry-freeze food. Instead we try to cook a regular meal. However, we have to be a little bit creative to do this, since we only have one burner and one pot to cook in.</p>
<p>So how do we do this? We try to figure out the best sequence to cook our food in and use the rest of our &#8220;camping kitchen&#8221; in a way to end up with a half way decent dinner.</p>
<h3>Let us introduce you to our camping kitchen&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The stove:</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://pedalpowertouring.com/gear/gear-reviews/msr-whisperlite-international-stove/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSR Whisperlite International Stove</a>. It has never failed us, works on white gas, which burns clean but is relatively pricey. It also works on regular gasoline, which causes more soot on the stove, but is much cheaper and much easier to come by in most countries.</p>
<h4>The pot and pan:</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://pedalpowertouring.com/gear/gear-reviews/gsi-outdoors-pinnacle-backpacker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GSI Outdoors Pinnacle Backpacker cookware. </a>&nbsp; It comes&nbsp;complete with a pot, small frying pan, and a lid that fits both. Also two insulated cups with lids and two other small cups, which slide into each other for storage are part of this set. There are measuring cup markings on the cups,&nbsp;which come in handy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pot and pan have the most remarkable non-stick coating, which makes cooking and clean up a breeze. &nbsp;The entire set stacks nicely into the pot itself and it still has enough room to fit most, if not all, of the spices we carry.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We also keep a corkscrew with a small knife, a P38 can opener, lighters and matches stowed away in our GSI cups.</p>
<p><a href="https://pedalpowertouring.com/gear/gear-reviews/gsi-outdoors-pinnacle-backpacker/attachment/sparrow_pan/" rel="attachment wp-att-6576"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-6576 size-full" src="https://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sparrow_pan.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sparrow_pan.jpg 800w, https://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sparrow_pan-300x199.jpg 300w, https://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sparrow_pan-700x466.jpg 700w, https://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/sparrow_pan-332x221.jpg 332w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<h4>The Dishes:</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We each have a 1/2 liter metal cup with lid, an &#8220;el cheapo&#8221; plastic plate (from the dollar store), Light My Fire titanium sporks (which we&nbsp;found&nbsp;in a campground where they were forgotten by an unfortunate person). We also carry one small plastic bowl (from the dollar store), which we use to mix things in or to make a small salad. It is also&nbsp;handy to protect cookies, chips or other fragile food in our&nbsp;panniers.</p>
<h4>Utensils:</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A small wooden spoon, a small &#8220;el cheapo&#8221; plastic spatula (from the dollar store), an &#8220;el cheapo&#8221; plastic cutting board (another dollar store special), and a small sharp knife.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The plastic and wooden utensils are important to protect the nonstick coating in the GSI Backpacker pot and pan.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Prepping the Food&nbsp;</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Obviously, we are not able to cook our noodles, meat, and veggies all at the same time. So often times, we will start with our basic food stables, such as cooking pasta, gnocchi, quinoa, rice, couscous etc. Once that is&nbsp;done we drain the water if necessary and place the cooked item either in the bowl we carry or onto one of the plates.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the mean time we chop up vegetables, onions, garlic, etc on the cutting board and place it on the other plate until it is ready to be cooked.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We usually buy fresh meat shortly before we make it to our campsite for the night. Although sometimes we have to use canned chicken or meat, if we have long distances to cover between possible resupply spots.</p>
<h4>How it&#8217;s all put together</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Generally we cook the meat second, especially, if we have sauce or gravy with it. We make sure it is well done and add the vegetables to the pot. We let it cook down to create a lot of flavor and maybe some sauce.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">At the end we will try and fit the pasta, quinoa or whatever we are having, back into the pot to mix it all up.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Since we are usually two very hungry cyclists, we can get a little bit crazy with the vegetables and it will not fit all back in the pot. That&#8217;s when we just divide the pasta or quinoa etc. up on the plates and the hot meat/vegetable/sauce mix will be enough to heat everything&nbsp;back up when we pour it over the pasta.</p>
<h4>One of our One Burner Meals</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is one example of what cooking a One Burner Meal will look like. Enjoy!</p>
