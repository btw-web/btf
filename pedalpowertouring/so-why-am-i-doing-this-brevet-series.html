<h1>So, Why Am I Doing a Brevet Series?</h1>
<p>Why am I going to torture my body and mind &#8211;again&#8211;this weekend to spend miles and miles on my bike while not even going to get a chance to win a medal for this torture?<br />
Those are just some of the questions going through my mind , while pedaling my bike home from a long day&#8217;s work.</p>
<div id="attachment_1200" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/P1030657.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1200" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1200 " title="Riding the L.O.S.T. " src="http://pedalpowertouring.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/P1030657-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"></a><p id="caption-attachment-1200" class="wp-caption-text">Riding the L.O.S.T.</p></div>
<div><span style="line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;">When Ron signed me up for this insane Brevet Series, my initial thoughts were: This is absolutely crazy! There is no way I could ever physically accomplish this, nor do I have the mental power to go through with this.</span></div>
<p>Believe it or not, despite my profession I am NOT a big fan of torture, especially if I am the one that has to endure it.&nbsp;<!--more--><br />
But then I went back to work and I realized, everyday I work with patients that have to endure much more agony and pain, who I give tasks to do that sometimes seem impossible for them to accomplish, and they go through with it, to be able to just take a few very painful steps in hopes to get back on with their lives.<br />
That&#8217;s when it kind of hit me, that it really doesn&#8217;t seem fair to tell somebody on the edge of giving up to keep trying the seemingly impossible without ever having had to master some similar seemingly impossible task myself.</p>
<p>And here it is&#8230;&#8230;.this series of rides may just be the remedy for my dilemma.</p>
<p>Although the 200km didn&#8217;t seem to be too bad, I am pretty sure that these next few rides will really test my physical and mental strengths.<br />
There will be plenty of times I&#8217;ll think that I just can&#8217;t keep going, plenty of times I will question my sanity, and many opportunities to call it quits,&nbsp;and of course there will be many sore muscles and tender spots on my body.<br />
However, I&#8217;ll just have to tell my self, like I tell my patients: You just have to hang in there, never give up, you are the only one that can do this for yourself, and you will be a much happier and accomplished person knowing you tried your best and didn&#8217;t quit when things got tough.</p>
<p>However, there is a breaking point for most of us, lets see where mine will be.</p>
