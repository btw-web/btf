<p><strong>Curious fact about Armenia:</strong> Many of our readers might already know that Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt Christianity (early 4th century). But what you might not know is that in Armenia, you will also find the oldest observatory known to man in the city of Qarahunge. The observatory was estimated to to be around 7, 500 years old by world renowned Armenian astronomer Paris Herouni .</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite typical dish in Armenia that you have tasted?<!--more--></strong></p>
<p>Sadly, we must say that we did not spend enough time in Armenia to be able to clearly name a dish. But for sure T&#8217;olma was one of our favorites. They are meat rolls with rice and spices wrapped inside wine leaves for the nice aroma. They go great with local white wine.</p>

<p><strong>What is the most popular game in Armenia?</strong></p>
<p>Well although some people may consider it more than a game, chess is very popular here in Armenia. Atough they are only a population of 3 million people they have won the last two world team chess championships. For Armenians since their heroe and legend Tigran Petrosian won in 1963 the World Chess Title, chess has become a healthy obsession for young and old.</p>
<p><strong>Who is considered the National Heroe and why?</strong></p>
<p>His name is Garegin Ter-Harutyunyan but he is more known by his war name Garegin Nzhdeh. He is remembered as an outstanding soldier and leader, as well as a liberator. As wikipedia says in March 2010 he was voted by the Armenias as their: “National pride and the most outstanding figure&#8221; through the Tv project Hay TV made by the countries biggest Tv network. When I asked our Armenian friend Tatevik why he is so higly regarded she aswered, “because of him where you are right now is part of Armenia (she was referring to the south part region called Syunik) ”.</p>
<p><strong>What is the most popular alcoholic beverage in Armenia?</strong></p>
<p>Well although cognac can only be named cognac if it was produced in France, here in Armenia the equivalent is highly regarded and very popular among Armenians. You can see many stores offering diverse brands in elegant bottles, I even saw some with replica sables of medieval times as gifts in the box. They also produce wine and of course beer.</p>

<p><strong>Who is the musical group on Armenia loved by young and old?</strong></p>
<p>Our friend Tatevik was kind enough to share us many groups and songs, but since it is already hard to pic a favorite I chose this piece called Krunk, at least that was the heading of the title in youtube. The song is about the people ho are left behind in their homeland and have to wait for their family and friends return. This song has to be very important, because it is estimated that half  of the population of Armenians world wide do not live in Armenia. Imagine how that song must feel to them.</p>

<p><strong>What is the most common brand of cars in Armenia?</strong></p>
<p>Well being on the road you get to see many cars. They might not be the most popular but for certain there were the ones that we saw the most. We are talking about the LADA, the legendary relique of soviet times that was once the symbol of city life in the Soviet Union.</p>
