<p><strong>A local Joke?</strong><br />
In Buchara, there is a statue of a celebrate muslim: Nasreddin Afandi. Although it is still debated whether or not he is originally from Uzbekistan, the people here often cite his fables. His stories are often charged with a lot of sense of humor to teach the young ones big lessons in life. Here is one of our favorite examples:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>Reaching </strong><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Enlightenment</strong></span> </dd>
<dd>Nasreddin was walking in the bazaar with a large group of followers. Whatever Nasreddin did, his followers immediately copied. Every few steps Nasreddin would stop and shake his hands in the air, touch his feet and jump up yelling &#8220;Hu Hu Hu!&#8221;. So his followers would also stop and do exactly the same thing.</dd>
<dd>One of the merchants, who knew Nasreddin, quietly asked him: &#8220;What are you doing my old friend? Why are these people imitating you?&#8221;</dd>
<dd>&#8220;I have become a Sufi Sheikh,&#8221; replied Nasreddin. &#8220;These are my Murids (spiritual seekers); I am helping them reach enlightenment!&#8221;</dd>
<dd>&#8220;How do you know when they reach enlightenment?&#8221;</dd>
<dd>&#8220;That’s the easy part! Every morning I count them. The ones who have left – have reached enlightenment!&#8221;</dd>

<p><strong>What is Uzbekistan´s National Favorite Sport?</strong><br />

<p><strong>Who is Uzbekistan´s National Hero?</strong><br />
According to Mark Dickens, author of the book A Pheonix Rises in the Desert, Timur has now been officially recognized as a national hero of newly independent Uzbekistan. His monument in Tashkent now occupies the place where Marx&#8217;s statue once stood</p>
<p>Timur, like most conquerors, is praised by the ruling side and condemned by the conquered part. He brought scientists to teach and artists to decorate his capital Samarkand from the lands he had conquered, that extended all the way to Georgia and Bagdad to the south. His conquering methods were feared throughout by neighboring empires such as the Chinese. His warfare planning was meticulously organized months in advance. He did not pay the soldiers but left them the opportunity to get a hold of everything they could, which meant woman, jewels, cattle, horses and other valuables. Perhaps that explains why people feared him, more that a war most of the times it felt like a raid. To learn more about him click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir_Timur">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How many letters are there in your alphabet?</strong><br />
During the soviet times Uzbekistan people used Cyrillic letters for the written language. After their independence in 1991 the government changed this by introducing a 29 letter alphabet system based on Latin characters.</p>
<p><strong>Special Fact</strong><br />
Another curious fact is that their currency contains only four types of bank notes, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 Soum. The problem is that 1,000 Soum is about 50 cents of a dollar. Imagine now how it’s like to carry 100 Dlls? So it is very common to see people carrying shopping bags of currency from place to place, specially the truck drivers.</p>
