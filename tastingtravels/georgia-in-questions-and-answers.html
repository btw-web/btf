<p><strong>Curious Fact of Georgia:</strong> Georgians believe Georgia is the home of wine. The theory is sustained in two curious facts: the word wine derives from the georgian wine ghvino and archeological excavations prove that wine was made in Georgia<!--more--> seven thousand years ago. For this and many other reasons wine making here in Georgia is serious. Home made wine is more than common, even in the cities, because it is used as a way to welcome any guest at any time. For Georgians a guest is considered a God&#8217;s gift.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite typical dish in Georgia that you have tasted?</strong></p>
<p>We have two favorite dishes among the various gastronomical offer here in Georgia. One of them is the delicious Khachapuri, a cheese bread that can be bought freshly baked in every bakery. The other dish is the Khinkali, a variety of dumplings filled with ground meat, herbs and its juice. To eat Khinkali one must avoid at all costs dripping the juice from the dough, the cost if you do, a loss of spectacular falvour in your mouth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is the most popular sport in Georgia?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is the most popular alcoholic beverage?</strong></p>
<p>Chacha which is also called Georgian Vodka, is definetely the most popular alcoholic beverage. One of the main reasons is that wine and beer do not compete in this category because they are considered to soft to be cataloged as alcoholic beverage. Chacha is made of grape residue, the grape that is left after making wine.</p>
<p><strong>Who’s the national hero and why?</strong></p>
<p>In many places all through Georgia two images are recurrently found in sculptures and paintings: King David the Builder and his great grand daughter Queen Tamara, who is also called King Tamara as a way to venerate her greatness. These two kings were responsible for the Golden Age of Georgian were the most important constructions where built and Georgians lived in peace free from invasions and war. An interesting fact was that David the Builder initiated the golden period by kicking away the Seljuk Turks and two decades after King Tamara&#8217;s death the period ended with the Mongol invasion.</p>
