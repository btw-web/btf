<p>So with no further due here our top picks:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><a href="http://www.mexicoescultura.com/recinto/51716/en/Tijuana%2520Cultural%2520Center%2520(CECUT).html"><b>1- Cecut and El Cubo</b></a></span><span class="s2"><b>: </b>Build by world renowned architects Pedro Ramirez Vasquez and Manuel Rosen Morrison, this building is the icon of our city and offers so many activities, you might actually spend a whole day there. The Museo de las Californias for example is a museum that teaches you all you need to know about the local indigenous groups, the early settlers, the history of the Baja California and of Tijuana itself. There is an IMAX cinema where you can experience some of the best documentaries on nature and anthropology to date. We also fell in love with the arts exhibitions and with the regular cultural events from handicraft expositions to a Chinese New Year parade. For more information click the title.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s3"><a href="http://www.descubretijuana.com/en/attractions/arts-and-culture/malecon-de-playas"><b>2- Have a coffe in the Malecon Playas</b></a></span><span class="s2"><b>: </b>Playas de Tijuana is the northernmost part of Mexico. Here you will get to see the famous fence that extends all the way up to the ocean. On summer weekends the beach will be full with families, on windy afternoons you can see kites all over the place, in the early morning there will be lots of people working out and on weekend evenings you might see one of the free clown shows. Sometimes there are public events at Playas de Tijuana, especially on the weekends. Or you can always grab some ice cream or a coconut and stroll the boardwalk. You can explore coffee shops, jeweler stands, great food and bars. So have a zip or two of your favorite drink while watching the ocean. You can definitely take your bike, although you’re not allowed to ride it on the boardwalk. There are a couple of places to securely park bikes though.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>3- Weekend night life in Avenida Revolución: </b>While cycling, one of the things that I missed was being able to have a nice drink at a bar. North of the border a beer can cost you anywhere from 4 to 8 Dollars. Cocktails were off the budget even on special occasions. However here in Tijuana and especially in Avenida Revolución there are places where you can get a liter of beer for around 3 dollars, Amen to that. The music is great with different choices, especially in Calle 6ta (6</span><span class="s4"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s2"> street). You might want to bring your ID, because some places check. The 6ta and “Revu” are full of interesting bars, places to eat and even craft beer. Ah did you know that Tijuana is considered the craft beer capital of Mexico? But if you can’t live the hype on the weekend, do not worry during the day the “Revu” is full of color, culture, life and food.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_13512" style="width: 693px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7033.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-13512"><img class="size-large wp-image-13512" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7033-683x1024.jpg" alt="Ave Revolución" width="683" height="1024" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7033-683x1024.jpg 683w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7033-200x300.jpg 200w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7033-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7033-37x55.jpg 37w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ave Revolución</p></div>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Places we recommend:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5"><a href="http://www.descubretijuana.com/es/atractivos/porkys-place">Porky´s Place</a></span><span class="s2"> where you can rock to 80s, 90s and newer music in English and Spanish. Sometimes there is live music on the weekends. The Porky’s has a dancefloor and two big balconies overlooking the craziness down in the streets. 20 Pesos cover and 40-50 Pesos for a liter of beer. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/lamezcaleratj/info/?tab=overview">La Mezcalería</a></span><span class="s2"> where you can try 18 different types of mescal, eat chapulines (fried grasshoppers) and all kinds of music from Indie to light Electro. No cover. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/El-DANDY-DEL-SUR-341628149320649/info/">Dandy del Sur</a></span><span class="s2"> where young and old meet. This is a traditional and historical Cantina with a very mixed group of visitors. Even the toilets have swing doors! Good promotions on local cocktails (50 Pesos for two) other than the usual Margarita. Music varies (they have a jukebox), no cover. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5"><a href="http://laspulgas.info/ubicacion">Las Pulgas</a></span><span class="s2"> the place to party like there’s no tomorrow. This is where you might end up when everything else has closed but you still want to rock on. There are several dance floors with different music: Rock, Pop, Salsa, 70s, 80s, 90s, Banda, Country and so on. They often host concerts. The cover varies. Open till late. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>4- Visit </b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZAZ71LC6zeJ2"><span class="s6"><b>Mercado Hidalgo</b></span></a><b>: </b>I consider myself fairly weathered in Mexico. I have visited several markets all over the country and Mercado Hidalgo is truly one of Mexico’s jewels. Situated in walking distance to the CECUT, it is clean, beautiful, colorful and cheap if you compare it to the US, especially on the produce. The first time I went there I was amazed that for 2 USD I could buy a kilo of avocados! I invite you to explore the place, walk around and just gorge yourself with the offer of food, candy, piñatas, classic Mexican kitchen utensils and more. It is eye candy everywhere you look and you might find yourself walking out with the bags full of some juicy tuna (cactus fruit), a colorful apron, spicy mango snacks, creamy cajeta (similar to caramel) and a one-meter Donald Trump Piñata.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_13513"  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSCN2752.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-13513"><img class="size-large wp-image-13513" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSCN2752-1024x768.jpg" alt="Variety of Fresh Produce in mercado Hidalgo"  srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSCN2752-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSCN2752-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSCN2752-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSCN2752-73x55.jpg 73w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSCN2752-75x55.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Variety of Fresh Produce in mercado Hidalgo</p></div>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>5- Visit the Pasajes</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The pasajes in downtown once were secret corridors where casinos were concealed to the authorities. Yes, there were casino here and they were illegal, most of them during the prohibition. Today these corridors are just plain, simple cool and full of life You can buy local clothing brands, craft beer, second hand books, souvenirs, explore culture, enjoy good food and . We recommend you to stroll around these ones in particular:</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>6- Food truck bike tour</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It is no secret, food here is absolutely amazing! And the food truck culture has contributed to the boom of this movement in a great way. Amazing world class food at an affordable price. The offer is limitless. There are seafood tostadas, lime flavored water with cucumber, fresh burgers, vegan food, sweet desserts, vegetarian food, meat lovers’ food, Mexican fusion, Greek, Italian, Chinese, Japanese and South American. If that’s not enough, the tacos will blow your mind. Just imagine marlin fish tacos and shrimp quesadillas with all the fresh helpings you can imagine. Most of the food trucks offer craft beer as well as wine form the region. Try everything you can, because food in Tijuana is taken very seriously and you will miss it once you are gone. So grab your bike, ride a lot, and jump from one food truck to another. We suggest:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s8">Food Truck@ <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Wy1mPNEio1z"><span class="s5">La Telefónica</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s8">Foodgarden@ <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/tDmYAsD11Zv"><span class="s5">Sanchez Taboada</span></a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>7- Sporting events </b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Tijuana is a big city, and like all big cities there are many events going on. Of all the events that ones that get the locals more excited are the sporting events. We host three professional teams in three different exciting sports: football (soccer), basketball and baseball. The people from Tijuana are very passionate so the atmosphere before and during the games is truly inspiring. So go out and check out a soccer game in Mexico’s competitive first league soccer team <a href="http://www.xolos.com.mx/en"><span class="s6">XOLOS</span></a>. Or cheer every point our basketball team makes. The <a href="http://tijuanazonkeys.com.mx/"><span class="s6">Zonkeys</span></a> are named after the donkeys dressed like zebras (a local icon you can see in Avenida Revolución). Finally there is our baseball team, the <a href="http://www.torosdetijuana.com/"><span class="s6">Toros</span></a>. They offer the cheapest tickets, resulting in high assistance and lots of beer drinking opportunities while watching a good game of baseball.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>8- </b><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/88QAyRCjax92"><span class="s6"><b>Plaza Fiesta</b></span></a><b> beer frenzy</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Yes I know it is not always about beer, but Baja California is the capital of craft beer in Mexico. Labels like Insurgente are experimenting in beer with Mexican chocolate flavor as well as other that have orange flavor and good old fashion wheat German style beers. You can try most of the in Plaza Fiesta a plaza that is filled with microbreweries and bars. Tip: in this plaza food is also awesome. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">In fact the offer is so big, there are 100 local beer brands in Tijuana to choose from. So in order to guide yourself in this world we suggest downloading its own guide, the guide to craft beer in Mexico. So that you can download the PDF <a href="http://images.descubretijuana.com/descargas/GuiaCervezaArtesanal.pdf"><span class="s6">here</span></a>.<br />
By the way: in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Hz4c4toUW352"><span class="s6">BCB Tasting Room</span></a> (about 2 Kilometers from Plaza Fiesta) there is a 11-page menu full of beers, the first page are draft beers only. So yes, the Tijuananses really love their beer. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>9- Parks and gardens</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">I know Tijuana is not known for its green spacious areas. However there are such places and they are quite neat. <a href="http://discoverbajacalifornia.com/index.php/que-hacer-tijuana/entretenimiento-tijuana/item/parque-morelos"><span class="s6">Parque Morelos</span></a> has its own (free) zoo and a paint ball park, <a href="http://discoverbajacalifornia.com/index.php/que-hacer-tijuana/entretenimiento-tijuana/item/parque-teniente-guerrero"><span class="s6">Parque Teniente Guerrero</span></a> is situated near the center, <a href="http://discoverbajacalifornia.com/index.php/que-hacer-tijuana/entretenimiento-tijuana/item/parque-de-la-amistad"><span class="s6">Parque de la Amistad</span></a> has a big lake, and the small <a href="http://www.friendshippark.org/"><span class="s6">Friendship Park</span></a> where they often host cultural events. They are yours for a relaxing bike ride through the trees and the greenery. There are games for children in all of them.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s2"><b>10- TACOS and TACOS (see list)</b></span></p>
