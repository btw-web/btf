<p lang="en-US">November 2013: By bike to Singapore: When things work even better than expected</p>
<p lang="en-NZ">I woke up in panic, jumped out of the bed, watched out of the window and thought “Oh no, the sun is out already! We overslept, we need to hurry, hurry, hurry!” Then I stopped moving for a moment and wondered where I was. It took quite a while until I understood that we were in Akira’s guest room in Singapore and that the run against the time had come to an end – we managed to arrive in Singapore on our very last day of visa.</p>
<div id="attachment_9701" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Akira_Dinner2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9701" alt="Japanese dinner with our friend Akira" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Akira_Dinner2.jpg" width="600" height="450" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Akira_Dinner2.jpg 600w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Akira_Dinner2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Akira_Dinner2-73x55.jpg 73w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Akira_Dinner2-75x55.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Japanese dinner with our friend Akira</p></div>
<p>We got ready and went to discover the rooftop of Akira’s condominium. Since it was a workday’s morning, we were the only ones. It was not easy to decide what to do. Shall we enter the steam bath first, then swim some laps in the 70 meters long pool and later relax in the Jacuzzi or would it be better to start with the sports and have both, Jacuzzi and steam bath as a treat for the good work? I could not stop myself and swam more than 2 kilometers nonstop. It was just too great.</p>
<div id="attachment_9704" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Pool1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9704" alt="A 75 Meter long swimming pool in Singapore" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Pool1.jpg" width="450" height="600" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Pool1.jpg 450w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Pool1-225x300.jpg 225w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Pool1-41x55.jpg 41w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Can you believe what you see there? We hardly could.</p></div>
<p>We spent a while with Akira, went out for Japanese food, cooked Mexican food, prepared German sandwiches, met our friends Dila and Apit, got a new tyre for Roberto’s bike and worked on our to do list. Our<a href="http://shop.reelight.com/bicycle-lights/20-rl700-set/" target="_blank"> relight bicycle lights</a> had arrived to Dila’s place and we were very excited to try them out. They work with a dynamo powered by six magnets on the spokes and there was no need to ever charge the batteries, switch the lights off after the rain or pedal hard with the hub dynamo.</p>

<p>Singapore city was full of lights, so we are just happy to be seen by others with our lights, but in the countryside our strong lights would make it so much easier to find a place to sleep. Now we do not need to be afraid of rain, fog, tunnels and the sunset anymore.</p>
<div id="attachment_9711" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Sushi1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9711" alt="Sushi is my absolute favorite food and Akire showed us how many varieties there are in Japanese food." src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Sushi1.jpg" width="600" height="450" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Sushi1.jpg 600w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Sushi1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Sushi1-73x55.jpg 73w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Sushi1-75x55.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sushi is my absolute favorite food and Akire showed us how many varieties there are in Japanese food.</p></div>
<p lang="en-NZ">We did not take the public transport once and I guess we must have cycled some 150-200 Kilometers in town. Another big to-do thing on our list was, to replace my old laptop with a new one and get a proper lens for Roberto’s camera before we would arrive to more expensive places such as Australia and New Zealand. So we visited the Food and Electronics Expo and got to know the entire Sim Lim Square. One day we met Swee, a local cyclist, who rides his two girls to school every day with a triple-tandem, to prove that it is possible to use a bike as a means of transportation. Swee had also met our friends Philipp and Pascale from Switzerland and Bärbel and Johan from Germany and the Netherlands and that was how he found out about us.</p>

<p>Swee had been cycling from Norway back home nine years ago and of course we had a lot of things to talk about. Later it turned out that he used to work for the Shimano plant in Singapore, the oldest plant outside of Japan, and that he had told his ex-boss about us and our bikes. His boss was rather impressed that we rode for some 14.000 kilometers with baggage (and who knows how many without bags; the bikes were second hand and we ride a lot through towns and make daytrips as well) on the most basic original Shimano parts.</p>
<div id="attachment_9708" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Roberto_Swee1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9708" alt="Lunch with Swee.

<p>He wanted to see them. For him it was a good possibility to see how his parts work and what there is to improve when they are used nearly daily under offroad conditions in rain, snow, desert and dirt. Well, since he wanted to keep our old parts, he offered us to change them with brand new parts – for free! We could not believe our luck. Two Shimano mechanics took hands on our old bikes and equipped them with all kinds of fancy Shimano gadgets!</p>
<div id="attachment_9707" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Shimano-Team1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9707" alt="Before ..." src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Shimano-Team1.jpg" width="600" height="450" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Shimano-Team1.jpg 600w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Shimano-Team1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Shimano-Team1-73x55.jpg 73w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Shimano-Team1-75x55.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Before &#8230;</p></div>
<p>We got a tour through the factory and in the late afternoon the bikes were ready. I have to say they ran as if they were buttered. My bike had 27 gears and a proper working front brake, the shifters, derailleurs, cables and tubes were brand new and it ran much smoother than with the old ones. In order to change a gear I barely needed to touch the shifter. Times are over when my thumb hurt from changing gears and when there was this squeaking sound inside the shifters. In that same night we took the ferry to the Indonesian island of Batam, one hour from Singapore.</p>
<div id="attachment_9706" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Shimano_team_afterwards1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9706" alt="... and after" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Shimano_team_afterwards1.jpg" width="600" height="450" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Shimano_team_afterwards1.jpg 600w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Shimano_team_afterwards1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Shimano_team_afterwards1-73x55.jpg 73w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Shimano_team_afterwards1-67x50.jpg 67w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Shimano_team_afterwards1-75x55.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8230; and after</p></div>
<p>The ticket salesman shook his head when we presented our passports. “You don’t have a visa”, he told Roberto. “I don’t need one”, he replied. “Yes, you do!”, “No I don’t, I get a visa on arrival.” “No you don’t!” They argued for a while until the salesman checked his papers to find out that Roberto was right. The man next to us had his passport covered in a bright yellow Corona-cover. I couldn’t stop myself from saying “Oh, and he probably doesn’t need a visa either” and pointing on the Corona-Passport.</p>

<p>The man behind the passport smiled from ear to ear. His name was Eric and he was a Mexican-American living in Batam with his wife and two kids. We got some beers to shorten the ferry ride (the ferry moved as if the captain had had some beers as well) and arriving on the other side Eric invited us and our host Boaz from Australia for a Barbecue at his place the following day.</p>
<p lang="en-NZ"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Boaz-and-Roberto.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9714" alt="Boaz and Roberto" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Boaz-and-Roberto.jpg" width="600" height="450" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Boaz-and-Roberto.jpg 600w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Boaz-and-Roberto-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Boaz-and-Roberto-73x55.jpg 73w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Boaz-and-Roberto-75x55.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p lang="en-NZ">Boaz picked us up at the ferry terminal and we followed him on his motorbike back home. He was a 21-year old English teacher and was very excited to meet us. So were we.</p>
<p>For the following day he had asked some friends to join us for a surprise trip to a waterfall. Austin, Samantha, Joe and Jennifer were in Indonesia for a cultural exchange program, Katie was their supervisor, Dian was a taxi driver, Ani was her friend and Daniel was a graphic designer.</p>
<div id="attachment_9713" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Waterfall_trekking1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9713" alt="Hiking to Batam's waterfall" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Waterfall_trekking1.jpg" width="450" height="600" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Waterfall_trekking1.jpg 450w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Waterfall_trekking1-225x300.jpg 225w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Waterfall_trekking1-41x55.jpg 41w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hiking to Batam&#8217;s waterfall</p></div>
<p>We hiked around a lake for an hour, crossed two small wooden bridges made out of a single log and one underwater bridge before we arrived to the waterfall. We jumped, swam and enjoyed the sun while it shone. It was barely noon when we headed back and Boaz, Roberto and I were really in need of a power nap.</p>

<p lang="en-NZ">At night Eric (who we barely met) invited us, Boaz’s friend Jack and our new friends (who he had never met) over to his place for a barbecue with Indonesian and Mexican food. Eric’s wife Retno took good care that nobody ever held an empty glass. Her aunt had prepared the most delicious Indonesian food and Eric and Roberto took care for the meat. Eric had even prepared a big pot of spicy Guacamole and Samantha had made Mexican Tortillas at home! We had an amazing night and it was way past midnight when we headed back home. In 24 hours we had made so many good friends, we still could not believe it.</p>

<p lang="en-NZ">We spent the week working during the day and having fun with our new friends during the evening. On the second weekend we visited an abandoned Vietnamese refuge in one of the southern islands connected with Batam through some bridges. Boaz and his father Phil had been there before and explained everything to us. His partner Reni, Daniel’s brother Gideon and Boaz’ friends Emily and Jordan also joined us. At night we went to the cinema for the second time already.</p>
