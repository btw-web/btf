<p>Monday, 18<sup>th</sup> of June 2012</p>
<p>Georgian summer is hot, really hot. Good thing: Roberto can wash his shirt in the river and it dries in less than half an hour. Bad thing: We are forced to get up early and cycling in the sun can be quite hard.<!--more--></p>
<p>Though we only carry <strong>2 Liters of water each</strong> we have to stop several times to fill up the bottles. Fortunately there are plenty of taps to use.</p>

<p><strong>Cycling to Tbilisi</strong></p>
<p>I was a bit frightened of the mountains we had to climb up, though it was said to be 50 km of straight uphill. Fortunately that was not true. We cycled some hills for about 30 kilometers and enjoyed the view on the river and some villages and only the last 10 kilometers were tough.</p>
<p><strong>“Welcome to Georgia”</strong></p>
<p>The road was fine and the traffic not to bad either. We just went on from our breakfast break when a car stopped in front of us. A small man with a big smile opened the door and came running towards us. We stopped. The man smiled even more. “Welcome to Georgia!” he said and handed me a huge basket of strawberries. I was completely taken aback, took the basket and grinned stupidly. “Thank you” I answered, too baffled to think about anything else to say. Roberto asked for the man’s name and where he comes from, but he was in a big hurry and after we took a picture together he waved, repeated his <strong>warm welcome</strong> and ran back to the car. So there we stood. The bikes were full and the basket enormous. I considered eating all the strawberries right away but it was just too much. Apart we have already had some for breakfast. So I squeezed them into my front basket.</p>
<div id="attachment_7381" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030532.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7381" alt="He just made me very very happy.

Strawberries are some of my very favorites</p></div>
<p>That was exactly the <strong>motivation</strong> I had been looking for. Whenever I was fed up with the steep uphill I just grabbed a few strawberries and felt better immediately. We went up and up on about 1000 meters, then we saw the salvation: <strong>the tunnel</strong>. “We just cross that one and then we can go all downhill!”</p>
<div id="attachment_7384" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030560.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7384" alt="Down into the evening shower" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030560.jpg" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030560.jpg 640w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030560-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030560-600x450.jpg 600w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030560-73x55.jpg 73w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030560-75x55.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Down into the evening shower</p></div>
<p>Fortunately the road was in a very good condition so we enjoyed a relaxing downhill with some wind in the face. When the daily afternoon-rain was about to start we looked out for a shelter and found it in a bread stand, where we made friends with the owner immediately. We shared some of our strawberries with her and her friends and family from the neighbor stand and I think an old lady had a little crush on Roberto. She kept smiling at him and petted his shoulder.</p>

<p>This night we camped in a farmer’s field. All the children and teenagers were very curious on us and when the tent was up they invited Roberto for a football match. He forgot about his tired legs and played in the rain until the sun set. For dinner we had – what else could it be? – Yoghurt with strawberries. Same for breakfast by the way.</p>

<p><strong>Discovering a castle off the track</strong></p>
<p>The following day was the hottest of them all. In the sun the temperature rose <strong>up to 47°C</strong> and in the shadow on 32°C. We decided to leave the busy main road and discover one of the smaller sideways.</p>
<div id="attachment_7388" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030590.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7388" alt="Nothing but green green fields, flowers and the big sky" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030590.jpg" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030590.jpg 640w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030590-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030590-600x450.jpg 600w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030590-73x55.jpg 73w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030590-75x55.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nothing but green green fields, flowers and the big sky</p></div>
<p>It took us half a day to cycle just a few kilometers but it was definitely worth the effort. To both sides of the road there was nothing but flowers, fields, the <strong>Caucasus</strong> to our left and the Little Caucasus to our right. The road was alright, partly covered with pavement, partly not.</p>
<div id="attachment_7385" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030575.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7385" alt="No place I'd rather be" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030575.jpg" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030575.jpg 640w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030575-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030575-600x450.jpg 600w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030575-73x55.jpg 73w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030575-75x55.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">No place I&#8217;d rather be</p></div>
<p>Off the track we discovered <strong>an old castle</strong> on the hill. We walked the bikes up to find out that the “castle” was a nunnery and the church was full of pictures. Roberto loved them, I can’t tell because with shorts and shirt I could not enter.</p>
<div id="attachment_7380" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Batumi-Tiblisi-006.2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7380" alt="It looks like an old castle that has not seen visitors for quite a while ..." src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Batumi-Tiblisi-006.2.jpg" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Batumi-Tiblisi-006.2.jpg 640w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Batumi-Tiblisi-006.2-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Batumi-Tiblisi-006.2-600x399.jpg 600w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Batumi-Tiblisi-006.2-82x55.jpg 82w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It looks like an old castle that has not seen visitors for quite a while &#8230;</p></div>
<p><strong>Police control</strong></p>
<p>Somehow the road led us back to the main road which changed into a freeway. We had our own shoulder to cycle on! We had just stopped to drink water when a police car comes closer. The car stopped and an officer came out. My mind started running.</p>
<div id="attachment_7387" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030585.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7387" alt="In the countryside" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030585.jpg" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030585.jpg 640w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030585-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030585-600x450.jpg 600w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030585-73x55.jpg 73w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030585-75x55.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In the countryside</p></div>
<p>What will they do to us? Well, theoretically there was never a sign telling that cycling was <em>not</em> allowed on the freeway. Will they ask for a bribe? Will they force us to get back a smaller road? <em>Is there</em> a smaller road leading to Tbilisi?</p>
<p>I forgot about all my preoccupations when I saw <strong>the officer’s smile</strong>. “Where are you from?” he asked. “And where do you go?” We told him about our travel. His smile got even bigger. “Is there anything you need?” We both shook our heads. “We just filled our water bottles up and we were well prepared.</p>
<p>The officer was curious and we spent some time chatting, us on the shoulder, them on the right lane. I felt bad for having had such bad preconceptions. He is a policeman, but that does not make him automatically a bad person.</p>
<p><strong>“Why don’t you speak Russian?”</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_7379" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030605.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7379" alt="Goose traffic" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030605.jpg" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030605.jpg 640w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030605-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030605-600x450.jpg 600w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030605-73x55.jpg 73w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/P1030605-75x55.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Goose traffic</p></div>
<p>In the two hours on the freeway we cycled more kilometers that during the rest of the day on the small streets. There was not a lot to see, not many reasons to stop and a lot of space for cyclists. One hour before sunset we started looking for a <strong>place to camp</strong>. In a village we ran into Nino and her mother.</p>
<p>Ninos mother got upset when she found out that we did not speak any Russian. “All these years they taught me Russian at school and now I finally get to meet some tourists and they do not speak it!”, she complained with a smile. Her daughters Nino and Anna did know a little English and suggested us to camp on the village’s <strong>soccer field</strong>. They walked with us through the entire village and presented us to everybody they met on the way. I think there are not too many tourists on the way and they were proud to be our guides.</p>
<p>For the following day we had less than 60 kilometers to go for the capital Tbilisi.</p>
