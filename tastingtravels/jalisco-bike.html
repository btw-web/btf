<p>It was a cloudy, grey morning in Ixtlán del Río, but we started the day early nonetheless. There were thunderstorms forecasted for the afternoon and we did not want to end up on a mountain when they hit in. Our legs still hurt a little from all those climbs, but we tried to hurry. I feel like we shouldn’t take thunderstorms with lightning too lightly.</p>

<p>We biked up through the clouds and reached a green area with vines that hung all the way down onto the road. The cicadas chirped loudly and somewhere in the forest there was a waterfall to be seen. After a while up there we rolled all the way back down into a canyon full of large fields, cows and lots of grass. On the following climb we returned to the forested areas, but this it smelled like needle trees! The deciduous trees mixed up with pine trees and provided a whole different kind of atmosphere. It was impressive to see how quickly the vegetation changed here.</p>

<p>Of course we came well prepared. Ever since we had gotten ourselves a smartphone, things had changed drastically. No more pieces of paper that had awkward route descriptions on them, that never seemed to match with the map or the roads in real life. No, now we had the route in google maps plus a screenshot of today’s elevation profile! But somehow nothing seemed to match again. We climbed where we should have dropped, rolled down where we should have climbed and fought the hills where it should have been all flat as a pancake. It wasn’t until we actually reached a flat area, that I realized my mistake. I had entered the route reverse and the chart was the wrong way around. That explained a lot of confusion.</p>

<p>In Magdalena we left the “autopista” behind us and returned to the “libre”. Traffic was much easier and we even had a narrow shoulder most of the time. Out of a sudden there were agave fields all over the place. We had entered the next state: Jalisco. Jalisco was birthplace of the Tequila and up to this day it is the state, where the world’s Tequila came from. Trucks loaded all the way up with blue agave plants overtook us on our way to today’s target: The Pueblo Mágico “Tequila”.</p>

<p>Most of Jalisco’s Tequila factories were situated in and around Tequila. A few years ago we had already visited a factory and learned about the process, so today we took a stroll through the historic old town instead. Although Mexico had strict laws against public drinking, Tequila seemed to be an exception. We bought a cupful of Tequila with fresh pressed orange, grapefruit, lime, ice cubes, salt, chili powder and grapefruit soda for our walk. The pretty clay cup was included in the price.</p>

<p>Since camping in towns was not an easy thing to do, we had followed the advice of a local cyclist and found ourselves a bed. A nice lady, who rented her garden for events plus a house for overnight stays, had rented us one room in said house. She had a great eye for plants and we enjoyed the view into her garden.</p>

<p>The thunder woke us up, before the alarm clock did. We had gotten used to the thunderstorms every morning. Rainy season in Jalisco usually meant warm and sunny or cloudy days, and rainy evenings and nights. Only this morning the rain didn’t seem to stop.</p>
<div id="attachment_14240"  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_20160705_084050.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-14240"><img class="size-large wp-image-14240" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_20160705_084050-576x1024.jpg" alt="Flooded street in Tequila, Jalisco" width="576" height="1024" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_20160705_084050-576x1024.jpg 576w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_20160705_084050-169x300.jpg 169w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_20160705_084050-768x1365.jpg 768w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_20160705_084050-31x55.jpg 31w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s safe to say it wasn&#8217;t optimal cycling weather.

<p>I couldn’t have been happier, this was a great excuse to give those legs an extra few hours of rest. The street outside our window looked like a river, so Roberto watched TV and I read my book. The rain was lighter by 10.30 and we got going. At least we wouldn’t need any lengthy noon breaks in this weather.</p>
<div id="attachment_14235"  class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_20160704_161955.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-14235"><img class="size-large wp-image-14235" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_20160704_161955-1024x576.jpg" alt="Blue Agave fields" width="980" height="551" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_20160704_161955-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_20160704_161955-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_20160704_161955-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_20160704_161955-98x55.jpg 98w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cycling into Tequila: One day these guys will be turned into Tequila!</p></div>
<p>We got on the bikes and the heavy rain returned. Never mind. It was only 60 kilometers and we would be at our friend’s house in Guadalajara. Traffic was getting heavier again and as soon as we left Tequila behind us, the shoulder disappeared. We were so highly concentrated, we tensed up and hurt our necks, shoulders and arms. Every now and then we would spot a truck in our mirrors and stop in the bushes. You never know if they will slow down for you, squeeze past you or not even see you. Better safe than sorry. Also we know how much work it is for a truck driver to slow down to our speed and then accelerate again.</p>

She prepared a big cup full of fun and deliciousness in no time.</p></div>
<p>While we were waiting for some trucks to pass, three playing dogs ran straight towards the road. Two stopped just in time, but the first one ran right into an oncoming truck. It all happened so fast. My eyes filled up with tears immediately. It took another two cars until the dog was dead. A young man from a neighboring house grabbed the dog by the legs and dragged it away. It wasn’t his and he didn’t know if it had any owner.</p>

<p>There had been so many dead animals on the road in the past 28,000 kilometers. Oftentimes we smelled them before we even saw them. But this was the first time we witnessed such a terrible accident. It took me quite a while to calm down enough to continue cycling. It was a sad experience that kept us thinking all day, for quite some days in fact. From here on we spent more time waiting on the side of the road, than cycling the road.</p>

<p>After 20 very hard kilometers the road opened up and so did the clouds. It was dry and there was a wide shoulder and two lanes on each side. We met six walking men with bags. They came from Honduras and were on the way to the “Bestia”, the cargo train that went all the way up north into the USA. We shared our granola bars and water. These men still had quite a walk ahead.</p>

<p>The last 20 kilometers were hard. Guadalajara is Mexico’s second biggest city and the tenth biggest in all of Latin America. You can imagine the traffic in the outskirts. Of course there was no shoulder to be seen and the roads were narrow and full of potholes. Drivers overtook us so close and so quickly.</p>

<p>In my mind the very next car would knock away my handlebar and throw me off my bike. So we tensed up and biked as fast as we could as far to the right as we could in the straightest line possible until there was a driveway where we could stop and breathe. Long story short: today was not much cycling fun. At least it was only 500 meters of total climbing.</p>

<p>We reached the Colonia Americana neighborhood and finally all the tension disappeared. A few blocks later we reached the place we it had all begun seven years ago: Our little flat in Calle Libertad. I was an exchange student when I moved into Roberto’s shared apartment on day one in Mexico. We looked up to the balcony where we used to drink beer, laugh, dance, play card games and listen to music. The new tenants own a BBQ and a plant.</p>

<p>Guadalajara has changed a lot in these seven years. Back in my days the city’s one and only bicycle lane was on my way from home to my campus. Now the entire neighborhood was a bicycle-priority-road system. There were plenty of brand new bars and restaurants and quite some new towers and tall buildings.</p>

<p>Only two things never changed. Monday to Saturday you’d wake up to the jingle of “Zeta Zeta Zeta Gaaaas” (imagine an ice cream truck selling you gas cartridges at 7am) and on Sunday you’d wake up to the happy melodies of the Marimba players outside the Café Lulio. A marimba is a traditional instrument similar to the Xylophone but with several people playing it simultaneously.</p>

<p>We did three presentations in Guadalajara plus a workshop about bike travelling in the Casa Ciclista of Guadalajara, in an outdoor shop, open air at the plaza in front of a cathedral and at the Via Recreativa. The latter is an event that takes place every Sunday.</p>

<p>The city would close one of the main roads from 8 am to 2 pm and allow cyclists, skateboarders, inline skaters and walkers to cross the city safely and with fun. There were free rental bikes, Tai Chi introductions, a hula hoop stand, zumba lessons and free bike fixing stations. That’s why Sunday had always been my favorite day in Guadalajara.</p>

<p>Roberto had been living here for nine years and me for eight months. So clearly there were many friends to have a beer with. You can imagine: we spent about two weeks eating and drinking beer with friends.</p>

<p>Our neighborhood had changed a lot and now it was the city’s hipster center. The last time I had seen so many wooden frames for glasses, purple hair, suspenders and hand-knitted gear must have been back in Melbourne. Most cafés offered organic food.</p>
