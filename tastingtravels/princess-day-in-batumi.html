<p>From Pazar we left very early in the morning. We pedaled only a couple of kilometers and we were already in the border. We crossed the immigration police in Turkey with no problem. When we were at the side of Georgia, the first thing that caught our attention was the newly build immigration building. They let us in with our bikes (riding inside the building!) and directly<!--more-->into the passport control. As usual they let me pass with very few struggle, with Roberto it took some time to find out if he as Mexican needed Visa to enter. They checked and re checked his passport.</p>

<p>In the end they let him in. We crossed and the vibe felt different. Quickly images of Christ and other Christian icons decorated the scenery in roads and churches. The Mosques were no more on this part of the wall. The geography was the same. The thing that impacted us the most was the letters. Will will take some time to study the strange alphabet that as our Georgian friend Nina says “looks like <a title="What you probably did not know about Georgia" href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/georgia-in-questions-and-answers/">thrown noodles</a>”.</p>

<p>We then cycled very shortly, about 25 km, and looked for the cheapest most comfortable hotel we could find. We found it. We stayed there for three long days, resting, writing and working on our social media. I got interviewed by a journalist in Mexico who is preparing an article about us in a renowned internet site. We will keep you updated on that.</p>

<p>We had the chance to bond a little with the hotel owners and did some sightseeing, but the city itself was grey and dull because of the weather. It wasn&#8217;t until the third day that the sun revealed its charm. The city of Batumi is beautiful. It has its own cycling path and various beaches were you can relax. After the third day of being by ourselves we booked another day in a hostel, so we could get to meet people. We were eager to make new friends. We did. Nina, Lika, Jerad and Nico (a french cyclist like ourselves). So the next day we packed again and said goodbye to our previous hosts in the Hotel named PHARNAVAZ, a family owned hotel with a balcony and clean as any other five star hotel. In the Hostel we worked a little more, but spent time with the other travelers and the staff. The first day we stayed, Roberto had to fix a couple of broken spokes – again. He is starting to wonder if he is carrying too much baggage. Let&#8217;s hope not. We also visited the botanical garden: A wonder in this place.

<p>Walking from the Himalaya section towards the Mexican section we got to meet a group of Georgians that introduced us to the Georgian Vodka. After a day well spent, we returned home a little drunk and prepared dinner for all of our new friends, tomato pasta and quesadillas with salsa, a complete success.</p>
<p>We were ready to leave the next day but the sun was shining so bright and nice. So Roberto had a wonderful idea: give me my Christmas present. PRINCESS DAY AT BATUMI BEACH!</p>

<p>As Roberto explains: “So we packed a bottle of water, put on our swim suits and headed to the beach, where I was to pamper the love of my life. She had been working so hard the days before, and she had treated me so nice that I was so happy to treat her like the princess she is. So that day I carried all the stuff, gave her a foot massage and did everything she wanted. I then cooked for her Spaghetti Bolognese and had a wonderful day. Late that night she met with all her Red Rock friends in Skype. I was so glad to see her happy.”</p>

<p>Tomorrow we are heading for Tiflis, about 380 km of some complexity and we will wild camp for the first time in this country. I wonder how that would be like.</p>
