<p>Kepala Batas, Malaysia, September 2013</p>
<p>As part of our two year celebration we would like to introduce you to some of the people that have made our bike travel a constant life lesson. These people have opened their hearts to us in ways we cannot even begin to describe. Their contribution to our project is of much value to us so we decided to take this opportunity to make a small homage to them.</p>
<p>We now move on to : Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore</p>
<p>Thanks a lot amigos! Because thanks to you we have strengthened our ties to your beautiful countries and their cultures. Hopefully we will get to see you again!</p>
