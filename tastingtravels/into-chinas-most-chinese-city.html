<p>We rented a tandem bike to get around Xi&#8217;an</p>
<p><strong>A 55 hour&#8217;s bus ride into China&#8217;s most Chinese city</strong></p>
<p><strong>Country</strong>: China<br />
<strong>From</strong> Kashgar to Xi’an<br />
<strong>Days on the bike</strong>: ¼ (plus a day on a tandem)<br />
<strong>Kilometers cycled</strong>: 8<br />
<strong>Average Kilometers per day</strong>: 8<br />
<strong>Total Kilometers cycled till Xi’an</strong>: 7879.66<br />
<strong>Total days travelled till Xi’an</strong>: 446<br />
<strong>Lesson learned</strong>: Honk if you drive against the traffic rules to warn other drivers and stay calm if others do so.<br />
<strong>Laughed about</strong>: The man with the big cheeks that kept yelling at us in Chinese<br />
<strong>Most wonderful miracle</strong>: Cuddling with giant camels<br />
<strong>Food we ate</strong>: All Chinese food I could get<br />
<strong>Greatest obstacle</strong>: Avoiding elbows entering the bus<br />
We stayed in Kashgar for a week and a half always searching for a way to get east. It seemed that all trains east were sold out and the few plane tickets were far too expensive. Cycling was not an alternative because it had taken us easily 1 ½ to 2 months of desert until we would have reached a town where we could renew our visas.<!--more--></p>
<p>In the end Roberto got the two last bus tickets to Xi’an, a town about 4,000 kilometers east. The bikes would not fit in the bus so we rode them to the train station and sent them by train towards Chengdu. The days until the bus left were short. Roberto got a bad cough of all the yellow-brown air (coal ovens everywhere). Our cycling friends Astrid and Gerd were staying in the neighbor hostel and when Gerd also got ill Astrid and I cooked soup and spent the days chatting about our cycling adventures.</p>

<p>Kashgar did not really feel as I had imagined China. In fact I felt just like in any other Central Asian country. Kashgar is situated in China’s biggest province Xinjiang, home to many Uyghur people. The Uyghur are Muslims, they wear Russian fur hats, colorful Uzbek caps or Kyrgyz skin hats and eat what we had been eating so much in Central Asia: mutton.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_0170.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7728" alt="IMG_0170" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_0170.jpg" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_0170.jpg 640w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_0170-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_0170-600x399.jpg 600w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_0170-82x55.jpg 82w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>But there were also a couple of differences: the choice of fruit and vegetables is so big! Back in Sary Tash we had the choice between potatoes and yellow carrots. The street signs were not written in Cyrillic anymore but bilingually in Chinese and Arabic characters. There was smoke everywhere and the town was full of scooters, electro bikes and Rickshaws. I was impressed of the leg-powered Rickshaws (also called Tuktuks). The drivers often drove up to three persons behind their bikes. But most drivers had already gotten a motor to do the hard work.</p>
<p>The traffic was crazy. Back home we use to blow the horn to show other drivers their misbehavior. In China it is just the other way round. Those who ride on the sidewalk on the bike lane, on the wrong side of the street or across a red traffic light just honk their way through the other drivers. And those who drive properly do not seem to mind a bit. Squeezed together with some 25 other scooter and elektro bike drivers we followed the bus in our bike lane through town.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/042.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>We spent the waiting time in the cold Kashgar, visited the<a title="Kashgar Animal Market" href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/kashgar-animal-market/" target="_blank"> animal bazaar</a>, cuddled with yaks and camels and drank as much hot tea as we could get. On Thanksgiving CJ, our friend from the USA was far away from his family. Roberto and I decided to celebrate together. Lee, a Chinese cyclist joined in and so did the night guard of the hostel. The owner sponsored us some tins of beer and master chief Roberto cooked smashed potatoes, a salad and chicken.</p>

<p>The bus ride should take 55 hours, two and a half days. Everybody squeezed towards the bus door in order to get in first. The driver yelled at us to form in a civilized queue. We squeezed together even more and our bubble of people looked more like a drop than like a queue. When the driver opened the door the chaos was perfect. Elbows, bags and shoes were everywhere. I felt like one of the sheep in the Kashgar Animal market. Everybody wanted to get in soon to reserve a good bed. Roberto got us one bed in the aisle and one at the window.</p>

But his face looked so funny when he was angry that we just could not watch him without bursting out in laughter</p></div>
<p>The beds were 1.75 meters long and narrow. Roberto slept in the aisle with two sides to fall out while I got the window bed with a big post in the middle that did not allow me to lay straight properly.<br />
We spent the following days sleeping and being shout at. The three drivers made turns and the one with the big cheeks loved to yell at his passengers. Every time he yelled at us his cheeks wobbled and some food fell out of his mouth. At 2 am he yelled us all out of our dreams and out of his bus and we gathered in a small restaurant to have “dinner”. Just before sunrise we stopped again for a “toilet-break”. Everybody had to get out of the bus (probably so that nobody could steal). In the middle of the desert there was no toilet and all passengers walked a few meters away in order to do their business in the desert. Like moving bushes they sat each some 20 meters away from each other in the desert showing their blank butts to all the others.</p>

<p>Whenever we were not yelled at we watched Chinese and a few English movies. I watched the desert most of the time. After 40 hours I spotted some trees – we have made our way through the desert! It took another 15 hours until we reached Xi’an, known as the “most Chinese city in China”.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_1245.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7741" alt="IMG_1245" src="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_1245.jpg" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_1245.jpg 640w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_1245-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_1245-600x399.jpg 600w, http://www.tastingtravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_1245-82x55.jpg 82w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>The town was beautiful and even had two super modern subway lines, but we badly missed our bikes. Instead we rented a tandem to visit a Buddhist temple, a Taoist temple and a Chinese mosque. <a title="The Terracota Army" href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/terracotta-army/" target="_blank">The terracotta Army</a> and the town’s biggest pagoda were our highlights. And finally we got some real Chinese food. I had been waiting for this moment for so long: cheap Chinese food every day!<br />
After a week of being ordinary tourists we caught a 16 hours train to Chengdu, where our bikes had already been waiting for us. 16 hours – that sounds like a really short ride now.</p>
