<h1>A List of Inspiring Family Bicycle Tourists</h1>
<p><strong>A few days ago on <a title="Twitter / TravellingTwo" href="http://twitter.com/#!/travellingtwo" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, someone asked us which sites to check out for information about bicycle touring with kids. We thought for a few minutes, and then we realised just how many great families are out there pedalling around.</strong></p>
<p>What we really admire about these families is that they&#8217;re not waiting for &#8216;someday&#8217; to travel with their kids. They&#8217;re getting out there and making it happen, despite the often cited idea that once you have kids you have to &#8216;settle down&#8217; and &#8216;be sensible&#8217; &#8211; in a very traditional sort of way.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re looking for some bike touring inspiration for you and your children, look no further than these blogs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" title="Pedal Powered Family" src="https://i0.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/44570-2/FamilyBikeRide-May2010.jpg?resize=250%2C163" alt="Pedal Powered Family" width="250" height="163" data-recalc-dims="1" /><strong>1. <a title="Pedal Powered Family" href="http://www.pedalpoweredfamily.com" target="_blank">Pedal Powered Family</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a title="Pedal Powered Family" href="http://www.pedalpoweredfamily.com" target="_blank"></a></strong>This family is made up of dad Reuben, mom Heidi, 4-year old Eden and 2-year old Harper. They&#8217;ve done a number of shorter tours, and are currently on a 20,000km bicycle tour around North America, Mexico and Central America. They call their trip an &#8216;exercise in adventurous living&#8217; and &#8216;a way of increasing and strengthening the simplicity in our lives&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>What we learned from them: </strong><a title="Cloth diapers for bicycle touring!" href="http://www.pedalpoweredfamily.com/2011/03/babies-diapers-and-traveling-by-bicycle/" target="_blank">You can use cloth diapers</a>, even on a bicycle tour! We checked with the Pedal Powered Family about 3 months into their tour, and they said the cloth diapers were working out great.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" title="Linda, Phil &amp; Luca" src="https://i2.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/46154-2/IMG_5995.JPG?resize=250%2C167" alt="Linda, Phil &amp; Luca" width="250" height="167" data-recalc-dims="1" /><strong>2. </strong><a title="Around The World With Luca" href="http://www.aroundtheworldwithluca.com/" target="_blank">Linda, Phil &amp; Luca</a></p>
<p>In 2010, Linda and Phil took advantage of a 3-year career break from Phil&#8217;s work to embark on a world bike trip with their son Luca. They puttered around Europe for a while, and then flew to Southeast Asia, where Luca has been treated like royalty everywhere they&#8217;ve been.</p>
<p><strong>What we learned from them: </strong>That it&#8217;s possible to <a title="Bike Touring While Pregnant" href="http://www.aroundtheworldwithluca.com/2011/07/hello-highway-1.html" target="_blank">bike tour while you&#8217;re pregnant</a> and that the <a href="http://www.bobike.nl/products/en/bobike_junior+.htm" target="_blank">BoBike Junior</a> seat is one of the few <a title="kids bicycle seat" href="http://www.aroundtheworldwithluca.com/p/equipment.html" target="_blank">bicycle seats for kids that will fit with panniers</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="https://i0.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/40548-2/familyonbikes.JPG?w=250" alt="Family On Bikes" data-recalc-dims="1" /><strong>3. </strong><a title="Family On A Bike" href="http://www.familyonabike.org/" target="_blank">Family Adventure Project</a></p>
<p>Not one or two kids, but three kids! Kirstie and Stuart have been cycling with their growing family since the first one was just 3 months old. They have heaps of <a title="family bicycle trips" href="http://www.familyonabike.org/familyonabike/familyonabikeindex.htm" target="_blank">stories from their family bike trips</a> and <a title="Cycle Toddling" href="http://www.familyonabike.org/stories/Cycle%20Toddling%20Picture/Familyonabike.html" target="_blank">an equipment list</a> for what they call &#8216;Cycle Toddling&#8217; and this summer they&#8217;re <a title="family cycling across Europe" href="http://www.familyadventureproject.org/" target="_blank">cycling across Europe</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What we learned from them: </strong>That you can <a title="Cycle Toddling" href="http://www.familyonabike.org/stories/Cycle%20Toddling/cycle%20toddling.htm" target="_blank">take even a young baby cycling</a> (with a car seat in a trailer), but you might need to modify your routine a bit!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="g2image_float_right alignright" title="Pedouins" src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/42936-2/pedouins.jpg?resize=250%2C214" alt="pedouins" width="250" height="214" data-recalc-dims="1" /><strong>4. <a title="The Pedouins Cycling Family" href="http://www.pedouins.org/" target="_blank">The Pedouins</a></strong></p>
<p>Imagine one bicycle, with mom, dad and 3 daughters! That&#8217;s the Pedouin family, and they&#8217;ve pedalled all the way from their home in Kentucky to Alaska on their <a title="Quint Bicycle" href="http://www.pedouins.org/quint.html" target="_blank">quint bike</a>. It&#8217;s no light rig either, with 5 riders and all their gear!</p>
<p><strong>What we learned from them:</strong> That life on the road has <a href="http://www.pedouins.org/road-lessons.html" target="_blank">lots of lessons for kids</a>; learning isn&#8217;t just for school.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" title="Family On Bikes" src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/38929-2/VogelFamily.jpg?resize=250%2C188" alt="Family On Bikes" width="250" height="188" data-recalc-dims="1" /><strong>5. <a title="Family On Bikes" href="http://www.familyonbikes.org/" target="_blank">Family On Bikes</a></strong></p>
<p>This family, including twin teenage boys, has just finished cycling from Alaska to the southern tip of South America. They&#8217;ve got a host of resources, including <a title="making the decision" href="http://familyonbikes.org/resources/decision.htm" target="_blank">making the decision to go</a>, <a title="homeschooling" href="http://familyonbikes.org/resources/school.htm" target="_blank">homeschooling</a> and what young kids get out of <a title="young kids bicycle touirng" href="http://familyonbikes.org/blog/2011/05/benefits-of-bike-touring-for-small-children/" target="_blank">bicycle touring</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What we learned from them: </strong>That sometimes making the decision to go is scary but <a title="scary but rewarding" href="http://familyonbikes.org/blog/2011/07/why-do-some-people-live-their-dreams-and-others-dont/" target="_blank">it&#8217;s also very rewarding</a>.</p>
