<h1>Chapter 14: The Story Of Louise Sutherland</h1>
<blockquote><p>I was never lonely while I was cycling. I had my bicycle to talk to. &#8211; <span class="s1">Louise Sutherland</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="p4"><strong>You’re coming to the end of our mini book on bike touring but before you go, we’d like to share a story with you.</strong></p>
<p class="p4">It’s written by Hilary Searle of the <a title="CycleSeven" href="http://cycleseven.org" target="_blank">CycleSeven</a> website. She tells the story of Louise Sutherland &#8211; an adventurous bike tourist who went around the world in the 1950s.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7017/6828620747_9049edc1d5.jpg?w=640" alt="Louise Sutherland" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p class="p6">Louise Sutherland was a nurse from New Zealand who was working in London in 1949, when she set off cycling around the world. She bought a bike in a church jumble sale in Soho for £2.10s and a ‘grateful patient’ in the hospital where she was nursing made her a small trailer ‘to trundle merrily behind it.’ She seems to have set off round the world almost on a whim. She had initially only intended to go to Land’s End!</p>
<p class="p4">After that first trip, Louise returned to London to collect her passport and her £50 savings and set off, first for Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. She only returned to London in 1956.</p>
<p class="p4">“During my first day in Italy I felt most dubious about my chances of survival. I had been offered dire warnings about what happened to small girls travelling alone in that country. I did not wish to forego the camping, but equally, I did not relish the thought of being attacked in the dead of night. Of course no one did attack me.”</p>
<p class="p4">The warnings grew even more dire as she approached Yugoslavia: <em>‘They shoot on sight’</em>, <em>‘They’re communists remember. If you’re arrested you might never be heard of again.’ </em>and <em>‘They’re so poor they’ll attack you just to steal the valve rubbers out of your inner tubes’</em>.</p>
<p class="p4">The people, however, treated her with great kindness.</p>
<p class="p4">From Yugoslavia she went to Greece and then took a ferry to Israel. She had an amazingly resilient spirit and refused to be daunted by the fact that having paid the boat fare she had only 13/6d left in the world. In Haifa she took a job in a mission hospital for 3 months, then cycled onto Jordan where she worked as a nanny. From there she cycled to Beirut and spent 6 months working in a sanatorium.</p>
<p class="p4">She had hoped to cycle across the desert to Baghdad but was refused a visa so had to travel by train to catch a boat across the Persian Gulf to India. She was refused a third class ticket, with the line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p4">We do not sell third class tickets to white men and certainly never to a white girl. Anyway no girl is permitted to travel third class alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p4">She had, of course, received many warnings against going to India. In Bombay, she was inundated with offers of hospitality but later found herself in a famine region where she went for 3 days without food.</p>
<p class="p4">“I knew that only by keeping the pedals turning could I ever get to the dense green jungle that would indicate a rain soaked district, and only by reaching such a district would I again get food.”</p>
<p class="p4">Unfortunately all the warnings she had received almost came true when she was attacked by 2 men but they ran away when a bus appeared.</p>
<p class="p4">“The memories of the attack by the few have now blunted and are fading, but the kindness of the many will always remain clear.”</p>
<p class="p4">“After the fear had completely left my mind, I could feel nothing but anger for those two men. They had placed me in a position where all the world could say: ‘I told you so!’ but does one swallow make a summer?”</p>
