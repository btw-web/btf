<p>It could be a small region or a whole continent. The size or location doesn&#8217;t matter so much but what makes the difference is that the people answering the questions are passionate about the destination they choose to share with us.</p>
<p>Some choose to go back to their destination several times. Others vow never to repeat the experience, yet cherish it as one of their best cycling trips.</p>
