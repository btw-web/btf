<p>Here are just a few of the recipes we made on our bicycle trip. They&#8217;re all easy and quick to make, with basic ingredients you should find just about anywhere. </p>
<p>Our focus is on food that is tasty, cheap and free of unwanted extras like preservatives, chemicals and flavourings.</p>

As long as you have a small non-stick frying pan, there&#8217;s no reason you can&#8217;t make them on the road for a tasty and cheap vegetarian supper. This recipe is for a mediterranean version of piklets but you could try endless variations. 5 large tomatoes, diced 1 cup  <a class="read-more" href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/recipes/piklets">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p></div><div class="half-right"><h4 class="link" id="post-10032"><a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/recipes/fresh-mango-avocado-salsa">Fresh Mango &#038; Avocado Salsa</a></h4><div class="post-thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6123/6043141914_146c418ee0.jpg?resize=75%2C75" alt="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/recipes/fresh-mango-avocado-salsa" /></div><p>If you can get mangos and avocados in the markets or supermarkets where you&#8217;re touring, then you can definitely make this easy and refreshing salsa.

They make a great rest-day breakfast when you have plenty of time in the morning, or try them for supper. On a shorter tour, you can, mix the dry ingredients at home before you leave.

Buffalo mozzarella is so cheap there, it&#8217;s a shame not to take advantage and here&#8217;s a very simple way to enjoy it, with a traditional Caprese Salad.
