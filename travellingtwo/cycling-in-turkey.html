<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>In this guest post, <a title="Tasting Travels" href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/" target="_blank" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">Roberto Gallegos</a> shares his experience of bike touring in Turkey: a wonderful country full of good food, beautiful roads and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; wonderful people. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>He recently cycled there along with his partner Annika, as part of their extended world bike tour.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong></strong>***</p>
<p>Cycling in Turkey, as you may already have read on this blog, is a pleasant experience for the touring cyclist. Here are our experiences with the 5 most important things I think cyclists need to know about when visiting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/cycling-in-turkey#visas">Visas</a></li>
<li><a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/cycling-in-turkey#roads">Roads</a></li>
<li><a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/cycling-in-turkey#landscape">A Beautiful Landscape</a><a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/cycling-in-turkey#roads"> </a></li>

<li><a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/cycling-in-turkey#people">The People</a></li>
</ul>
<p>By now, you&#8217;re probably thinking: what about money and costs? Yes, I&#8217;ll cover that too within each topic because it&#8217;s also an item of some importance.</p>
<p><a name="visas"></a>My goal is to prepare you and make you excited to cycle in one of the world&#8217;s fastest developing countries. In every major city and along the main roads, there&#8217;s one construction site after another. This was our route:</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/48612-2/Our+Route.jpg?w=500" alt="Route across Turkey" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Now, without further delay, let&#8217;s get to the good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Visas<br />
</strong>I&#8217;m a proud Mexican and travel with my significant-other Annika, who is German. That makes it fun in all sorts of ways. We get to research visa requirements for two countries instead of one. Briefly: German nationals (along with most European countries) get a free 90-day visa for Turkey. The Mexicans (along with our neighboring U.S citizens) are entitled to the same 90-day visa with a small difference: we pay a petty €15 for it.</p>
<p><a name="roads"></a>This information may not be new to you, but the following will be: On February 1st, 2012 a new immigration law came into place. It restricts tourists coming from Europe and (as far as I know) Mexico to a maximum 90-day stay within a period of 180 days. This is a great difference from before when you could renew your visa every 90 days and stay for an indefinite amount of time. This means that <a title="Visa renewal" href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/greek-afternoon-the-visa-travel/" target="_blank">you can&#8217;t get a boat to the Greek islands</a> and get re-stamped for an extension of your visa. Sadly, you only have three months to cycle in Turkey. The good news is that 3 months is plenty of time to fall in love, as I did.</p>
<p><strong>Roads<br />
</strong>Our trip began at the end of March. Our plan was to cross the 1,620km from Fethiye to the northeast border town of Sarp. Turkey is a hilly country. Turkish people will insist that the center is flat but this is not true! Our first task was to climb from sea level up and over a 1,400 meter mountain peak, in order to access the central plain.</p>
<p>Overall the roads in Turkey are good to cycle, but there is still much place for improvement. Some sections have long and hard 10% grades. There can also be a lot of traffic. Be prepared for constant honking, especially when you are climbing. On main roads, the shoulders are wide enough for two cyclists to bike alongside one another. The signs are clear and accurate. You will know when you have reached the highest point of your climb.</p>
<p><a name="landscape"></a>Along the road, you will find <a title="local bike shops turkey" href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/one-day-in-the-life-of-tarkan/" target="_blank">local bike shops equipped with basic parts</a> in almost every town. In some cities we found good bike shops with expert mechanics: Fethiye, Köyceğiz and Ankara.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/48604-2/Tarkan+Biciclet.JPG?w=500" alt="Bike SHops" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>Photo by Roberto Gallegos, website: <a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/">Tasting Travels</a></small></p>
<p>Another big plus on the roads of Turkey, is that you will find fresh water springs along the roads. Water from these little oases of freshness is potable and never caused harm to our health.</p>
<p><strong>A Favourite Landscape</strong><br />
Of all the places we cycled, we highly recommend the Afyon Valley (just behind Afyonkarahisar on the way to Ankara). You will cycle along interesting rock formations, very similar to the touristy Cappadocia. You will be able to stop once in a while to climb them and &#8211; if you are into photography &#8211; the golden hour in this valley is superb for landscape pics. The views from the high points are splendid.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/48609-2/On+our+way+to+Ankara.JPG?w=640" alt="On The Way To Ankara" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>Photo by Roberto Gallegos, website: <a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/">Tasting Travels</a></small></p>
<p><a name="sleep"></a>Along the so called Green Mile the fields of chai (Turkish tea) will trigger joy in your pedaling. You will be invited numerous amount of times for Turkish tea and soft drinks, especially in summer when the sun shines and the rain refreshes the day. The road is very easy to ride. The wind might be a factor but should not be a big problem.</p>
<p><strong>Places to Sleep<br />
</strong>It all depends on you and your budget and what you are looking for. Lucky you &#8211; we have tried them all! Cheap hotels range from 35-70 TL (about €16-35). At the top of that range you can have a room with internet and satellite TV.</p>
<p>Wild camping should be done discreetly, if you really want to be alone. On the other hand, if you enjoy meeting new people and sleeping indoors just put your tent in a visible place or ask if you can camp in a field. There is a big possibility that people will come and invite you for tea and food, or ask you to stay in their home.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/48617-2/Great+Morning+pic+in+Central+Turkey.JPG?w=640" alt="camping spot" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
<small>Photo by Roberto Gallegos, website: <a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/">Tasting Travels</a></small></p>
<blockquote><p>A great example of the experiences that are bound to happen to you is this one of ours: We stopped for water at a rest area along the Afyon Valley. A pair of truck drivers invited us for breakfast. Ömer, a thin happy man with grey hair and a mullet asked us with hands and feet our destination. We told him we were headed towards the Black Sea. With a finger on the map, he pointed to his home in Pazar. He then wrote down his telephone number and drew a house in the paper. He was inviting us to stay at his house for the night. We had 600 km to go and we already had a local waiting for us. How cool was that? We arrived 5 weeks later and we spent two incredible days in Ömers house up in the mountains of his hometown. We were even invited to participate in his friends reunion and although Annika was the only woman in the party they all behaved like gentleman.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you, for some uncomprehended reason, want to keep out from the experience of sleeping in a stranger’s house, there is another great option. Gas Stations or Petrol Stations in Turkey are your answer. They will all welcome you with arms wide open. Gas Stations are like the hostels of travel bikers, you have a place to sleep with toilet, security and in some cases even shower. Do not hesitate to ask, all the bike travelers we met on the way had the same experiences as we did.</p>
<p><a name="food"></a>And lastly, if hospitality in this country is superb and you have to work your way to avoid being invited, wild camping could be your last option and a really safe one. If you have ever been hesitant about the idea to sleep in the road or in the wild, Turkey should be the perfect place to gain confidence and end any misconceptions you might have about this idea.</p>
<p><strong>The Food</strong><br />
Although Turkish food might not be as well recognised as French or Mexican, its glorious flavor is another reason why cycling here is so advisable. There is more than the famous çorba (soup) in their diet. <a title="food" href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/deliciuos-turkey/" target="_blank">We tried so many dishes</a> that we could eat for 6 months without repeating them all at once and we were often invited into people&#8217;s homes..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/48601-2/The+Food.JPG?w=640" alt="The Food" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>Photo by Roberto Gallegos, website: <a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/">Tasting Travels</a></small></p>
<p>When you are not invited, here is the price range per person:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gas station restaurant (expensive) &#8211; 15 TL (€6) per person (including a drink)</li>
<li>City fast food joint &#8211;  2 TL (€0.80) for a Gözleme (pancake) to 3.50 TL (€1.40) for a Döner.</li>
<li>Self-serve restaurants &#8211; from 5.50 TL (€2.30) with bread and all the water you can drink.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="people"></a>Usually free tea is served after a meal. Beef is very expensive and it is considered a luxury so if you want to save some money go for the chicken or the fish. Beer can be bought but it is very expensive:  3.50 TL (€1.40) for half a liter.</p>
<p>In brief, you can have three substantial meals a day including chicken for around 18 TL a day (€7).</p>
<p><strong>The People</strong><br />
The best reason why cycling in Turkey is a wonderful experience is certainly <a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/hosgeldiniz-please-take-a-seat/" target="_blank">the people</a>. After Turkey we were injected with so much faith in people. We now feel that nothing in the world can stop us from cycling around the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/48597-2/They+picjked+us+up+from+the+road+to+their+house.JPG?w=640" alt="Kind people of Turkey" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <small>Photo by Roberto Gallegos, website: <a href="http://www.tastingtravels.com/">Tasting Travels</a></small></p>
<p>The only reason it took us so much time to cross the country (five months for not even 2,000 km) was the people: the ones who offered us shelter, helped us when we seemed lost or helpless, offered us tea or simply were kind to us in every possible human way. Another great asset about this country is the fast responses you get on <a title="Couchsurfing" href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/" target="_blank">Couchsurfing</a>. There is always someone willing to host you. Through this magnificent tool of humanity we have made so many friends in Turkey we consider this country another home in our planet.</p>
<p>So cyclist friend, if you have the chance to cycle along this rich and historically important land of our mother earth – do so. You will have an experience of your life. There is much more detailed information about the route that we took, If you are in need of this information please contact us. We will be happy to help and keep you updated with what we know.</p>
