<h1>Heinz Stücke: Bike Touring Since 1962 And Still Going Strong</h1>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="g2image_float_right" title="Heinz Stucke © www.viajar24h.com from flickr" src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/42934-2/heinzstucke_001.jpg?resize=168%2C250" alt="heinzstucke" width="168" height="250" data-recalc-dims="1" />He&#8217;s cycled a massive 600,000km by bicycle over the last half century – enough to go around the world 15 times</strong>.</p>
<p>Along the way he&#8217;s been attacked by bees, shot at by rebels and hit by cars. He ran out of water in the Sahara Desert and had his bike stolen 6 times. Every time he got it back.</p>
<p>Now, 70 years old and still touring on the same bike he started with, Heinz Stücke could be forgiven for slowing down a bit. Not at all. This world nomad is still going strong. In fact, he&#8217;s cycling more than ever. All of his last 10 years have made it into his &#8216;top 20&#8217; in terms of distance. Sometimes he rides for up to 16 hours a day. And in 2008, Stücke covered 22,000km – his biggest year yet.</p>
<p>“The reason is that I like more and more those lonely stretches in the desert and in the forest so I can do more cycling. In the olden days it was like more living: going into the city, staying 3-4 weeks, participating in the culture of the country, which is also interesting. But as I&#8217;m getting older somehow it seems more a daily rhythm of progress, of camping, of independence, of nobody bothering you,” he says.</p>
<p>If Stücke&#8217;s style has changed over the decades, two things haven&#8217;t: he still rides the same 3-speed bike he started out with (although he sometimes uses folding bikes for convenience) and his passion for cycling is still firmly intact. There are no plans for the world&#8217;s longest bike tour to stop anytime soon.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="g2image_float_right" title="Heinz Stucke © www.viajar24h.com from flickr" src="https://i2.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/42932-2/1447662067_6296002717.jpg?resize=250%2C167" alt="1447662067_6296002717" width="250" height="167" data-recalc-dims="1" />“I have found my Shangri-la,” he says, brushing aside the suggestion that he take even a little time away from cycling to write a book. There are still too many parts of the world left to explore.</p>
<p>“While my legs hold out and while there are new places, and there seems to be always new places, it doesn&#8217;t matter how old and long I travel&#8230;”</p>
<p>Stücke never finishes the sentence. Instead, his mind jumps to the most recent places he visited in Japan and the adventures yet to come: Canada&#8217;s north this summer and, if he can raise the money, the remaining far-flung islands needed to complete his quest to visit every country in the world.</p>
<p>Money may not be exactly easy to come by but it&#8217;s certainly easier for Stücke now than when he  started. He spent his first years scraping by on as little as 50 cents a day and has even resorted to fixing his own teeth with superglue, rather than go to the dentist.</p>
<p>“It was shoestring travel in the first 20 years. You don&#8217;t spend any money. You just wait until somebody invites you and then you eat like a camel. You eat 3 kilograms of meat so for the next 3 days you don&#8217;t need to eat. It was always like that and no transport was ever paid for.”</p>
<p>“Now I have a bit of a name and money suddenly comes from all kinds of sources and I can even play a bit of a rich guy. I even sponsor other cyclists a little bit because I feel I had such a hard time in the beginning and people gave me so much all the time that it&#8217;s about time to give something back.”</p>
