<h1>What are the roads like for cyclists in New Zealand?</h1>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="g2image_float_right" title="The desolate roads on the Central Plateau" src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/36470-2/DSC_7950.JPG?resize=250%2C168" alt="The desolate roads on the Central Plateau" width="250" height="168" data-recalc-dims="1" />The roads of New Zealand are a mixed bag for cyclists</strong>.  Despite its beautiful landscape, the country doesn&#8217;t have the best reputation for caring drivers or good roads.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t expect to find a paved shoulder. Sometimes it will be there but often it won&#8217;t be. Prepare as well for fast-flowing traffic (especially on the North Island), logging trucks and ignorant motorists who may yell at you or pass too closely. <strong>A mirror is invaluable</strong> and don&#8217;t even think about cycling while listening to music on your iPod.</p>
<p>That said, you shouldn&#8217;t be put off your trip to New Zealand. There is some good news: in more remote areas, you can ride through fantastic scenery, meet wonderful people and hardly see a car all day.</p>
<p>A successful bike trip to New Zealand is all about picking the spots where you plan to go.</p>
<p>Many of the best bike routes are on <strong>dirt roads (or metal roads as the Kiwi&#8217;s call them) </strong>with few services around, so we recommend come equipped with fat tyres and plenty of camping gear. Bring a racing bike and you&#8217;ll be limited to main roads for sure. Taking <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/newzealand/buses">buses</a> and trains around the less appealing bits is another good idea.</p>
<p>If you can, <strong>come outside the peak seasons of Christmas and Easter</strong>, when every Kiwi family will be on the move, adding to an already booming tourist industry. And pick up some <strong>detailed maps</strong> that will let you use local roads to their full potential.</p>
<p>The AA publishes excellent maps and Kiwi members can get them for free so if you have a friend in New Zealand, see if they&#8217;ll order some for you or just ask around once you&#8217;re here. Many families have bucketloads of AA maps sitting in their closets.</p>
<p><strong>SOUTH VS. NORTH<br />
</strong>On the whole, the <strong>South Island</strong> offers far better cycling than the North Island. Its light population base (just 1/4 of the country lives here) means traffic is rarely heavy here, unless you&#8217;re coming into the big cities Christchurch and Dunedin. Even then it&#8217;s possible to get in on two wheels without too much stress.</p>
<p>The heaviest traffic tends to be around the edges of the South Island, particularly on the East Coast from Dunedin all the way to Picton and on the key cross-island routes like Highway 7 between Christchurch and Greymouth, where you should be  prepared to share the road with every local resident, logging truck and tourist in a camper van for miles around.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s much harder to get away from traffic on the <strong>North Island</strong>. The Coromandel Peninsula is nice if it isn&#8217;t peak holiday time. We can also recommend the Tongariro National Park, the Wairarapa between Napier and Wellington and the Whanganui River Road, not far from the city of Wanganui.</p>
<p>Cycling into the big cities of Wellington and Auckland isn&#8217;t a good idea unless you like motorways.</p>
