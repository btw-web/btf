<h1>One Tough Bag: The Laptop Sleeve From WaterField Designs</h1>
<p><strong>A round-the-world bike tour is a good way to test any piece of gear, and </strong><strong>the laptop case we bought from <a title="SFBags" href="http://www.sfbags.com/products/sleevecases/sleevecases.php" target="_blank">WaterField Designs</a> (SFBags.com) was </strong><strong>one of the things that stood up best to our 3-year trip.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The short version of this review is that we heartily recommend these cases as a great way to protect your gadgets from dust and bumps on the road.</p>
<p>Although this post focuses mostly on the laptop cases, WaterField also has bags for iPads, Kindles and cameras, customized to fit many different models.</p>
<p>Our first experience with this company was way back in 2006, when we bought a case for our small netbook. The laptop sleeve is still going strong. It was pulled in and out of bicycle panniers on a daily basis and thrown carelessly around our tent but aside from a few minor scuff marks, you can hardly tell the difference between the old one (on the right) and the new one we just bought last month for another laptop.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/travelling_two/6177422438/"><img loading="lazy" title="Old and New Laptop Cases (Waterfield Designs)" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6166/6177422438_09728f6b22.jpg?resize=500%2C319" alt="Old and New Laptop Cases (Waterfield Designs)" width="500" height="319" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>When you see the bags in person, this isn&#8217;t surprising. It&#8217;s very clear that this is a high quality product. The outer nylon fabric is durable enough to stand up to daily bumps and scrapes and there&#8217;s a good bit of padding inside as well. There&#8217;s no need to worry about this bag scratching anything you might put in it, and because the bags are custom made to fit your laptop, they wrap snuggly around the computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/travelling_two/6176898507/"><img loading="lazy" title="Laptop Case (Waterfield Designs)" src="https://i1.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6176898507_557fbf2f63.jpg?resize=500%2C289" alt="Laptop Case (Waterfield Designs)" width="500" height="289" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Velcro keeps the bag sealed. You can choose either a simple velcro strap, which keeps your laptop from sliding out but leaves the top mostly open, or a flap that completely covers the top of the case.</p>

<p>On the back, there&#8217;s a sleeve that&#8217;s big enough to fit a few papers or a power cord, and at the bottom is a little loop that you can slip your finger through, so you always have a good grip on the bag. You can also order a strap, if you like, though for a bike tour it&#8217;s probably not necessary.</p>

<p>After buying our first laptop bag, we purchased more things from WaterField. These included a gear bag, to hold things like batteries and power cords during our world trip, and most recently a <a title="Kindle Case" href="http://www.sfbags.com/products/kindle/kindle-cases.php" target="_blank">Kindle case</a> for our Kindle eReader (see our <a title="Kindle review" href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/kindle-bike-touring">review on the Kindle for bike touring</a>).</p>

<p>The customer service has always been great, and the bags have always arrived in just a few days, despite needing to be shipped halfway around the world, from San Francisco to our home in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Overall, we couldn&#8217;t be happier with the bags we&#8217;ve purchased from WaterField. We&#8217;re fully aware this review sounds a bit too much like gushing, but this is one product that we really happen to like and have no problems recommending.</p>
<p>Yes, the bags are a bit more expensive than others on the market, but the quality is far better than other bags we&#8217;ve seen. WaterField also offer a greater range of sizes than most shops, so you&#8217;re almost guaranteed to find a bag that will fit your gadget perfectly.</p>
