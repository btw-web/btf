<h1>Tips &#038; Tricks From 20 Years Of South American Bike Touring</h1>

<p>In this interview, Gareth shares his experiences and memories of travelling by bicycle in South America. You&#8217;ll find more bike touring tips and tricks on his website,  <a title="El Pedalero" href="http://elpedalero.com/" target="_blank">El Pedalero</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1. You describe Latin America as &#8220;the world’s greatest adventure travel destination&#8221;. That&#8217;s a big claim. Why do you think it&#8217;s true?</strong></p>
<p>Good question! It is a big claim, yes, and not one I make lightly.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the geography. Latin America has the planet’s longest mountain range, largest jungle, driest desert, biggest salt flat, widest street, highest waterfall, tallest volcano, and longest road. That&#8217;s quite a playground for an adventure cyclist.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s the abundance of animal and plant life. On the list of the countries with the highest biodiversity in the world, Latin America has six in the top ten! Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Ecuador, and Venezuela, with Brazil at number one (surprise, surprise).</p>
<p>Latin America is also a place of mystery and intrigue. Wherever you travel, you&#8217;re never far from the ruins of some lost, ancient culture. Tikal, Palenque, and Machu Picchu are all worth visiting, although I prefer the lesser-known, harder-to-reach sites such as Yaxchilán (Mexico), Kuélap (Peru), and my favourite, Ciudad Perdida (Colombia).</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s everything else: the food, the music, the colonial architecture, the leafy plazas, the hidden beaches, the native traditions, the bustling markets, the crowded streets, and the lonely highways.</p>
<p>But most of all, what makes Latin America great is Latin Americans. I&#8217;ve lost track of how many times I’ve been invited to dinners, put up at people&#8217;s houses, given lifts when I&#8217;ve been stuck somewhere, and otherwise helped out by friendly, generous, warm-hearted Latinos from all corners of the continent.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever be finished exploring Latin America.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Making Friends, Oaxaca City, Mexico by elpedalero, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pedalero/7161803484/"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7211/7161803484_b3e50a7270_z.jpg?w=640" alt="Making Friends, Oaxaca City, Mexico" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />

<p><strong>2. It&#8217;s such a huge area and not everyone has years to explore it. If you could recommend just one or two areas to focus on, what would they be?</strong></p>
<p>This is a very difficult question to answer. On the one hand, whichever place you choose, it&#8217;s going to be fantastic. On the other hand, you&#8217;ll be missing out on a hundred places just as remarkable. Here&#8217;s a solution: Get a pad of Post-its. On each square of paper write one place from this list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Argentine Patagonia</li>
<li>The Central Andean Altiplano</li>
<li>The Chilean Lake District</li>
<li>The Mexican Colonial Heartland</li>
<li>Central America</li>
<li>The Yucatán</li>
<li>The Amazon</li>
<li>The Gran Sabana</li>
<li>Western Cuba</li>
<li>The Chaco</li>
<li>The River Plate</li>
<li>Southern Brazil</li>
</ul>
<p>Now stick the Post-its all over a wall and throw a dart at it. Whichever Post-it the dart lands on, that&#8217;s the area you&#8217;ll focus on. The entire continent is amazing and you have to start somewhere, so just start riding.</p>

<p><strong>3. How about a country that&#8217;s often overlooked (but shouldn&#8217;t be) by most bike tourists?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tie between Venezuela and Paraguay.</p>
<p>Cyclists skip El Salvador because they think it&#8217;s too small to be interesting (not true). And they skip Colombia because they think it&#8217;s too dangerous (also not true). But they skip Venezuela and Paraguay for no real reason at all, which is a shame because they contain landscapes unlike any other in the world.</p>
<p>Venezuela has the Gran Sabana, the Llanos, the Orinoco Delta, the world&#8217;s highest waterfall, and the Caribbean&#8217;s longest coastline. It claims the starting point of the Andes and the headwaters of both of the Orinoco and the Amazon rivers (the Casiquiare Bifurcation).</p>
<p>Paraguay has the Chaco Seco, the Chaco Húmedo, Cerro Memby, Saltos del Monday, Jesuit ruins, and friendly Mennonite communities who are incredibly generous toward travelling cyclists. And the wildlife here will amaze you – Paraguay is the only place I&#8217;ve ever seen a wild jaguar while cycling!</p>
<p>Both countries still have all the colonial charm, delicious coffee, unmonitored children, and subtlety-free television programming you&#8217;ve come to expect from any self-respecting Latin American nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Red Soils And Green Grass On The Gran Sabana by elpedalero, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pedalero/8272081997/"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8272081997_7de8ae0f42_z.jpg?w=640" alt="Red Soils And Green Grass On The Gran Sabana" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />

<p><strong>4. Is there anything in particular that bike tourists should pack for a trip to Latin America that they might not normally have in their bags?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Spanish! It&#8217;s compact, it&#8217;s lightweight, and it won&#8217;t take up any room in your panniers.</p>
<p>Seriously, a good working knowledge of Spanish will get you out of more jams than your multi-tool, your first aid kit, and that notarized photocopy of your passport combined.</p>
<p>Until you start speaking and understanding Spanish, you&#8217;re missing out on the real Latin American experience. And you&#8217;re missing out on making lifelong friendships with some of the most generous and warm-hearted people on the planet.</p>
<p>And once you&#8217;ve got Spanish, it&#8217;s a lot easier to understand and start learning Portuguese for your trip through Brazil.</p>

<p><strong>5. Mental preparation is also important for a bike tour. What are some typical South American challenges that cyclists need to be prepared for?</strong></p>
<p>Garbage! Garbage in the streets, garbage in the rivers, garbage in the forests, the deserts, the beaches. It&#8217;s not like this everywhere, obviously, but it&#8217;s certainly going to be something you&#8217;ll see plenty of on your travels in Latin America.</p>
<p>Noise! Screeching engines, screaming children, blaring loudspeakers mounted atop moving vehicles. And, of course, the music. I love music, but not 120 decibels of pumping reggaetón at 4:00 am from a car stereo parked outside the window of my hotel room!</p>
<p>Dogs! Not all dogs. Just the ones that roam the countryside looking for bikes to chase and ankles to bite.</p>
<p>Bugs! Not the big, ugly ones, but the small, swarming ones: the mosquitoes, the tábanos, the coliguachos, the jejénes, and of course all the microscopic, water-borne invaders.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Unexpected Companion, Bolivia by elpedalero, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pedalero/6915694478/"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7210/6915694478_134b56933c_z.jpg?w=640" alt="Unexpected Companion, Bolivia" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />

<p><strong>6. Where will your next tour in Latin America be, or have you explored it all by now?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever be finished exploring Latin America. I may have toured through every country, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ve seen it all. There are so many hidden corners and mysterious landscapes still to see. My next tour will be several years long and will focus on discovering these places for myself. Right now, I&#8217;m researching areas within Northern Mexico, south-western Brazil, central Chile, and Colombia&#8217;s Pacific lowlands. But as usual, I&#8217;ll be winging it once I&#8217;m there, making it up as I go.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be revisiting some old haunts. It&#8217;s been so long since I first travelled in some of these areas it&#8217;ll be like visiting them for the first time. For example, many of the horrendously-rough gravel roads I cycled in Patagonia back in the 1990s have now been paved. It&#8217;ll be a treat to ride these roads while enjoying the scenery instead of staring at the gravel in front of my wheel, trying to pick the best line!</p>
