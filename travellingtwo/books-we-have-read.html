<h1>Books We Have Read</h1>
<p>One of the great things about this trip is we finally have the time to read again. Here are the books we&#8217;ve devoured so far, although don&#8217;t read too much into our choice of novels. We read anything that falls into our hands en route.</p>

<li><span class="side"><a href="http://www.joyfielding.com/books/see-jane-run.html" target="_blank">See Jane Run by Joy Fielding</a> &#8212; A surprisingly good read about a woman who has amnesia and then tries to figure out the mystery of her life. It kept me glued to the last page. </span></li>
