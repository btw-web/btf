<h1>Road To Recovery: Bike Touring After A Back Injury</h1>
<p><strong>Emil is <a href="http://www.thebigtrip.se/" target="_blank">going on a bike tour</a> from his home in Sweden to Beijing, China. Hundreds of other cyclists will make similar journeys this year, but Emil&#8217;s is special because in 2009 he couldn&#8217;t walk.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/46977-1/bigtrip1.jpg?w=640" alt="Emil On His Bicycle" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>He was injured in a serious skiing accident and had to go through a painful recovery just to learn how to walk again, let alone ride a bicycle. Now &#8211; after a lot of medical treatment &#8211; Emil is much better but still suffers some back pain.</p>
<p>In this interview, Emil tells us how he stayed motivated through a long recovery and how he deals with back pain while cycling.</p>
<p><strong>1. You had a very long rehabilitation. How did you keep your hopes and motivation up during that time?</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/46982-2/bigtrip2.jpg?resize=250%2C333" alt="Emil's back injury" width="250" height="333" data-recalc-dims="1" />One year before my accident, I was dreaming of doing a world bicycle tour. The moment I woke up after the operation I had only one thing in my mind: to fulfill my dream no matter what it would take.</p>
<p>As I could not walk, I planned on changing my transportation from bicycle to a wheelchair. With my will set and a very clear goal ahead I slowly became stronger and the medical personnel were surprised about my fast rehabilitation. After weeks I started to walk with the help of a “walk table” and after months I used crutches.</p>
<p>After 5 months I sat on my bike again and made a 500 meter tour. It was the most painful ride of my life and I almost thought to myself &#8216;How in the world am I going to bicycle across the world?&#8217; but I didn’t.</p>
<p>Instead I was happy about the small improvements and after a dozens of shorter trips I bicycled 80 km during one day.</p>
<p><strong>2. Now that you&#8217;ve largely recovered, you&#8217;re planning a big trip. Can you tell us about it?</strong></p>
<p>My plans have taken shape and on the 20th of March this year I will start my trip from Stockholm, Sweden heading for Beijing, China. With my background and all I have gone through I have decided to raise money for disabled kids and young people. I will be taking it easy, trying not to cover more than 60-70 km a day. My main focus is to overcome my weaknesses and try to inspire others to aim towards their own goals.</p>
<p><strong>3. You&#8217;re still suffering some back pain, however. How will you deal with that during a bike tour?</strong></p>
<p>Well the trip is going to be tough, very tough. My legs aren’t what they used to be and my back is messed up in all sorts of ways.</p>
<p>I have learned to always use pain as a motivation. During periods of pain, days when everything goes wrong, I will use the same motivation as during my rehabilitation. I will look forward and find happiness in the small improvements.</p>
<p>Pain is like an allergy. It&#8217;s a result of your body’s reaction to a foreign substance. I can not control the cause of my pain but the spreading and the feeling of it is very much based on my motivation and how I encounter it. If I am afraid of being in pain it will grow stronger and feed on that very fear. If I let pain decide whether I am going to bicycle or not, I am not in possession of my own will and if that happens life is worth nothing.</p>

<p><strong>4. Are there exercises you do, that other cyclists with back pain might also be able to benefit from?</strong></p>
<p>I would gladly recommend yoga. There are of course millions of different forms and exercises but going to some classes and learning the basic postures is very helpful. I always, except in pouring rain, do some yoga during lunches and longer breaks.</p>
<p>What you really are looking for is creating circulation. Pain is often caused by body products being left in you muscles and by creating blood flow you will flush out a lot of these. You can also achieve this by heating the painful area. I always carry a warm water bottle and fill it with some boiling water from my camp kitchen. It’s great when crawling into your sleeping bag!</p>
<p>A TENS machine might also do some good. It’s practically a device that emits small electric charges into the painful area. I am no scientist but the easy explanation is that these electric signals overcharge the body’s sensory cells and thus blinding your nerve system from the pain. You can buy a TENS machine almost anywhere. Make sure it’s low-weight and powered by batteries.</p>
<p><strong>5. Does your back pain mean you will have to stop camping? Getting in and out of the tent and crouching around a campfire can&#8217;t be good for your back.</strong></p>
<p>I would never stop camping. Haha. It’s too fun. Doing fun stuff often makes my mind forget about pain for a while. I have invested in a much thicker sleeping mattress and will of course use hostels a bit more than I had planned on doing before my accident. It is always nice with a warm and soft bed once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>6. What advice do you have for other cyclists suffering from back pain?<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take it easy. Don’t panic if your average bicycle day ends in 30-50 km. It’s really better than not bicycling at all.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid of hitching a ride, you can always persuade someone by pointing at your aching back (or even better, a scar).</li>
<li>Move around on the saddle and use a lot of different riding positions. Try to involve different muscles all the time, thus not creating tension in a specific muscle.</li>
<li>Take breaks often and try to do some yoga</li>
</ul>
