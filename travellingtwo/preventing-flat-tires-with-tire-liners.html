<h1>Preventing Flat Tires With Tire Liners</h1>

<p>Eric &amp; Elaine Hendrickson have traditionally had a lot of flat tires, but they recently found a solution that&#8217;s put their flat tire woes to a stop: <a title="Mr. Tuffy" href="http://mrtuffy.com/" target="_blank">Mr. Tuffy</a> tire liners. After a difficult trip on rough tracks across Newfoundland and Labrador, Eric sent us an email to tell us about their experience with the liners:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;We had just touched down at mile zero in St John’s, the capital city of Newfoundland, and were making a side trip to Cape Spear where we met our first distance biker of the trip.  He was a cross-Canada biker that had just come from mile zero to finish his trip.  As cyclists do, we started comparing notes about our trips.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;His was fast road trip (average 225 km per day) while ours was a slow off road trip (averaging 65 km per day.)  We then compared things we had with us but never used, and we both still had all of our spare tubes still in the boxes.  He had done just over 7,000 km on road while we had done just under 3,000 km of mostly dirt and gravel roads.  Finally, we compared past trips and we both discovered we had many flats. Last summer we averaged 157 km per flat. In our discussion, we realized we had both switched to racing tubes and <a title="Mr. Tuffy" href="http://mrtuffy.com/" target="_blank">Mr. Tuffy</a> tire liners.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://i0.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/47651-2/Eric.JPG?resize=300%2C225" alt="Rough Roads Across Newfoundland" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;We rode many miles of rough road on our journey across Newfoundland and Labrador, including shale, broken glass and metal. Not once did we get a flat.  Mid-way through the trip I had to change a tire as it was worn to the point I had little traction.  When I removed the tire, I found several small pieces of broken glass in the liner. I just wiped it clean with a rag and put it inside the new tire, re-installed the old tube and continued on our way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;We returned home with the same two new tubes that we had started the trip with earlier.  According to my wife it was the best investment made for the trip, and I would have to agree.  The tire liners come in a variety of sizes and types, and are easy to install.  We selected ours based on trying to maintain a tire weight that was about the same. We got rid of the heavy-duty inner tubes and used light-weight tubes instead, so there was little weight change.&#8221;</p>
