<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="g2image_float_right" title="Taking breaks is essential to stay well rested and healthy" src="https://i0.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/37762-2/DSC_9680.JPG?resize=250%2C168" alt="Andrew lunching at the beach" width="250" height="168" data-recalc-dims="1" />You want to stay as fit as possible on tour &#8211; who really wants to waste precious holiday time going to a hospital or lingering in a hotel room?</strong></p>
<p>Happily the very act of being on your bike will probably boost your system to new highs. All that adrenaline running through your system and the positive effects of being outside and active go a long way towards general well being.</p>
<p>That said, a bit of forethought can go a long way to keeping you in good shape while cycle touring. And of course don&#8217;t forget to drink lots of water, take regular breaks and eat well to compensate for all the work you&#8217;re doing.</p>
