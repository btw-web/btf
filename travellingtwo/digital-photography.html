<h1>Picking Out A Camera For Bike Touring</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="g2image_float_right" title="Nikon D80 SLR" src="https://i0.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/33398-2/NikonD80.jpg?resize=250%2C250" alt="Nikon D80 SLR" width="250" height="250" data-recalc-dims="1" /><strong>Even the most gadget-adverse bike tourist is likely to carry a digital camera.</strong></p>
<p>After all, when you finally round the last switchback to reach that glorious mountain peak, you&#8217;ll want a photo to remember the moment! A digital camera also allows you to create a small income stream by <a title="Dreamstime Photo Profile" href="http://travellingtwo.com/7845">selling your travel photos online</a>. This takes work but can be enjoyable if you like photography.</p>
<p>So, what should you look for in a camera? Here are our tips:</p>
<p><strong>#1. Smaller Is Usually Better.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>We carried a Nikon D80 SLR for 4 years. It took nice photos but it was also heavy, prone to dust spots and its large size sometimes intimidated people. In our opinion, a compact camera will often take just as nice a photo and it&#8217;s a lot easier to handle.</p>
<p>For a good example of what a small camera can do, check out the photos on the <strong><a href="http://www.14degrees.org/" target="_blank">14 Degrees</a></strong> site.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2032/5827293511_344cd44d95_m.jpg?resize=240%2C192" alt="Panasonic GF1" width="240" height="192" data-recalc-dims="1" />They were taken with a Canon Powershot G9 (the latest model is the <a href='http://travellingtwo.com/goto/azn/canong12' title='See Bicycling Cuba: 50 Days of Detailed Rides from Havana to El Oriente: 50 Days of Detailed Ride Routes from Havana to Pinar Del Rio and the Oriente'>Canon Powershot G12</a>). In 2011, we traded in our SLR for the <a href='http://travellingtwo.com/goto/azn/lumixgf1' title='See Kindle Touch 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6' E Ink Touch Screen Display, 3G Works Globally'>Panasonic Lumix GF1</a> with a 20mm pancake lens. The GF1 is still a great camera but has been replaced by the GF5. For something more advanced from Panasonic&#8217;s micro four-thirds range, you might also consider the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;tag=httptravellic-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;y=0&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;field-keywords=panasonic%20gx1&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps" target="_blank">Lumix GX1</a><img loading="lazy" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=httptravellic-21&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=2" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re determined to go for an SLR, you probably have your reasons. We won&#8217;t argue. Just get a large handlebar bag.</p>
<p><strong>#2. Battery Life Is Crucial.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Go for the longest lasting battery you can find. You may not be able to recharge your camera each night and the last thing you want is a dead battery just as a magnificent view opens up in front of you. For reasons of battery life alone, try to avoid cameras that use an LCD screen as a viewfinder (these eat energy), or get a spare battery.</p>
<p>You will have to decide whether you want a camera that takes AA batteries or a Lithium Ion cell. On the upside, AA batteries are universally available and you can usually carry multiple sets. On the downside, they often don&#8217;t last as long as a Lithium Ion cell. Either way, you&#8217;ll probably have to take a charger with you because very few cameras allow batteries to be recharged via USB or while still in the camera.</p>
<p><strong>#3. Get A Big Memory Card.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Whatever comes with the camera won&#8217;t be big enough. Memory cards are cheap these days and the more room you have, the less you&#8217;ll have to worry about burning CDs on the road. It&#8217;s worth going with one of the better known brands like Sandisk for speed and reliability.</p>
<p>A 2GB card would be a minimum size but 4-8GB is better if you plan to use the video function that comes with many cameras. A larger card will let you shoot more photos in the highest quality, which will be useful down the road if you ever want to sell your photos or print poster-size pictures of you and your bike.</p>
<p><strong>#4. Back Up Your Photos.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>How you do this will depend on the length of your trip and what else you&#8217;re carrying. Because our trip is long, we have a laptop for picture editing and storage (we use the open source and free <a title="GIMP" href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a> program for photo editing). We store the pictures on the laptop.</p>
<p>We also upload pictures to our personal server, to <a title="Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/travelling_two" target="_blank">Flickr</a> and &#8211; when we&#8217;re on a long trip &#8211; we burn DVDs of our photos to send home and upload our pictures to our website (usually a quick process even for full-sized JPEGS but sometimes it has to be delayed because of poor internet connections). Every few months, we delete the photos from our computer to free up space. If you&#8217;re not carrying a laptop, many internet cafes or photography shops will burn a DVD for you.</p>
<p><strong>#5. Get A Mini-Tripod.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/46782-2/gorillapodslr.jpg?resize=250%2C250" alt="Gorillapod" width="250" height="250" data-recalc-dims="1" />You&#8217;re unlikely to need a full-size tripod but there are a few intriguing miniature options, including the <a href='http://travellingtwo.com/goto/rei/gorillapod' title='See Joby Gorillapod SLRZoom with Ball Head'>Gorilla Pod</a> with legs that wrap around anything.</p>
<p>We use it for taking self-portraits and shooting videos on the move (the tripod will wrap around your handlebars to hold the camera securely to the bicycle). It also offers extra stability when you need a slow shutter speed to take photos in low-light situations.</p>
<p><strong>#6. Organise. Organise. Organise.</strong></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t sort your photos, it&#8217;s easy to end up with a digital version of the jumbled boxes full of paper pictures most of us have stuck in a drawer somewhere. We download our photos directly into folders based on each country we visit and sometimes further broken down by region or a specific event. This makes it a lot easier to find photos later.</p>
