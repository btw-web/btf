<h1>Planning To Stay Healthy</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="g2image_float_right" title="First Aid Kit" src="https://i2.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/32730-4/FirstAidKit-Hiker.jpg?resize=220%2C154" alt="FirstAidKit-Hiker" width="220" height="154" data-recalc-dims="1" /><strong>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, as the saying goes.</strong></p>
<p>To stay healthy on the road, make sure you&#8217;re in the best possible shape before you leave. Problems are much easier to sort out at home. You don&#8217;t want to ruin a vacation by trying to get medical treatment in a strange place.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ll want to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>See your dentist to get those cavities filled</li>
<li>Get an overall check-up</li>
<li>Arrange any yearly tests you may miss while away</li>
<li>Renew prescriptions</li>
<li>Get a First Aid kit and include things like bandages, medical tape, scissors, antiseptic cream, eyedrops, rehydration salts, an emergency blanket and medicines for pain, inflammation and diarrhoea.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many countries, your first aid kit can be quickly and cheaply restocked with the basics for a nominal fee in many countries. If you&#8217;re going to the <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/middleeast" target="_self"><strong>Middle East</strong></a>, northern Africa or Southeast Asia, you&#8217;ll find antibiotics, painkillers and other common treatments available everywhere for pennies. Just keep an eye on the quality and expiry dates of what you&#8217;re getting.</p>
<p><strong>Get coverage<br />
</strong>Get insurance and <strong></strong>check that bicycle touring is covered as a <strong>primary activity</strong>. Some policies claim to include cycling but in the fine print this turns out to be only if bike travel is a small part of your trip. If a bicycle is your main mode of transport, you may not be covered. Triple check this point with the insurance company! See more about <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/insurance-for-bicycle-tours" target="_self"><strong>choosing insurance</strong></a> for cycling.</p>
<p>Some cyclists prefer to go without insurance. They argument goes that the money saved by not paying for a policy can be used towards treatment as and when it&#8217;s needed. There is some truth to this. In <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/southeast-asia" target="_self"><strong>Southeast Asia</strong></a>, for example, you can get excellent medical care in Bangkok for very little money. For minor things like a sprained ankle or dental care, it&#8217;s easy to take care of the cost yourself. On the other hand, if something very serious happens the fees can quickly skyrocket. If you plan to go without a policy, consider how you will cope if you need medical evacuation and the bill runs into the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Where there is no doctor</strong><br />
Despite all your good planning, you may need medical help in a country where few people speak English or where standards are well below what you&#8217;re used to. Here are a few helpful tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carry a copy of the free book <a href="http://hesperian.org/books-and-resources/" target="_blank"><strong>Where There Is No Doctor</strong></a>. It offers an excellent and plain-speaking guide to basic medical care. There are also many other useful publications put out by the same organisation, the Hesperian Foundation. Take a copy on a laptop or print out the most relevant pages.</li>
<li>Check with luxury hotels, embassies or anyone in the local expat community. Someone will know a good English-speaking doctor.</li>
<li>A book like <a href="http://www.graf-editions.de/pointit/point_it_eng.html" target="_blank"><strong>Point It</strong></a>, with its diagrams of the human body, can help you communicate with a doctor.</li>
<li>Translate and write down the names of any conditions or allergies you have in the local language before leaving home.</li>
<li>Keep your family doctor&#8217;s phone number in a safe place. In a pinch, it could be reassuring to call and talk to someone you know and trust who can offer sound advice.</li>
</ul>
