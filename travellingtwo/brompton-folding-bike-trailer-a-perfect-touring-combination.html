<h1>Brompton Folding Bike + Trailer: A Perfect Touring Combination?</h1>
<p><strong>Can a Brompton folding bike and a trailer make the perfect combination for touring? </strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7056/8689083441_58ac37e17b_z.jpg?w=640" alt="Stijn on his Brompton + Radical Design trailer" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In this guest post for TravellingTwo, Stijn de Klerk checks out the performance of the Brompton with the <a title="Radical Design" href="https://www.radicaldesign.nl" target="_blank">Radical Design</a> series of trailers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p><strong>A couple of years ago I decided life without a car made a lot of sense.</strong></p>
<p>I still need to drive a car for work but do most other things by bicycle. My trusty full-size bike is often used for local shopping trips, and I bought a <a title="Brompton Folding Bikes" href="http://www.brompton.co.uk/" target="_blank">Brompton folding bike</a> so that I could use the bike in combination with the train more easily.</p>
<p>With these two bikes I had most transport and travelling requirements covered, except for the times when I needed to transport something big. This was why I added the <a title="Radical Design Cyclone" href="https://www.radicaldesign.nl/nl/producten/fietskarren/cyclone/cyclone-iv-trekking" target="_blank">Radical Design Cyclone trailer</a> was added to the stable. I don’t use it a lot but when I do use it, I love it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7048/8690239904_37f7c04930_z.jpg?w=640" alt="Radical Design Cyclone" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Unloaded, it’s hard to even tell I’m pulling a trailer at all. It functions perfectly and it&#8217;s built to last. Even better, it&#8217;s as much a duffle bag as it is a trailer and it converts from one into the other in under a minute.</p>
<p>Hooking the trailer up behind the Brompton was obvious as both the trailer and the folding bike are portable. I then started thinking: “wouldn’t it be great if the Brompton would fit inside the Cyclone trailer?” but unfortunately the Cyclone was too narrow for this. Then, lo and behold, Radical announced the <a title="Chubby Trailer" href="https://www.radicaldesign.nl/nl/producten/fietskarren/cyclone/cyclone-iv-chubby" target="_blank">Chubby trailer</a>: made wider and shorter than the Cyclone and designed to hold a folded Brompton.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8117/8689106805_f46c666906.jpg?w=640" alt="Chubby Trailer" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>As I’m a keen bicycle traveler, the next question in my mind was if I could use the Chubby plus a Brompton bike to create a combination that would allow me to take a train, plane or bus anywhere, including a lightweight camping set-up but with a minimum of the normal packing and luggage hassles that often go along with taking a touring bike and all the associated gear on public transport.</p>
<p>The moment of truth arrived when my cycling friends – Friedel, Andrew and Shane – conjured up the plan to take <a title="Easter camping trip" href="http://travellingtwo.com/13446" target="_blank">folding bikes out on a camping trip</a>. The company that makes the Chubby, <a title="Radical Design" href="https://www.radicaldesign.nl/nl" target="_blank">Radical Design</a>, was kind enough to lend us one for the occasion. I picked it up a few days before the trip, so I had my chance to give it a test.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Chubby Touring Setup</strong><br />
The total weight of a Brompton with a Chubby trailer and a bit of gear comes in at around 20 kilograms. That&#8217;s 10-14kg of Brompton bicycle (depending on the model), the Chubby itself (6kg) and your tent and sleeping bag (4kg). This is light enough to pass as regular check-in luggage with most airlines, and you can still carry the trailer (complete with bike and gear inside) by its shoulder strap over short distances. This video shows how it all works.</p>
<p><iframe width="530" height="298" frameborder="0" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Fp6StexKoEQ"></iframe></p>
<p>Any other camping kit or other gear has to be carried in a day pack (as carry-on) or in a small duffle bag (as additional check-in luggage).</p>
<p><strong>Quality And Durability</strong><br />
The heritage of Radical Design&#8217;s Cyclone trailer (first produced in 1997), means the Chubby has a long and thorough design evolution behind it. The whole trailer oozes quality and durability. I might even go so far as to say that it&#8217;s slightly over-engineered in places, even though it’s considerably lighter compared to many other bike trailers on the market like the <a title="BOB Trailers" href="http://www.bobgear.com/" target="_blank">B.O.B</a>, <a title="Burley" href="http://www.burley.com/" target="_blank">Burley trailers</a> and <a title="Monoporter" href="http://weber-technik.de/" target="_blank">Monoporter</a>. The <a title="Extrawheel" href="http://www.extrawheel.com/" target="_blank">Extrawheel</a> is perhaps the exception, but that&#8217;s a bit of a different proposition.</p>
<p>The overall robustness of the trailer shines through in the Chubby bag. It weighs in at a hefty 4kg (two thirds of the total weight) but equally will take a lot of abuse as it’s made from Cordura 1000 Fabric. Since the bag is there to protect the Brompton, it warrants the weight penalty of this heavy fabric to a large extent. The bag has a beefy, lockable YKK zipper and is reinforced in places where it matters, with extra padding to protect a folded bike inside.</p>
<p>From an engineering point of view I love the all-stainless steel, ball joint and quality Polyoxymethylene (POM) hitch construction. It&#8217;s one of the best and most elegant I’ve come across so far while looking for a bicycle trailer, in terms of sturdiness and one-hand ease of use.</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7056/8689076983_7ddd3460d6_z.jpg?w=640" alt="Chubby ball hitch" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The wheels are easily removed by pressing a button at the center of the hubs, which releases a quick-lock mechanism. They can be used in one of two positions: in the cycling position or in a second location further back on the Chubby, which then turns it into a walking trailer.</p>
<p>The hubs themselves are aluminum with industrial style sealed ball bearings on a steel axle, laced with stainless steel spokes into Brompton-size rims. This means a good selections of tires is available to suit any need and will match up nicely with whatever you are running on your Brompton.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7047/8689075239_238c3d0597_z.jpg?w=640" alt="Chubby hubs" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Stable Cycling</strong><br />
After giving the Chubby a look over, I decided to take it for a ride around town. As with my Cyclone trailer, I noticed that the two-wheel design made it relatively easy to move around by itself and hitch on/off compared to single-wheeled trailers. This <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">two wheel design makes it inherently more stable, which makes cycling with it a lot less nervous and it can handle higher payloads then most single wheeled trailers. </span></p>
<p>Once rolling in cycling mode, it becomes apparent how well-mannered this trailer is. When not loaded too heavily, one hardly notices that it&#8217;s there. Due to the fact that it has two wheels, it doesn’t negatively influence the stability of the bike and it’s even possible to rock the bike from side to side going up steeper inclines, much like you would an unloaded bike. One might think it would introduce more rolling resistance, but this is hardly noticeable and I suspect this is due to the relatively light loads the trailer tires need to support.</p>
<p>The only downside to the design might be that two wheels instead of one don’t track as well when on rough terrain or when mountain biking but I wasn’t planning on taking the Brompton on that sort of trip anyway.</p>
<p>Another big revelation was how easy it is to pack and unpack all the gear from a single hold-all style baffle bag. There is an inherent ease of having all your gear behind just the one zip and the amount of space is a dangerous luxury.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
Ultimately, I didn&#8217;t get the chance to put the Chubby through a full touring test. The weather forecast for our Easter tour was miserable and I didn&#8217;t want to return a completely mud-covered Chubby to Radical Design. That means this test and review won&#8217;t be truly complete until I can take the Chubby on a longer ride but my first impression was very favorable.</p>
<p>That said, I did take my Cyclone along for the weekend ride and this confirmed my suspicions about a trailer and Brompton being a perfect combination for touring. I&#8217;ll definitely be taking my Cyclone further afield this summer, and maybe one day I&#8217;ll add a Chubby to my collection as well.</p>
