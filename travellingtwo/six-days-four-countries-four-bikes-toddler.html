<h1>Six Days, Four Countries, Four Bikes and a Toddler</h1>
<p><strong>Caution: this post is being written to the soundtrack of the Teletubbies. As parents of a two-year old, free time is a precious commodity. Bribery is frequently required.</strong></p>
<p>Since an episode of the Teletubbies only lasts 24 minutes, we&#8217;ll keep this short and sweet. It&#8217;s the story of our Easter tour: six days through Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, including most of the <a title="Vennbahn" href="http://www.vennbahn.eu/en/" target="_blank">Vennbahn rail trail</a>.</p>
<p>We were cycling with two good friends, <a href="http://www.shanecycles.com/" target="_blank">Shane</a> and Stijn. As a group, we looked a bit like a bicycle circus with touring setups in all shapes and sizes.</p>
<div id="attachment_13840" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13840" class="wp-image-13840 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/travellingtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P1060455.jpg?w=600" alt="P1060455" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-13840" class="wp-caption-text">Group photo at the start of our trip.</p></div>
<p>We started with the Vennbahn because it was easy to reach by train from our home and was <em>supposed</em> to be flat. We aren&#8217;t scared of mountains but flat terrain is unquestionably a great advantage when you&#8217;re adding a toddler, a bike seat, a trailer and various child-related goodies to the standard bike touring setup.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s that? <em>Flat</em> you said? Ha ha. Try again. As it turned out, the trip involved a fair amount of climbing. Our workout began in Luxembourg City — not technically part of the Vennbahn (the trail begins about 70km further north) but a popular kicking-off point for many people.</p>
<div id="attachment_13804" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13804" class="wp-image-13804 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/travellingtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140418-_MG_3325.jpg?w=600" alt="Climbing a steep hill in Luxembourg - not technically part of the Vennbahn, but a taste of what was to come." data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-13804" class="wp-caption-text">Climbing a steep hill in Luxembourg &#8211; not technically part of the Vennbahn, but a taste of what was to come.</p></div>
<p>For us, the steep climb between the campground and the train station signalled the start of a weekend which was great fun but also harder work than we expected. The Vennbahn is largely flat but it also threw a few curve balls our way: unexpected hills, detours where parts of the trail were closed (this led to more climbing) and strong headwinds.</p>
<p>We look cheery in this photo, taken on one of the Vennbahn&#8217;s easy and paved sections, but the truth is that we&#8217;ve never been so exhausted from cycling 40-50km a day.</p>
<div id="attachment_13848" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13848" class="wp-image-13848 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/travellingtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/profile-shot-cropped.jpg?w=600" alt="profile shot cropped" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-13848" class="wp-caption-text">On tour as a family. Thanks for the picture, Stijn!</p></div>
<p>Normally we&#8217;d manage this distance easily but now we were carrying the extra weight of a toddler and all the associated luggage (toys, clothes, diapers). At the end of the day we weren&#8217;t resting, we were chasing a toddler around the campsite. This photo is a rarity: it shows one the few moments when Andrew got to sit down.</p>
<div id="attachment_13830" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13830" class="wp-image-13830 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/travellingtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20140420-_MG_3391.jpg?w=600" alt="20140420-_MG_3391" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-13830" class="wp-caption-text">Helping Daddy around the campsite.</p></div>
<p>Luke could occasionally be bribed into relative quiet with a pastry. As on so many bike tours in the past, bakeries quickly became a mandatory, twice-daily stop.</p>
<div id="attachment_13824" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13824" class="wp-image-13824 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/travellingtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/P1060677.jpg?w=600" alt="P1060677" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-13824" class="wp-caption-text">Pastries are a great tool for winning over kids on a bike tour.</p></div>
<p>On most nights, we didn&#8217;t make it much past Luke&#8217;s bedtime.</p>
<div id="attachment_13839" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13839" class="wp-image-13839 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/travellingtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P1060655.jpg?w=600" alt="P1060655" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-13839" class="wp-caption-text">Early bedtimes for everyone&#8230;.</p></div>
<p>When we weren&#8217;t chasing Luke around, we were marvelling at our different touring setups. We each had a different strategy, to meet different needs. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shanecycles.com/" target="_blank">Shane</a>, with his Brompton folding bike and Cyclone trailer from <a href="https://www.radicaldesign.nl/" target="_blank">Radical Design</a> — the perfect combination if you need to take trains and buses as part of your bike tour.</p>
<div id="attachment_13815" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13815" class="wp-image-13815 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/travellingtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/P1060501-edited-1024x682.jpg?w=600" alt="P1060501-edited" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-13815" class="wp-caption-text">Shane and his Brompton + Radical Design trailer.</p></div>
<p>Stijn was riding a titanium tourer of his own design with fat tires and a minimum of luggage. He&#8217;s preparing for a trip to Iceland later this year and wants a bike that is lightweight and handles well on dirt roads. In 2011, <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/7595">we interviewed Stijn</a> about lightweight bike touring <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/7595">in this podcast</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_13814" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13814" class="wp-image-13814 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/travellingtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/P1060508-edited-1024x682.jpg?w=600" alt="P1060508-edited" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-13814" class="wp-caption-text">Stijn and his lightweight touring setup.</p></div>
<p>As for us, Friedel was on a classic steel touring bicycle, built in 2005 by <a title="Robin Mather Cycles" href="http://www.whileoutriding.com/bike-talk/visit-robin-mather-cycles" target="_blank">Robin Mather</a>. This is the bike she rode around the world. The bike is great but we had to accommodate Luke&#8217;s <a title="Yepp bike seat" href="http://www.yepp.nl/uk/Home" target="_blank">Yepp bike seat</a> on the back, and this made it complicated to carry any other luggage. To be honest, we didn&#8217;t do a very good job of loading up this bike. We&#8217;re still working out the best way to pack and carry gear, while also having room for Luke on the back. More on that later.</p>
<div id="attachment_13813" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13813" class="wp-image-13813 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/travellingtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/P1060518-edited..jpg?w=600" alt="P1060518-edited." data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-13813" class="wp-caption-text">Friedel and Luke.</p></div>
<p>Andrew rode a <a title="Santos" href="http://www.santosbikes.com/" target="_blank">Santos Travelmaster 2.6 Alu</a> and piled it high with all the junk that Friedel couldn&#8217;t fit on her bike, including an <a href="http://www.ortlieb.com/_prod.php?lang=en&amp;produkt=rackpack" target="_blank">89L Ortlieb Rackpack</a>. Yes, we said 89 litres. That&#8217;s not a typo. We should have put a front rack on this bike to better balance the load but ran out of time before we left. Behind the bike is a <a href="http://www.thule.com/" target="_blank">Chariot trailer</a> — Luke&#8217;s place to nap and hide out from bad weather.</p>
<div id="attachment_13812" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13812" class="wp-image-13812 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/travellingtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/P1060531-edit.jpg.jpg?w=600" alt="P1060531-edit.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-13812" class="wp-caption-text">Andrew carrying most of the gear.</p></div>
<p>A picky person could probably find fault in our packing styles and choices but at the end of the day we all made it and we all had fun. Isn&#8217;t that what counts? The most important thing you can pack for a successful tour is enthusiasm and we had that in spades.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, we crossed borders.</p>
<div id="attachment_13816" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13816" class="wp-image-13816 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/travellingtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140418-_MG_3334.jpg?w=600" alt="20140418-_MG_3334" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-13816" class="wp-caption-text">Crossing into Belgium.</p></div>
<p>We experimented with wild cookery. We picked some stinging nettles and threw them into a pot with red peppers and onions. When cooked, they taste like spinach. What a great base for a pasta sauce or soup!</p>
<div id="attachment_13826" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13826" class="wp-image-13826 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/travellingtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P1060583.jpg?w=600" alt="cooking with nettles" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-13826" class="wp-caption-text">Cooking with stinging nettles.</p></div>
<p>We encouraged Luke to walk up the steepest hills, when pedalling became impossible.</p>
<div id="attachment_13844" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13844" class="wp-image-13844 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/travellingtwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/P1060614-cropped.jpg?w=600" alt="P1060614-cropped" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p id="caption-attachment-13844" class="wp-caption-text">Climbing steep hills. Thankfully Luke wanted to walk!</p></div>
<p>And after 6 days and 250km we returned home. We learned a lot from this first cycle-toddling adventure, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>40-50km a day is the maximum distance we should plan on cycling.</strong> If the terrain is hilly, we need to cut this distance further.</li>
<li><strong>Bike touring with a toddler requires a different packing setup.</strong> We&#8217;re considering a trailer for our next tour.</li>
<li><strong>A small bag with toys is a must-have.</strong> Luke has a little backpack which he&#8217;s allowed to fill with books, dinky cars and other favourite items.</li>
<li><strong>Falling asleep in a tent can be difficult for little ones.</strong> Be patient and be prepared to extend bedtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to prepare for our next tour: Switzerland! Yes, that&#8217;s right, after complaining about hills on the Vennbahn we&#8217;re going to one of the hilliest countries in Europe. What&#8217;s life without a good challenge? We&#8217;ll fill you in on that trip when we return in June.</p>
