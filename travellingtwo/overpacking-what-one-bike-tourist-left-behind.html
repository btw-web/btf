<h1>Overpacking: What One Bike Tourist Left Behind</h1>
<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="g2image_float_right" title="Keith's Lighter Panniers" src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/44502-2/DSC_2336.JPG?w=300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Keith and his heavily loaded bicycle.</p></div>
<p><strong>Ask any experienced bike tourist and they&#8217;ll certainly have a story about over packing and the things that never should have come along in their panniers.</strong></p>
<p>For us, the 2 plastic champagne flutes were the first to go. As newbie bike travellers, we put them in our panniers, while conjuring up dreams of romantic picnics in the flower-filled fields of Europe.</p>
<p>Reality soon hit. They took up too much space and our plastic camp mugs worked as well for wine as they did for morning coffee. A bit further down the road, we got rid of large, heavy wrench for taking off pedals (we could always get a bike shop to do this for us), a kite and one too many t-shirts.</p>
<p>So when <a href="http://www.keefontheroad.com/" target="_blank">Keith</a> rolled up to our front door last week, on his way to India, and said he had to lighten his bags, we were curious to see what would ultimately go.</p>
<p>Three days later, after a lot of sorting and debating, he handed us a large bag with a good 2 kilograms worth of things in it. In volume, the bag would easily fill a front pannier &#8211; space that Keith can now use for food or water when he needs to carry extra supplies.</p>
<p>Here is what he left behind&#8230;</p>
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" title="Keith's Discarded Things" src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/44558-4/keithstuff.jpg?resize=500%2C430" alt="keithstuff" width="500" height="430" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Everything Keith left behind&#8230;</p></div>
<p><strong>1. Base Layer</strong> &#8211; Keith already had an identical base layer. There was no point in carrying 2 of these shirts. They&#8217;re not something you&#8217;ll wear every day so just 1 is sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>2. Sunglasses</strong> &#8211; Again, Keith had a pair of sunglasses. Three pairs of sunglasses is definitely excessive!</p>
<p><strong>3. Strainer</strong> &#8211; The strainer insert that came with Keith&#8217;s dish set already performed this task, and the one he took along was more compact than the one he left behind.</p>
<p><strong>4. Windscreen </strong>&#8211; This is partly a case of duplication (a windscreen came with Keith&#8217;s stove) and partly a case of bad design. The windscreen doesn&#8217;t go all the way around the stove, making it of limited usefulness in a strong breeze.</p>
<p><strong>5. Extra Spokes</strong> &#8211; Keith had 3 times this many spokes with him. Generally, 3-4 spokes for the front and back wheels are enough.</p>
<p><strong>6. Buff</strong> &#8211; Duplication, again!</p>
<p><strong>7. Trainers</strong> &#8211; Keith was also carrying a pair of hiking boots, since he plans to explore the mountains of Slovakia. The hiking boots can be used in town too, making the sneakers redundant.</p>
<p><strong>8. Ortlieb Backpack Adapter</strong> &#8211; He already had a small backpack, and this backpack adapter isn&#8217;t so comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>9. Platypus Water Holder</strong> &#8211; More duplication. Keith already had several water containers, including an <a href='http://travellingtwo.com/goto/wiggle/waterbag' title='See Ortlieb Water Bag (2 Litre)'>Ortlieb water carrier</a>, with a shower attachment.</p>
<p><strong>10. Camp Lantern</strong> &#8211; Who needs one of these when you have headtorches and bike lights?</p>
<p><strong>11. Heavy Books </strong>&#8211; The small atlas was interesting but not detailed enough to be useful. A better option would be to save the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> entry for each country on a laptop or iPhone that you might be carrying. The Bicycle Touring Holland book had a series of smaller tours (hard to follow when you&#8217;re heading in a straight line across the country) and would soon be out of range.</p>
<p><strong>12. Mosquito Headnet</strong> &#8211; This might be good for tours in some areas, like northern Canada or Russia, but for Keith&#8217;s route through Germany, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary, it&#8217;s not really necessary. The mosquitos aren&#8217;t <em>that</em> bad.</p>
<p><strong>13. Belt</strong> &#8211; More duplication.</p>
<p>This is just one bike tourist&#8217;s clean out. Have you had to lighten your panniers in the past? What did you discard, and why? Tell us by leaving a comment.</p>
