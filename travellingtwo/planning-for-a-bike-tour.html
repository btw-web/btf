<p>Planning a route is quite fun, but how should you do it?</p>
<p>And then there are things like money to think about (how will you manage it while travelling?), travel insurance to consider (bike tourists need something a little special) and beginner&#8217;s mistakes to avoid.</p>
<p>We cover all of these pre-trip issues in this planning section for bike tourists.</p>

Think waaaaaay back, to the day you first tried to ride a bike. Remember that? Think about how hard it was to stay upright, trying time and time again to find your balance until finally, hours or even days later, someone finally let go and you wobbled off into the world.

What we didn&#8217;t realise was how many new friends we would make on the road, largely thanks to three websites which match travellers with potential hosts.
