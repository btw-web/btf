<h1>Insurance for Bicycle Tours</h1>

<h2>1. Bike Touring Is An &#8220;Extreme&#8221; Sport (not really, but&#8230;)</h2>
<p>We personally think bike touring is pretty safe but insurance companies see it differently. It&#8217;s frequently listed under the &#8220;extreme sports&#8221;  section of their policies. That rules out many generic backpacking policies.</p>
<h2>2. Bike Tours Can Be &#8220;Too Long&#8221;</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re bike touring for 90 days or less, it&#8217;s easy to find insurance. Even finding policies of up to 1 year isn&#8217;t too hard. For more than 12 months, however, you have to focus in on a specific set of long-term policies and &#8211; hopefully &#8211; find one that will let you renew the policy from overseas. This page focuses mainly on insurance for extended tours of several months.</p>
<h2>3. Bike Touring Is A Constant Activity</h2>
<p>Sometimes insurers will word their policies so you have coverage for bike touring, but only as an incidental activity. That means it shouldn&#8217;t be a major part of your trip. If a policy has this wording, it won&#8217;t be suitable for most bike tours, which involve daily cycling.</p>

<p>With all of these challenges, who <strong>does</strong> sell policies for bike touring?</p>
<p>In March 2011, we ran a survey of bike tourists who&#8217;d been on long tours to ask their advice. We had 25 answers from around the world (America, Italy, Britain, the Netherlands, Australia&#8230;) and here&#8217;s what we found out.</p>
<p><strong>32% Had No Insurance </strong> &#8211; This surprised us! We no idea that so many long-term cyclists don&#8217;t buy insurance at all. &#8220;We did it on a wing and a prayer,&#8221; said one person. The theory behind having no insurance goes a bit like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Disaster is unlikely. Insurance companies don&#8217;t make money unless the vast majority of people never make a claim, so luck is on your side.</li>
<li>When there is a problem, it&#8217;s likely to be small and cheap to sort out on your own. Indeed, in places like <strong><a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/thailand">Thailand</a> </strong>healthcare is relatively affordable and paying for small medical checkups, minor ailments and even something as serious as a broken leg shouldn&#8217;t impose a financial burden.</li>
</ul>
<p>The risk is that if you are unfortunate enough to truly encounter disaster, not having insurance could mean that you don&#8217;t get to good treatment quickly. It could also place a substantial stress on your family.</p>
<h2><a name="insurers"></a>Insurance Companies Used By Bike Tourists</h2>
<p>Of those who did have insurance, the companies they used are listed below, separated by country of residence. The list begins with an &#8220;International&#8221; category for policies or companies that work in multiple countries. Where we&#8217;ve easily found relevant information on the policies, we note this.</p>
<p>Most of these policies cover medical emergencies as well as some basic provisions for theft and loss of personal possessions.</p>
<p><small>*Keeping this list up to date and researching each policy is a big job for just 2 people running a blog 🙂 If you have information to share, please <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/insurance-for-bicycle-tours#comments">leave a comment</a> and we&#8217;ll use the comments to update the list.</small></p>

<h2><a name="questions"></a><strong>Questions To Ask</strong></h2>
<p>No matter which company you go with, when you&#8217;re comparing policies and prices ask questions like:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Does your policy cover cycle touring as a primary form of transport?</strong> Many travel policies aimed at gap year trips and backpackers only cover cycling as an incidental activity, not a primary one.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Can I renew this policy after one year and from abroad? </strong>For longer expeditions, this question is especially important. Some policies cannot be renewed or only from your country of residence.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. Will my policy be invalidated if I return home for a visit?</strong> The fine print may state that your policy becomes void if you go back home, even briefly. Because our trip started with a London-Montreal-London flight and then on to <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/europe" target="_self"><strong>Europe</strong></a>, we had to exclude many potential policies.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. How long can I be away in any given period?</strong> Some &#8216;year policies&#8217; only allow you to actually be away for a certain number of days in that year.</p>

<p>Check as well to see what is already covered by insurance you already hold. House insurance frequently provides some coverage and we met a New Zealand cyclist doing a tour of her home country, who said her car insurance included a break-down service if something happened to her bike!</p>
<h2><a name="nobike"></a><strong>Forget About The Bike</strong></h2>
<p>Many first-time bike tourists get hung up on finding cover for the entire value of their bicycle. Insurance for high-value bicycles is, however, expensive and hard to find in most countries.</p>
<p>All in all, the risk of having your bike stolen on tour is quite small, so this is one risk it&#8217;s probably best to just guard against yourself by taking <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/bikesecurity">basic precautions against bike theft</a>.</p>
