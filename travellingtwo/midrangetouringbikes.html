<h1>Midrange Touring Bikes</h1>
<p><strong>Trek’s classic 520 model, Surly’s Long Haul Trucker and the TX-400 from VSF Fahhradmanufaktur are just a few of the <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/biketouringbasics/how-to-pick-a-touring-bike/specific-touring-bikes-to-consider">touring bikes currently on the market</a> that strike a good balance between quality and price.</strong></p>
<p>Expect to pay $1,000-1,500 U.S. for bikes in this category: a significant investment but one that should give you many happy years of touring, and at a price tag that’s significantly cheaper than many high-end touring bikes.</p>

<p class="p2"><strong>Bikes in this category should have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>A Long Wheelbase </em>&#8211; This style of frame ensures that your heels have plenty of room to clear the panniers as you pedal.</li>
<li><em>Attachment Points</em> &#8211; Places where things like water bottle cages can be screwed on to the bike frame. These are sometimes called ‘braze-ons’. All mid-range touring bikes should accommodate 2-3 water bottles plus mudguards and luggage racks.</li>
<li><em>Decent Components</em> &#8211; The popular and robust Shimano LX and XT groupsets are often used.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">Don’t expect much of a choice, however, when it comes to custom options like colours and wheel size. Other places where manufacturers often cut corners include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Luggage Racks</em> &#8211; Mid-range tourers are often fitted with racks that are fine for moderate loads but not heavy touring. Often, only a back rack is included and some don’t have racks at all. You have to buy them as an extra accessory.</li>
<li><em>Gearing</em> &#8211; The gearing can be a bit to the high side, without a true ‘granny gear’ for serious hills.</li>
<li><em>Wheel Clearance</em> &#8211; Check to see if there is enough space between the frame and the mudguards to fit extra wide tires. If not, dirt road touring could be challenging.</li>
<li><em>Wheels</em> &#8211; The wheels will probably be machine built and not quite as strong as those built by hand.</li>
<li><em>Tires</em> &#8211; The ones that come with the bike may be a bit thin for dirt road touring. You may want to replace them, depending on the trip you’re planning.</li>
<li><em>Saddles</em> &#8211; They’re often not the most comfortable models.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">On the whole, none of these things matter much if your goal is to take shorter tours, mostly on paved roads. If you’re planning a more adventurous trip, factor in the cost of upgraded racks, wheels and a better saddle. With a few changes, you can turn a midrange touring bike into a decent bicycle for longer expeditions and still come in well below the cost of a high-end <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/biketouringbasics/how-to-pick-a-touring-bike/expedition-touring-bike">expedition touring bicycle</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">If you decide to make upgrades, try bargaining with your local bike shop. They might give you a discount on things like better quality tires and racks if you’re buying a bike at the same time.</p>
<p class="p2">Planning ahead also helps make your money go further. Try purchasing your bike in the autumn or winter, just as next year’s models are coming out. You might get a great deal on last year’s version.</p>
