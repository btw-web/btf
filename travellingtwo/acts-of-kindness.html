<h1>Acts of Kindness</h1>
<p><a href="http://gallery2.travellingtwo.com/v/2007/Morocco/dsc01513.jpg.html"><img loading="lazy" width="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/9646-2/dsc01513.jpg?resize=150%2C113" alt="The whole family" height="113" title="The whole family" class="g2image_float_right" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>If you want to believe in the good of the world, travel on a bicycle. It will restore your soul and faith in those around you. We have heard this said by many of our fellow cycle tourists and have found it to be true in our own travels. So often we have said to each other that we will have a lot of favours to return when, one day, we settle down again. We though it would be nice to log here a list of all the wonderful things that have happened to us through the kindness of others and also to note when we have been able to return that kindness through small gestures. The second list is rather shorter than we&#8217;d like but certainly when we have a home again its doors will be open for travellers.</p>
