<h1>John O&#8217;Groats To Land&#8217;s End: The Traffic-Free Way</h1>
<p><strong>Every year, hundreds of cyclists set out to bike the distance between the northern tip of the United Kingdom &#8211; John O&#8217;Groats &#8211; and the southern point of Land&#8217;s End.</strong></p>
<p>The trip &#8211; often referred to as LEJOG or JOGLE, depending on direction &#8211; is about 1,500km long. It&#8217;s a great distance for a bike tour of anywhere up to a month (depending on your appetite for mileage) but not everyone makes this trip on the most quiet of roads.</p>
<p>There are alternatives, however, including one route that British cyclist <a title="David Piper" href="http://www.tra-velo-gue.co.uk/home.htm" target="_blank">David Piper</a> created. It goes from end-to-end across Britain, on quiet country roads and bike paths. He took a few minutes to tell us about it. You can also <a title="GPS JOGLE LEJOG" href="http://ridewithgps.com/routes/1307372" target="_blank">view the GPS track</a>, which we created from David&#8217;s map.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p><strong>Why did you create this route?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I live close enough to Land&#8217;s End to see streams of &#8216;End to Enders&#8217; trudging up the A30 dual carriageway in the summer. While they&#8217;re fighting traffic and slashing their tyres on the broken glass littering the scant shoulder, I&#8217;m slashing my wrists in despair at their lack of imagination and planning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I assume they have plotted the rest of the route in much the same manner when (with a little time invested) they could have taken the road less travelled along the blissful B-roads and scenic cycle tracks that criss-cross our green and pleasant land.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I&#8217;d been asked by the anti human-trafficking charity <a title="Bringing Freedom" href="http://www.facebook.com/bringing.freedom" target="_blank">Bringing Freedom</a> to plot such a route and I was so pleased with the results I thought I&#8217;d share it with you!</p>

A rough outline of the route. Click for a bigger version on Flickr.</small></p>
<p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>How did you map out this particular route? </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I wanted to use as many of the Sustrans National Cycle Network (NCN) routes as possible, and traffic-free roads wherever possible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Scotland really stood out in this respect. It was a cyclist&#8217;s dream of empty roads, fabulous mountain-scapes and enough bird and wildlife to keep any budding David Attenborough happy. We saw lapwings and ospreys.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the far north, we could even use some main roads. It&#8217;s wilderness up there, and we saw more wild deer than wild drivers!</p>
<p><strong>Can you give us a quick summary?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sure!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We started in John O&#8217;Groats. From there, we climbed over rolling moorland south of <strong>Beauly</strong> and dropped down to <strong>Loch Ness</strong>. We braved the <strong>A82</strong> to the quaint town of Fort Augustus but on reflection it would have been far better to pick up the tiny road (<strong>NCN 78</strong>) that follows the southern bank of the lake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/travelling_two/7189651197/"><img loading="lazy" title="Land's End To John O'Groats" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7234/7189651197_a795be95b5.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="Land's End To John O'Groats" width="500" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We then went off-road, beside the <strong>Caledonian Canal</strong>. We rode past snow-capped Ben Nevis to <strong>Fort William</strong>, then south of <strong>Loch Leven</strong> on  parts of the old railway (<strong>NCN 78</strong>). Next we detoured around <strong>Loch Awe</strong> past the <strong>Falls of Cruachan</strong> and the underground hydro-electric plant pumping out millions of watts of clean, renewable energy. Hidden, silent valleys beside <strong>Loch Eck</strong> took us through the <strong>Argyll Forest</strong> to the <strong>Dunoon Ferry</strong>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Next it was on to <strong>B743</strong> and a handful of unclassified lanes. These took us east over the bleak and desolate Southern Uplands to <strong>Abingdon</strong> &#8211; Scotland&#8217;s highest village. From here, the <strong>NCN 74</strong> uses a deserted road all the way to <strong>Gretna Green</strong> &#8211; where eloping lovers could once be wed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/travelling_two/7189651271/"><img loading="lazy" title="Land's End To John O'Groats" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7222/7189651271_ec709eb206.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="Land's End To John O'Groats" width="500" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We climbed into the <strong>Lake District</strong> on the <strong>B5299</strong> (<strong>NCN 7</strong>) to <strong>Caldbeck</strong>, then south on <strong>Pasture Lane</strong> to the utterly beautiful <strong>Ullswater</strong> before tackling the only real mountain in the whole trip &#8211; the <strong>Kirkstone Pass</strong>, descending to the touristy waters of <strong>Windermere</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/travelling_two/7189651079/"><img loading="lazy" title="Land's End To John O'Groats" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8011/7189651079_b4d51fe327.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="Land's End To John O'Groats" width="500" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>NCN 55</strong> &amp; <strong>NCN 5</strong> took us most of the way from <strong>Preston</strong> to <strong>Worcester</strong> through the heart of England&#8217;s Industrial Revolution on miles of canal paths. Then it was on to the old railtrack <strong>NCN42</strong>. We were disappointed that only a little of this was complete but soon it will be a grand route from Cheltenham to Welsh Chepstow.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Bristol</strong> is the home of <a title="Sustrans" href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/" target="_blank">Sustrans</a> so a traffic free route into the city wasn’t hard to find. It took us out again over Brunel&#8217;s iconic Clifton Suspension Bridge and later on the <strong>Strawberry Line</strong> (<strong>NCN26</strong>), heading south to the gorgeous gorge of <strong>Cheddar</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/travelling_two/7374892924/"><img loading="lazy" title="Land's End To John O'Groats" src="https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7226/7374892924_16ca025ee8.jpg?resize=500%2C375" alt="Land's End To John O'Groats" width="500" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In Somerset, we traced a canal from <strong>Bridgewater</strong> to <strong>Taunton</strong>, followed by the <strong>B3227</strong> for the 50 miles between Taunton and <strong>Barnstaple</strong>. Next it was the <strong>NCN27 Devon Coast to Coast</strong> route, making sure we stopped at the legendary <a title="Yarde Cafe" href="http://www.yarde-orchard.co.uk/yardecafe.html" target="_blank">Yarde Café</a> for a pint of homemade cider.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now in Plymouth, we crossed into Cornwall and rode the magnificent coastal road along <strong>Whitsand Bay</strong>, hugging the coast until <strong>Looe</strong> before following the river valley to <strong>Liskeard</strong>. A short blast along the <strong>A38</strong> was unavoidable but we soon got on unclassified roads that trace the new A30 as far as <strong>Fraddon</strong>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">From there, the <strong>B3275</strong> follows the Ladock Valley toward <strong>Truro</strong>. Cornwall&#8217;s tin mining heritage was evident along the coast-to-coast cycleway from <strong>Devoran</strong> to <strong>Portreath</strong>. From there, we were treated to a fabulous run along the <strong>North Cliffs</strong> on <strong>B3301</strong>. Finally, it was <strong>NCN 3</strong> all the way to <strong>Land&#8217;s End</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What were some of your favourite parts of the trip?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In Scotland, we briefly followed <strong>NCN 78</strong>. It&#8217;s part of an old railway line and in a few years it should connect <strong>Oban</strong> with <strong>Loch Ness</strong>. It hugs the stunning coastline and is quite possibly the best cycle track I&#8217;ve ever ridden!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I also loved the area around <strong>Preston</strong> and <strong>Worcester</strong>. You ride through the heart of England&#8217;s Industrial Revolution on flat, pretty and traffic free canal paths. And don&#8217;t forget the added benefit of a smattering of lock-side pubs! Willows wept and otters leapt, whilst happy holiday-makers waved cheerily from their converted barges. Fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>Did you ever need off-road tires?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Not really. We first went off-road beside the Caledonian Canal but the surface was fine grit so our standard road tyres could cope with it. This was also the case with the other unpaved sections nationwide.</p>
<p><strong>Isn&#8217;t your version of JOGLE a little long?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our total route was about 2,000km but so what if it took a little longer? That&#8217;s the whole point, isn&#8217;t it? If you want to sprint up the highway, the record is under two days, so knock yourself out! Or maybe the traffic will first…</p>
