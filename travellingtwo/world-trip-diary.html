<h1>World Trip Diary</h1>
<p><strong>This is the diary of our trip around the world by bicycle.</strong></p>

<p>Our legs pedalled for over 48,000km, taking us through 30 countries along the way. The entries on this page are organized so you can read the journals by country, in (mostly) chronological order.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&#8217;ll find that we visited a country twice but all the journals are on one page.</p>

We traced our way through Strasbourg, Lyon, the Ardeche region and down to the Spanish border on the Mediterranean coastline.

We loved the little bars, where we discovered great coffee, smoked ham, cheap glasses of sherry and massive loaves of bread. The interior, with its unspoiled cobblestone-street villages and open landscape was equally impressive. What we were less happy about was the traffic on the Mediterranean  <a class="read-more" href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/world-trip-diary/spain">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p></div><div class="half-right"><hr /><h4 class="link" id="post-3805"><a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/world-trip-diary/morocco">Morocco </a></h4><div class="post-thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/8807-11/dsc_0950.jpg?resize=75%2C75" alt="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/world-trip-diary/morocco" /></div><p>Morocco has long been one of our favourite countries to visit. It&#8217;s close to Europe, yet exotic and we are completely in love with the amazing landscapes of the Sahara desert.

It was cheap, with beautiful and quiet roads and fantastic local food. Think hearty sausages, fresh fish, fantastic red wine and plenty of cheese to sample. The clean and affordable municipal campgrounds only added to our happiness.

Fantastic coffee, even better gelato, stunning mountains&#8230; what more could a cyclist ask for? Well, how about plenty of fields to relax in (see the picture), ancient history around every corner and a joie de vivre in every day life.

Temperatures rose above 40°C but because we didn&#8217;t understand the language, we were completely oblivious to just how hot it was. We also weren&#8217;t very clever cyclists yet, and insisted on cycling through the day, instead of in the cooler morning and evening hours.

Everything was new and exciting. We had a big adventure getting into Istanbul, agonized over our first bus ride (and later concluded that we didn&#8217;t have to cycle every single mile) and revelled  <a class="read-more" href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/world-trip-diary/turkey">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p></div><div class="half-right"><hr /><h4 class="link" id="post-3813"><a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/world-trip-diary/greece">Greece </a></h4><div class="post-thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/17800-5/dsc02402.jpg?resize=75%2C75" alt="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/world-trip-diary/greece" /></div><p>We cut across northern Greece, on our way to Turkey. Our route took us over some high mountains, including the Katara Pass, and we encountered some fierce sheep dogs but what we&#8217;ll always remember Greece for is our first flat tire of the trip!. The food compensated for our disappointment at finally getting a flat.  <a class="read-more" href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/world-trip-diary/greece">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p></div></div><br clear="all"/><div><div class="half-left"><hr /><h4 class="link" id="post-3873"><a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/world-trip-diary/syria">Syria </a></h4><div class="post-thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/18732-7/dsc_5878.jpg?resize=75%2C75" alt="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/world-trip-diary/syria" /></div><p>Bolstered by our positive experience in Turkey, we continued on to Syria. Some members of our family were worried that we wouldn&#8217;t be welcomed there, but they didn&#8217;t need to fret so much. Syria turned out to be nearly the friendliest country on our tour, only slightly overshadowed by the kindness we found later in  <a class="read-more" href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/world-trip-diary/syria">Read&nbsp;More&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p></div><div class="half-right"><hr /><h4 class="link" id="post-3878"><a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/world-trip-diary/iran">Iran </a></h4><div class="post-thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/20496-5/dsc_7048.jpg?resize=75%2C75" alt="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/world-trip-diary/iran" /></div><p>Iran takes the prize as the country we liked best of the 30 we visited.

From the incredibly hospitable people to the amazing cultural sites and the wide, open landscapes, we find it hard to think of a better place to ride your bike.

Instead, we were going to explore Pakistan and China. But visa hurdles sent us through Central Asia at the last minute and so we found ourselves doing the 1-week dash across the eastern corner of Turkmenistan.

The rest of the country, well, to be honest we were lukewarm on it. While Samarqand was nice, it didn&#8217;t compare to what we&#8217;d seen in Iran.
