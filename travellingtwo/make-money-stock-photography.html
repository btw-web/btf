<h1>Make Money While Travelling: Stock Photography</h1>
<p><small>This is the first in a series of articles where we look at ways to make money while you&#8217;re travelling.</small></p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;re not professional photographers, so when someone suggested to us that we could make money by selling pictures of our bike tour around the world, we thought they were crazy.</strong></p>
<p>That was in 2008. Since then, we&#8217;ve slowly built up a profile on stock photo website <a href="http://www.dreamstime.com/Travellingtwo_more-latest-adition_pg1" target="_blank">Dreamstime</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/thumbs.dreamstime.com/thumblarge_359/12332584743oug9T.jpg?w=260" alt="Dreamstime Andrew" data-recalc-dims="1" />People who need photographs for everything from websites to magazines and brochures can see our images and purchase a digital copy. We&#8217;ve been surprised at what they&#8217;re interested in.</p>
<p>By far the biggest seller is a series we did of <a href="http://www.dreamstime.com/no-hope-image7956361" target="_blank">Andrew looking depressed on the street</a>. This photo alone has earned nearly $100 &#8211; not bad for 30 seconds work in Kuala Lumpur!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also discovered that pictures of crops like <a href="http://www.dreamstime.com/tea-leaf-image11673918" target="_blank">tea leaves</a> and <a href="http://www.dreamstime.com/rice-fields-image11673930" target="_blank">rice fields</a> are popular. Mundane things like reading a <a href="http://www.dreamstime.com/man-reading-a-newspaper-image5575963" target="_blank">newspaper</a> sell well too. We&#8217;ve even sold a few <a href="http://www.dreamstime.com/bicycle-tourist-image16170202" target="_blank">bike touring photos</a> but they&#8217;re not our top earners.</p>
<p><strong>How Easy Is It?</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/thumbs.dreamstime.com/thumblarge_291/1216570059ccKPw3.jpg?w=260" alt="chilli pepper" data-recalc-dims="1" />Stock photography is something anyone can do.</p>
<p>You do need a certain level of equipment. Your iPhone isn&#8217;t going to cut it. That said, you don&#8217;t need the fanciest camera and a million different lenses. A SLR camera is certainly desirable but better quality point and shoot cameras would be fine.</p>
<p>Equally important is your ability to find pictures that are in demand. Forget about photos of your pet dog. Instead, look for images to illustrate generic topics and themes like <em>family</em> or <em>adventure</em>, topics in the news like the environment, infrastructure such as railways and road or photos of landmarks you visit along the way such as the <em>Eiffel Tower.</em></p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s The Upside?</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/thumbs.dreamstime.com/thumblarge_309/1220683606P9YGHS.jpg?w=260" alt="Sticky Rice" data-recalc-dims="1" />This is something you can do anywhere, at any time. Once you get into it, stock photography becomes a great way to use otherwise idle time. Stuck waiting for a train? Take pictures of the station. Waiting for your food in the restaurant? Photograph the cutlery, your drink, the menu&#8230;</p>
<p>Taking stock photographs is also a great incentive to improve your skills. By mastering the techniques needed for good stock photography &#8211; clear pictures, focused on one subject and well exposed &#8211; your own personal snapshots will benefit and that&#8217;s nice, even if you don&#8217;t sell many photos.</p>
<p><strong>What Are The Pitfalls?</strong></p>
<p>Stock photography takes time. You&#8217;ll have to edit your photos (you might be doing that for yourself anyway). Then they need to be uploaded to a stock photo website where you add a title, categories, keywords and model releases if the image is of a person.</p>
<p>If there are problems with the photograph, or the agency has too many similar pictures, your image may be rejected. Sometimes you have a chance to touch up and resubmit photos with minor problems (dust spots, for example).</p>
<p>All of this online work can be difficult when you&#8217;re on the road and don&#8217;t have a constant internet connection. We save our uploading for when we have a stable, fast connection.</p>
<p>Stock photography is also increasingly competitive. It can be hard to find subjects and angles that aren&#8217;t already covered by someone else. Some websites have an initial vetting process that makes it difficult to become a contributor so your images have to be top-notch quality to get in the door.</p>
<p><strong>How Much Will I Make?</strong></p>
<p>The answer to this is a big<strong> IT DEPENDS</strong>. It will be slow at the beginning but your earnings should gain momentum over time as you build a portfolio of images. You will make more money if you submit your photos to several sites but we don&#8217;t have the time for this so we only add photos to one website.</p>
<p>We only work sporadically at stock photography and we make about $50 U.S. a month out of it. A fortune? Not exactly. It&#8217;s not to be sniffed at either, however. Over time it adds up and it&#8217;s enough to pay for a flight every year or quite a few beers.</p>
<p>Other <a href="http://www.dreamstime.com/Margouillat_info" target="_blank">cyclists we&#8217;ve met</a> do fund their trips through stock photography but they treat it as a business and spend much more time on taking and editing photos. For us, it&#8217;s just a bit of pleasure money and a source of income that&#8217;s easily taken on a bike tour.</p>
