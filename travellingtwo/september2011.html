<h1>September 2011 Bike Touring Newsletter</h1>
<p><strong>Welcome to September&#8217;s bike touring newsletter.</strong></p>
<p>Here are some of the most popular posts on the blog over the past month:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Gear We Love</strong> &#8211; <strong>Wheel Locks</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Wheel Locks" src="https://i1.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6157/6180417538_058245a691.jpg?resize=200%2C200" alt="Wheel Locks" width="200" height="200" align="right" hspace="2" vspace="2" data-recalc-dims="1" />A good touring bike needs a good lock, and in Europe the wheel lock is a seen on nearly every bicycle.</p>
<p>It attaches to your bike frame, above the rear wheel, and it functions like this: put the key in and push down on a lever so that a metal ring slides between the spokes of your back tire, locking the bike.</p>
<p>We have the <strong><a href="http://travellingtwo.com/goto/azn/abus4850ring" target="_blank">Abus Amparo 4850 LH NKR</a><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=httptravellic-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B004HXI70G" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></strong> locks on our touring bikes and we love them for brief stops along the way. They take only seconds to engage, and are always ready to go &#8211; no more rummaging around in your bags for a lock, or unwrapping a lock from your bike frame.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn&#8217;t a total bike security solution. For longer stops, overnight security or high-risk areas like cities, you&#8217;ll want another lock so you can secure your bike to a fixed object. For brief pitstops, however, the wheel lock is ideal. We use ours all the time.</p>
<p>When we started writing about wheel locks, we realized just how much we had to say, so we created a whole page full of pros and cons on these locks:</p>

<p><strong></strong><strong>Tip Of The Month</strong> &#8211; <strong>Do It Yourself Kickstand</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Bikes With Sticks for Kickstands" src="https://i1.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/5770721866_60f74dcf98.jpg?resize=250%2C188" alt="Bikes With Sticks for Kickstands" width="250" height="188" align="right" hspace="2" vspace="2" data-recalc-dims="1" />Way back in the <strong><a href="http://travellingtwo.com/monthly-newsletter/june2010">first edition of our newsletter</a></strong>, we talked about how to make a bicycle kickstand out of a stick. Yes, a stick. That might sound silly, but if you don&#8217;t have a kickstand on your bike or if yours breaks en route, it&#8217;s a nifty thing to be able to do.</p>
<p>At the time, we didn&#8217;t have a good photo of this trick in action. Now, <strong><a href="http://www.rolling-tales.com/" target="_blank">Emma &amp; Justin</a></strong> have sent us a picture and a little description of how two sticks found by the roadside prop their bikes up, and perform many other tasks:</p>
<blockquote><p>We broke the sticks off at a suitable height so they could be propped up against the bicycle frame. Good sticks usually have a bit of flex in them and are a little green &#8211; drier older sticks often aren&#8217;t strong enough. Benefits including being able to park your bike in the middle of fields, forests or on sand easily and we&#8217;ve even used them as part of sun shelters in the desert. They&#8217;re much cheaper than a stand but there&#8217;s an art to parking your bike using a stick and ensuring that it doesn&#8217;t fall over. They can be used as dog deterrents but I wouldn&#8217;t want to suggest anyone go out and hit animals with them. Waving around and shouting should do the trick.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emma &amp; Justin are currently in China, and heading for the edge of the Tibetan Plateau. Check out their great blog, <a href="http://www.rolling-tales.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Rolling Tales</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Featured Bike Tourists</strong> &#8211; <strong>Finding Sachi</strong></p>
<p><img title="Finding Sachi" src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/47749-2/findingsachi_com.jpg?w=300" alt="Finding Sachi" align="right" hspace="2" vspace="2" data-recalc-dims="1" />Finding Sachi is the blog of Sachiko Takao and her bicycle tour around Japan, in search of wonderful Japanese food. She&#8217;s biking the country from south to north, from Okinawa to Hokkaido.</p>
<p>The <strong><a title="Finding Sachi" href="http://findingsachi.com/blog/2011-is-going-to-be-delicious/" target="_blank">first blog entry</a> </strong>explains her reasons for the tour, and how she was a relatively inexperienced cyclist before starting the trip.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just to give you an idea of what a challenge this is going to be for me, the longest cycling I have ever done in my life was up to two hours at a time, and that was just strolling along the beaches in Los Angeles, followed by a glass of beer and French fries.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the<strong> <a title="Finding Sachi" href="http://findingsachi.com/blog/day-189-192-cycling-hokkaido-from-prison-to-pond/" target="_blank">most recent entry</a></strong> describes her ride along railway lines, lakes and through forests in the north of Japan.</p>
