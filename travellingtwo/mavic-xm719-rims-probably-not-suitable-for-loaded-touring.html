<h1>Mavic XM719 Rims: Probably Not Suitable For Loaded Touring</h1>
<p><strong>When choosing a rim for the next wheel on your touring bike, you may want to avoid Mavic&#8217;s XM719 model.</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve recommended this rim in the past (based on our own experience and the recommendations of others) but it seems something has changed. In the past month, several bike tourists have contacted us to report broken XM719 rims.</p>
<p>Bert and Gillian were the first to get in touch. They&#8217;ve broken five of these rims in just 9,000km of cycling around North America. In an email, they wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>It started happening after only 1,000km on the back wheel of the bike with the heaviest load. By the time we completed 3,000km a further two back-wheel rims broke on the same bike. At that stage we replaced the back rim on the heavier bike with a SunRingle Rhyno Lite rim, which solved the problem. During the last week, the same issue developed on the front wheel on the bike with the heaviest load (after 9,000km) as well as the back wheel of the bike with the lesser load (after 6,000km).</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2862/11270073023_e6b982478b_z.jpg?w=640" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>Bert &amp; Gillian&#8217;s touring bikes.</small></p>
<p><a title="Francesco Alaimo" href="http://ivegotabike.com/">Francesco Alaimo</a> also told us that a crack developed in his XM719 rim after just 1,000km. He was able to ride the bike a further 3,000km before the rim gave out entirely.</p>
<blockquote><p>In Bishkek I met a guy who had to substitute his XM719 for exactly the same problem after less than 5,000km and a <a title="Cycling About" href="http://cyclingabout.com/index.php/2013/05/broken-gear-almost-one-year-of-bike-travel/" target="_blank">couple on a tandem</a> had exactly the same problem previously.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2866/11269703576_4571b82b17_z.jpg?w=640" alt="Cracked XM719 rim" data-recalc-dims="1" /><small>Francesco&#8217;s cracked XM719 rim.</small></p>
<p>When we asked for opinions about rims on Facebook, <a title="Charles Coderre" href="https://www.facebook.com/TravellingTwoBicycleTouring/posts/10152015862336873">Charles Coderre</a> also reported failures of the XM719 rim (although his rims did last quite a bit longer than for the other cyclists we heard from).</p>
<blockquote><p>We are riding fully loaded (bike and gear = 80 to 100 pounds). The Mavic XM719 we had on our rear wheels did not last. After 8,000 kilometers, my rim cracked on the entire circumference and was starting to open. I changed for Sun Rhyno Lite. After 13,000 kilometers my wife&#8217;s rear MavicXM719 rim was also starting to crack and open.</p></blockquote>
<p>To double-check these reports, we asked two bike experts for their opinion. Both <a title="M-gineering" href="http://www.m-gineering.nl/" target="_blank">Marten Gerritsen</a> and the wheel builders at <a title="Bike4Travel" href="http://www.bike4travel.nl/" target="_blank">Bike4Travel</a> recommend <a title="Ryde Sputnik" href="http://www.ryde.nl/en/">Ryde Sputnik rims</a> as a durable choice, and both had concerns about the suitability of Mavic rims for loaded touring.</p>
<p>We put these concerns to Mavic and they said the XM719 was a reliable rim with a return rate of less than 0.5%.</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve been selling those kind of rims to globe trotters for decades now (so thousands of them) and with very few issues. That said, this type of use (heavy load on the bike and rider) makes the rim more prone to this kind of fatigue. We have no influence on the wheel assembly and very often those kinds of cracks happen if the spoke tension is too high.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mavic will replace a rim under warranty (if it&#8217;s found to be defective) but that&#8217;s of little use to most bike tourists. When your rim breaks during a tour, you just need to get it repaired and keep moving. The last thing you want is to be stuck in one place for days (or possibly weeks) negotiating a replacement with a company — especially when that company makes contact so difficult!</p>
<p>On the <a title="Mavic website" href="http://www.mavic.com/" target="_blank">Mavic website</a>, there are no obvious contact details (only lists of shops selling their products). It took us several days to get any reply via their social media channels. Compare that to our experience, when a <a title="Bontrager" href="http://bontrager.com/" target="_blank">Bontrager</a> rim failed on us after just 3,000km of loaded touring. <a title="easy rim refund" href="http://travellingtwo.com/1611" target="_blank">We were able to contact them easily and had a no-questions-asked refund within days</a> (our previous rims from Alex and Alessa lasted for nearly 30,000km before we opted to replace them).</p>
<p>Given all of this, we can&#8217;t recommend the XM719 rim for touring anymore. It&#8217;s true that any one of these failures could have been caused by something other than the rim (eg. over-inflation of the tire or a poorly-built wheel) but when we hear so many reports about a single rim, it naturally makes us cautious. To be on the safe side, go for an option such as the Ryde Sputnik. Hopefully that will save you the trouble caused by a rim failure on the road!</p>
