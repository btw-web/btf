<h1>Stephen Lord: Author of the Adventure Cycle-Touring Handbook</h1>
<p><img class="g2image_float_right" title="Stephen Lord and his bike" src="https://i0.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/43100-2/P1010396.jpg?fit=640%2C350" alt="Stephen Lord and his bike" height="350" data-recalc-dims="1" /><strong>In the four years since it was first published, the <a href="http://adventurecycle-touringhandbook.com/" target="_blank">Adventure Cycle-Touring Handbook</a> has become a must-read for cyclists dreaming of long-distance journeys to remote corners of the globe.</strong></p>
<p>With its mix of practical advice, route outlines and tales from the saddle, it has plenty of inspiration for future tours.</p>
<p>The next edition will hit the shelves mid-May and we can&#8217;t wait to see what it looks like (not least because we wrote the chapter on Central Asia). In the meantime, we caught up with author Stephen Lord and asked a few questions about how he got into bike touring, his favourite places and some of the things he&#8217;s learned along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Do you remember when you first discovered bicycle touring?</strong></p>
<p>Of course I can remember &#8211; I’m not that old! I had forgotten bicycling for a few years when I started work but then I saw a mountain bike for the first time in 1986. You looked at the bike and you saw this incredible potential to go anywhere and do anything. I bought one in New York and took it to Japan, where I worked for 6 years. It wasn&#8217;t long before I thought, I&#8217;m going to get racks on that and go somewhere with it. I was plotting my escape from the banking world at that time and it was obvious the bike was going to be a big part of it.</p>
<p><strong>Has your style of touring changed over the years?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve tried lots of things, touring on mountain bikes, then a few drop-bar tourers and cyclocross bikes and gradually moved towards getting tough frames and gear because I broke everything else. I think when you&#8217;re older you want more comfort. You forget that when you first toured you didn&#8217;t even have a mattress or you forgot the sleeping bag or the tent had holes in it. When you&#8217;re older, that&#8217;s just not a fun trip. I&#8217;ve found through the years my mattresses are getting thicker. The bag is getting warmer. It&#8217;s a shame in a way, but that&#8217;s the way it goes.</p>
<p><img title="Cycling in Ladakh" src="https://i1.wp.com/gallery2.travellingtwo.com/d/43091-2/J3264x2448-00539.jpg?w=500" alt="Cycling in Ladakh" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>What bike are you riding at the moment?</strong></p>
<p>I just built a mountain bike from the wheels up &#8211; chromoly frame, oil’n’coil shock, SLX groupset, cable disc brakes and downhill, disc-only rims. No braze-ons. I’ll use it for pub-to-pub touring or get an Extrawheel Voyager if I want to carry a tent. I&#8217;ve still got my Roberts Roughstuff. I bought it secondhand but it fits me perfectly. It&#8217;s a very traditional custom-build with fillet-brazing, British racing green and it came with drop bars, which I took off after a few tours. The frame-builder was horrified when he saw that and said he hoped I’d clean it if I was going to use photos of it in the book.</p>
<p><strong>The Roberts Roughstuff is a very expensive bike. Do you think you need an expensive bike to go on a tour?</strong></p>
<p>No, not at all. You could go with something around £500 (about $750 U.S.), if you&#8217;re looking at a new bike. Don&#8217;t go lower because you want a good groupset and you don&#8217;t want rubbish wheels. The mid-range is where to look. The <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/midrangetouringbikes/marin-muirwoods">Marin Muirwoods</a> was ideal but now it’s an alu frame. The <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/resources/midrangetouringbikes/marinmuirwoods29er">29er</a> is still steel though, and has cable discs. Great as long as you don’t mind 700c wheels. I don’t &#8211; but my trips are only a couple of months so I don’t worry about replacing wheels while on tour.</p>
<p><strong>Can you remember one great day on the road?</strong></p>
<p>There were too many of them! I think the greatest time would be the greatest place: Big Sur, California &#8211; I rode it three times. It&#8217;s absolute heaven: ozone coming off the ocean, wildflowers, the smell of the redwoods. It&#8217;s a protected area and not commercialised at all. It&#8217;s really quite hard riding but usually you&#8217;ve got a tailwind if anything. My most hilarious moments were the zany trips in Japan &#8211; you never knew where you’d end up and that made it always exciting. People seem much more obliging overseas than they do at home.</p>
<p><strong>What about a few challenging moments?</strong></p>
<p>Here are the things that get increasingly difficult for me: smoke, traffic and bad food. I always lose weight when I travel. I just can&#8217;t get enough calories. It&#8217;s a problem for anybody. If you ride mountains, it&#8217;s like the Tour de France every day. You&#8217;re heavily loaded, you&#8217;re going 50 miles +, you need 4,000 calories and you&#8217;re getting 3,000 if you’re lucky. And if you&#8217;re eating in Central Asia you&#8217;re eating 3,000 calories and regurgitating 2,000 of them! Getting good nutrition is a big problem for me.</p>

<p><strong>Where will your next tour be?</strong></p>
<p>My next tour, having built this mountain bike, is to do the South Downs Way. It&#8217;s only 100 miles. It&#8217;s a two day tour but we could probably spin it out to 3 nights. The whole thing is off road. It&#8217;s bridleway and it goes from Winchester to Eastbourne. It&#8217;s a perfect practice tour for anyone who wants to do rough touring. You have public transport at either end and there&#8217;ll be pubs each night (and maybe lunchtime too…). After that I’d like to do the <a href="http://www.bikepacking.net/routes/transandalus-trail/">TransAndalus Trail</a>. I’m trying to get the adventure-touring feel, but closer to home. I think in Europe or North America or Australia and New Zealand you have to go off-road for that same sense of space and wildness and rural friendliness that you get touring the Third World.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s one piece of advice you&#8217;d give to other bike tourists?</strong></p>
<p>The hardest thing is to let go of everything &#8211; to slip the surly bonds (that poem is well worth googling). No matter when in life you start, this really is the big one, the great unknown, a huge physical, emotional and psychological or spiritual challenge and adventure. Everyone goes through it; just be yourself and make it your trip and not someone else’s. Life is only fun when it&#8217;s the life you choose. That&#8217;s what I like about cycling, it&#8217;s infinitely individualistic and customisable.</p>
