<p>From October till May you will have snow on the passes, in June this will start to melt. May and June are in the valleys however a great time to be; everywhere a sea of flowers and nice temperatures. July and August are hot in the valleys but the passes will be clear and it is the best time to go to the “Jailoos” (summer pastures) and visit Tash Rabat, Saimaluu Tash and Lake Son Kul. In September it will start to get cold in the mountains, the herdsman will leave the jailoo. October will again be cold in the mountains and the first snow will fall. As in spring, the valleys are still lovely warm, although you might have rainy days.</td>

<td width="557"><strong><a name="1_5"></a>1.5 Safety </strong></p>
<p>In Bishkek you get sometimes hassled by policemen, official or not. If they ask your passport, show it, in 99% it is a routine control. If they ask you to show how much money you have, never do this. In case you are in trouble say that you want to phone the tourist police (ph……. ), and ask them to identity themselves. Usually the problem is then solved. Everywhere in the country it is safe to camp. Follow your feelings. If you do not feel good about sleeping alone, ask people if you can camp in their meadow, yard or near their yurt.</p>
<p>A nuisance in whole Kyrgyzstan can be drunken people at any time of the day. Get out of their way, or just be friendly and try to move on.</p>
<p>At some places there are control posts on the road. This can be police, customs, ecological control etc. If they stop you, just show your passport. It is often just out of curiosity. Never give money or gifts.</p>

</strong><strong><a name="1.6"></a>1.6 Visas &amp; extension </strong></p>
<p>Visas are necessary. You can obtain a one month visa from the embassies ( Brussels ) or upon arrival at Manas airport. Extensions are easily to get at the OVIR in every big city. It is no longer compulsory to register within 3 days at the OVIR for nationals of most Western countries. If you doubt whether you need registration, just pass by at OVIR (Bishkek: Kievskaya 58). When entering the country overland ask for an entry stamp. If they do not have any, go in the next big town to the OVIR and ask one there. It will save you from a lot of hassle leaving the country.</p>
<p>The 72 hour transit visa for Central Asian countries (have a Kyrgyz visa and you could transit Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan without a visa) does not exist any more.</p>
<p>A special border permit is necessary if you want to cycle off road, near the Chinese and Tajik border. You can get this permit at OVIR (Bishkek-Osh) or sometimes at a special border detachment (Karakol). Ask a travel agency for latest information and even better ask them to do this for you. If you are planning to cross the border to China via Irkeshtam your Chinese visa is sufficient and an additional border permit is not necessary.</p>
<p>Trekking permits can be bought on the spot at the Ministry of Sport and Tourism, 17 Togolok Moldo 220657/212843. Trekking permits are necessary for Engilchek and Pik Lenin.</p>

<p>Manas airport is now a modern airport with all facilities. Daily flights (2-3) to Osh , Jalal Abad (in summer every day in winter twice a week) and Batken (recently started, once a week). To Osh 40$ one way. If the plane is big enough (Yak 40 too small, but Antanov no problem) you can take your bicycle. You are allowed to take 15 kilo. For every additional kilo you pay 0,20 $.</p>

<td><strong><a name="1.9"></a>1.9 Accommodation </strong></p>
<p>Cycling in Kyrgyzstan means that you have to be self supporting. There&#8217;s no guarantee that you will find accommodation in hotels or home stays every night and some times you might not find food or a place to eat. This absolutely counts if you cycle off the beaten tracks. Several travel agencies organize bicycle tours. You cycle, they carry your gear and organize food and accommodation in tents.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>No camping sites but you can camp everywhere; Kyrgyz are nomads and also live in tents.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>CBT (community based tourism) has in the main cities offices and members where you can find accommodation and food at private houses(8$-11$ B&amp;B). At some places (SonKul, Tash Rabat, around Kochkor) accommodation in yurts.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Hotels, almost every town has his old Intourist hotel (3$-20$). Can be cheap but sometimes they still charge you foreigner prices. Usually rundown, straight forward, soviet style accommodation and service.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Some private hotels exist. They are usually better but also more expensive (15$-80$).</div>

</li>
<li>
<div>Stolovayas; canteen style places where the locals fill up with food and vodka. Cheaper then the restaurants with all the same menu and formica interior. Found all over the country (1$-2$). Mostly they serve only during lunch and dinner time.</div>

<div>Bazaars in almost every big or medium sized town. You will find all things you need for cooking yourself. People will sell snacks and there are usually some canteens with basic menu.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Shops and small kiosks in every town and sometimes along the road. Basic items like macaroni, tinned fish, cookies, oil, sweets, mineral water, cigarettes and vodka. Usually no vegetables or fruit. Bread you&#8217;ll only find in the larger centers, in the villages every household bakes its own bread.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Yurts. Usually you can buy bread, cream, yoghurt kumis (horse milk) and dried cheese from the people at yurts.</div>

<td colspan="2"><strong><a name="2"></a>2 On the road</strong></p>
<p><a name="2.1"></a>•  <strong>Road condition </strong></p>
<p>Kyrgyzstan gives you open spaces, high passes, beautiful lakes, beaches, high pasture mountains and desert like landscapes, all connected through roads constructed in Soviet time. As Kyrgyzstan was the main supplier of sheep meat for the Soviet Union the pastures were heavily used in summer and a myriad of roads connect them with the valleys and cities, ideal for cycling.</p>
<p>The main roads are, although mostly rough for cars, good for cycling. The main part of the Bishkek-Osh road has been repaired and is in perfect condition. The stretches Tash Komur – Jalal Abad and Usgen-Osh are still under repair in 2005. Most of the roads especially in the mountains and to the jailoos are unpaved, but good for cycling</p>
<p>Apart from the Bishkek-Balykchy road the traffic is not heavy, sometimes non existing. Traffic rules do exist but are not observed. A car has always right of way, a driving license is bought, which says enough. On the main roads people tend to drive too fast, especially in the evenings and at night be careful. Better to stop before sunset. At night there are no street lights. Manhole lids can disappear overnight. Use (excessive) of alcohol does not prevent somebody from driving. Signposts are almost none existing and if there are, they are 99% in Cyrillic.</p>
<p>Although this all sounds as rather dangerous, I feel safe and most drivers take care of cyclists.</td>

<p>A nice, broad, flat road brings you in 30km to the centre of Bishkek.</p>
<p><strong><a name="2.2.2"></a>2.2.2 Bishkek- Balykchy-Karakol-Kochkor</strong></p>
<p>General information</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>From Bishkek you can follow the northern road along the Kazak border to a point some 10km past Tokmok or the southern more direct road. The northern road is broad and quiet but longer and cars drive faster. The southern road has much more traffic, goes through villages with plenty of places to eat and, in Tokmok, accommodation. 8Km past Kemin you can take another parallel road for some 40km (on your left) before it joins the main road again in the gorge. This road, which is compulsory for trucks, is a bit quieter.</div>
</li>

<p><strong><a name="2.2.3"></a>2.2.3 Son Kul<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Son Kul is a high mountain lake (3000m). From June to September herdsman live in yurts around the lake. Horses, sheep, cows are happily running around. It is a small paradise but at this altitude climate changes rapidly and at night it is always cold. Take in mind that it is a big climb over passes of around 3100m and there is really not a lot of air up there. There is a dirt road around the lake. All roads to the lake are rough but no problem with a bike. No accommodation or food on the roads to the lake. At the lake CBT , ‘Shepherd life&#8217; and other agencies offer accommodation in yurts. It is a terrific place for cycling but …. the weather! You can get food in the yurts, but there are no shops! It is becoming popular amongst tourists, which is reflected in the prices. At the CBT office in Kochkor you can get tariff lists for everything (food, accommodation, guides, horse riding etc.)</p>
<p>There are four roads going up to the lake, all over high passes above 3100m.</p>
<p>From the east:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Turn off at Sari Bulak at the Kochkor-Naryn road. This is the most commonly used road. After a small pas you come into a beautiful valley, leading to the second pass.</li>
<li>Turn off at the Kumys stalls at the Kochkor-Naryn road. This point is past the Dolon pass. A beautiful road with lots of up and down and jailoo life, ending in a fantastic climb. Better to go down! As this is the driest side, the fishermen can use this road even in winter.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>From the south:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Via Yangy Talap off the Naryn-Baetov road. Good road, first through some forest patches, with again a nice climb at the end.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>From the north:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>There is a road connecting the lake with the Kochkor-Chaek road. It is the least traveled. I did not ride here.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="2.2.4"></a>2.2.4 Kochkor-Suusamyr </strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong> </strong>General information</p>
<p>Apart from the Kyzart pass (2664m) this is a gradually up-down-up ride in a valley along a river. At the end you climb to Suusamyr. In the valley and gorges there will always be wind. Beautiful gorge-landscape with nice rock formations. From Chaek to Suusamyr desolate.</p>

<p><strong><a name="2.2.5"></a>2.2.5 Kochkor &#8211; Naryn &#8211; Kazarman &#8211; Jalal-Abad </strong></p>
<p>General information</p>
<p>Kochkor-Naryn is apart from a few km close to the pass paved. If you do not want to visit Naryn you can ride via Jergetal, nice quiet short cut. From Naryn an asphalt road (till Baetov) follows first the Naryn River . From Baetov it is climbing on a rough dirt road to the Ak Kya pass. A nice down hill over a partly nice asphalt road brings you to Kazarman. To the Kaldaman pass it is a good dirt road with little traffic. In the Fergana Valley a nice asphalt road to Jalal Abad. The climbs to the passes are long and tiring. You should be self supporting. Same for the northern road to Kazarman which you can take from Ak Talaa. This road is desolater as most cars take the road via Baetov. I found the southern easier and the landscape more beautiful (mountain desert), the southern however is 80km longer.</p>

<p>General information</p>
<p>You can cycle to Tash Rabat on the main Naryn-Torugart road, which is for the main part dirt road. From Ak Beyit you can take the road to Baetov. It is said to be a nice road, but I have not tested it myself.</p>

<p>General information</p>
<p>From Talas over the pass and through Chatkal valley there is hardly any traffic. Chatkal valley is a rough place, rough roads and people, but has a beautiful canyon. The passes are hard on the knees. Chatkal valley is a remote and poor area.</p>

<a name="2.2.9"></a>2.2.9 Jalal Abad- Osh -Sari Tash-Tajikistan/China </strong></p>
<p>Without an Uzbek visa and multiple enter visa for Kyrgyzstan , it is not possible to ride direct to Osh via Uzbekistan , you have to follow the detour via Usgen.</p>
<p>There is a direct road from Usgen to Gulcha as well as several short cuts. Direct road via Kara Gulcha to Gulcha is partly paved and near the pass (2490m) rough. In Kara Gulcha bazaar, shops and basic hotel.</p>
<p>If you want to skip Osh , go immediately left at the crossing, 2km before you enter Osh . On the road to Sari Tash little traffic. The last pass before Sari Tash is a killer. There are actually two passes: after the first one, the road goes slightly downhill for a few kilometers, to start climbing again to the second pass, slightly lower.</p>

<p>Most normal roads in Kyrgyzstan are ‘off road&#8217; enough for me. However…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>From Naryn you can ride on a good dirt road via Eki Naryn to the Kichi Naryn valley. The dirt road continues via the Tosor pas 3800m to Torsor on the south side of Lake Issyk Kul. When we were once walking there we saw Lada Nivas on this road and to me cycling, for the fit once, does not seem a problem.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>An other possibility from the Kichi Naryn valley is to continue and cross the Kerese Tash (3680m) and end up on the Barskoon-Kumtor road. I personally think you can better walk here but some Russians we met seemed to enjoy it.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>The third possibility is to take from the Kichi Naryn the valley going up to the Ara Bel (3890m) pass. This road also leads to the Barskoon-Kumtor road. Cyclist I spoke told me that apart from some river crossing it was great cycling. They rode up the Kumtor road and rode down to Naryn.</div>

<p>Stories go that you can ride from Engilchek, along the Chinese border to the Suek pass and on to the Barskoon-Kumtor road or even continue to Chatyr Kul. I met nobody who actually did it. If you want to try, get a border permit.</p>
