<h1>Bikepacking Year in Review</h1>
Each year bikepackers from across the world are setting the standard for this new subset of mountain biking. Whether it be laying down an unthinkable race performance, biking thru unknown territory, putting together trails and roads to make a new route, or capturing compelling footage for our viewing pleasure, bikepackers everywhere are accomplishing amazing feats. It is a never ending cycle, and the bar set by athletes and organizers continued to be raised in 2014.  Please take some time to read about the recognized athletes in each category for our inaugural <b>Bikepacking Year in Review presented by <a href="http://www.bikepacking.net/" target="_blank">Bikepacking.net</a> and Bikepackers Magazine.</b>

<h3><b>Race Performance &#8211; </b><i>honoring the best performances in bikepacking races this season.</i></h3>
<b><a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/q-kurt-refsnider/" target="_blank">Kurt Refsnider</a> &#8211; Arizona Trail Race</b>: At the start of the 2014 Arizona Trail Race, it was clear that Kurt and Aaron Gulley were gunning for sub 48 hour rides. If you are familiar with the first 300 miles of the AZT, you know how difficult this task would be. In the 9 year history of the race, there has only been 4 individuals that posted sub 60 hour times. What is more interesting was the guy up front, Kurt, who not only beat 48 hours, but he crushed it, finishing with a time of 45 hours and 7 minutes. Although records are made to be broken, this one may not be touched for a while.

<b><a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/qa-jefe-branham/" target="_blank">Jefe Branham</a> &#8211; Tour Divide</b>:  It is obvious that Jefe knows a thing or two about bikepacking, and he yet again continues to show how he is still one of the sport’s elite. <a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/jefe-branham-tour-divide/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jefe won the <b>Tour Divide</b> this year</span></a>, a year where winter weather was the news during the first 4 days. The overall record was not broken, but without the weather up north, he would have been pretty close to beating it. Jefe finished with at time of 16 days, 2 hours, and 39 minutes, more than two days ahead of 2nd place. It only took one performance this year from the legendary bikepacker to get recognized from a number of media outlets as well as cycling manufactures. (NB)

<b><a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/blake-bockius/" target="_blank">Blake Bockius</a> &#8211; 5 Bikepacking races:</b> While some folks like to do the same few races year after year, Blake has taken a different path. Blake started and completed 5 bikepacking races this season, all in the span of 8 months. Of the 5 races he did this year; <b>Stagecoach 400, Tour de los Padres, Oregon Outback, Smoke and Fire 400, and the Tour North California,</b> 4 of them were first year races.  Blake now has completed 9 different bikepacking races in his career and shows no signs of slowing down. (NB)

<b><a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/qaiditarod-trail-invitational/" target="_blank">Jeff Oatley</a> &#8211; Iditarod Trail Invitational:</b> The most difficult winter ultra in the world is called the Iditarod Trail Invitational. It is a 1049 mile race on the Iditarod Trail, starting in Anchorage and ending in Nome, AK. This was Jeff’s 10th ITI and his most memorable yet. Jeff took advantage of the conditions and crushed Mike Curiaks record of 17 days, 2 hours. Jeff finished in 10 days and 3 hours. (NB)

<b>Mike Hall &#8211; Trans Am Bike Race:</b> Each year we follow Mike Hall and see what he is up to. He is usually up to something big, whether it be racing around the world or riding the Tour Divide.  An experienced and tremendously strong competitor, Mike is a podium contender whenever he lines up. This year he took on the Trans Am BIke Race, a new race that follows the Trans Am Route. Mike battled bad weather, steep climbs, 18weelers and desolate highways to beat out Jason lane  by 20 hours. He finished the 4000 mile route in 17 days and 16 hours. (NB)

<b><a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/colorado-trail-race-perfect-run-gone-bad/" target="_blank">Neil Beltchenko</a> &#8211; Colorado Trail Race-</b> With some of the sport’s biggest names sitting out this year’s CTR, Neil knew the 2014 race was his to lose. While most racers were focused on surviving and finishing the 550 miles of trail, the 26 year old from Crested Butte, Colorado was looking to set a high bar for the “new course”. Through horrendous weather conditions, Beltchenko battled his way across the CTR, tearing his lateral meniscus, staving off hypothermia, and setting a new course record.  This inspirational run followed Neil’s third place finish in the 2014 AZT300, crushing the course with a time of 2 days, 1 hour, and twenty minutes.

<strong><a href="http://www.bendbulletin.com/outdoors/2227413-151/22-days-2745-miles-biked" target="_blank">Alice Drobna</a> &#8211; Tour Divide:</strong> When you think of record setting women Tour Divide performances, you likely think of Eszter Horanyi. Although Alice did not beat Horanyi&#8217;s 2012 Tour Divide time, she came close. What she did do was set the new Women&#8217;s Single Speed Record with at time of 22 days, 6 hours, and 36 mins. The endurance athlete kept consistant the entire time, battaling the horrendus weather up north to finish in the top 15 overall, beating out Sarah Caylor by a half of a day. (NB)

&nbsp;

<b><a href="http://zenondirt.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Eszter Horanyi</a>&#8211; Continental Divide Trail: </b>One of the strongest women cyclists in the world, and quite possibly the best female bikepacking resume on the books, Eszter Horanyi continues to set the standard, and gives men and women a reason to get after it. Horany bikepacked the entire length of the Continental Divide Scenic trail from south to north with her partner in crime, Scott Morris. There were lots of up’s and lots of down’s, (as seen on her blog) but one this is certain, the grit and tenacity that this woman has, is truly an inspiration. She totaled 124 days on the trail. (NB)

<b><a title="Experiences on the AZT by Alison Kinsler" href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/alison-kinsler/" target="_blank">Alison Kinsler</a> &#8211; AZT 300: </b>Alison showed up at Parker Canyon Lake this year not really knowing what to expect, other than what friends had told her. Sitting on her trainer in Afghanistan serving as an orthopedic surgeon, she focused on what it would be like. Imagining was all she could do. When it came to game time Kinsler showed up and finished 5th overall (out of 52) with a time of 2 days, 15 hours, and 20 minutes. She came in just shy of the overall women&#8217;s record of 2 days, 13 hours, and 15 minutes. (NB)

<b><a href="http://www.mountainbikeradio.com/the-ride-fatbikes-show/heather-best/" target="_blank">Heather Best</a> &#8211; Iditarod Trail Invitational 350:  </b>As we mentioned above with Jeff Oatley, who happens to be her husband, the 2014 Iditarod Trail Invitational was a year to remember. Every single record that could be broken was, including the women’s 350 mile version to McGrath. Best showed up only 10 hours after winner Kevin Breitenbach to take the female win and record with a time of 2 days 14 hours and 13 minutes. She shattered the previous record by 22 hours and finished 9th overall. (NB)

<strong><a href="http://trayp.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Tracey Petervary</a> &#8211; Arrowhead 135, Fat Pursuit, Liguria, Fitzbarn: </strong>Tracy is no stranger to ultra endurance / bikepacking races, especially those of the winter variety. Tracey had a huge year starting in January with the Arrowhead 135 where she braved the crazy cold temperatures to be the first women finisher and round out the overall top five with a time of 27 hours. She then set her sights on the first annual Fat Pursuit, her husbands new winter ultra where she finished 2nd overall. She joined Jay in the Liguria Mtn Divide Benchmark over in Italy and rounded out here season at the Fitz-barn 450. A extremely impressive season, Jay and Tracey continue to keep pushing the limits, and its exciting to watch.

<h3><b>Adventure/Expedition </b><i>-Honoring the athlete(s) who completed the most visionary, daring and adventurous bikepacking trip(s) of the year.</i></h3>
<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<b>Justin Simoni: </b> When we heard Justin was going to attempt to summit each and every 14er this year, we were blown away. When we heard he was going to do it in a self-supported fashion cycling from trailhead to trailhead, we thought it was crazy. When he stood atop his final 14er, Longs Peak, he was an instant legend, not only in the cycling world but in the climbing world, too. Justin finished this amazing adventure in 34 days and 12 hours, beating the previous fastest known time. (NB)

<a href="http://topofusion.com/diary/cdt-2014-diary/" target="_blank"><b>Scott Morris and </b><b>Eszter Horanyi</b><b>:</b></a> In a year of many amazing firsts, Scott Morris and Eszter Horanyi’s run on the 3,500 plus mile Continental Divide Trail might be difficult to beat. The duo spent 124 days cycling and hiking 3,623 miles and gaining over 450,000 feet in elevation.  Not only did the pair’s efforts on the CDT enthrall the bikepacking and outdoor adventure communities, Morris and Horanyi ‘s efforts and stewardship have provided land managers and trail advocacy groups with a solid example of collaboration along long-distance backcountry routes, enjoyed by multiple user groups. Without a doubt, Scott and Eszter’s completion of the CDT is a gift to our community and they’re expedition will no doubt inspire others to tackle this monstrous route. (MA)

<h3><b>Rookie </b><i>&#8211; Honoring the bikepacker who’s rookie race season, or first season of bikepacking adventures are impressive and inspirational.</i></h3>
&nbsp;

<strong>Rick Miller &#8211; AZT 300/ CTR:</strong> Rick’s first bikepacking trip was a year ago on the Kokopelli&#8217;s Trail and that initial adventure has led to an inspirational rookie ultra season. At 58 yrs old, Rick bested athletes half his age turning in an impressive 3 day, 15 ½ hour run on the AZ 300 and completing his first Colorado Trail race in sub 7 days! Perhaps even more impressive is Rick’s persistent attitude, love of being outdoors, and positive perspective on the bikepacking tribe. “The bikepacking community is one of the best groups of people I’ve met. Cheerful (or at least humorous) in the worst conditions and always helpful and supportive, especially to newcomers.” We’re excited to see more from Miller in 2015!(MA)
