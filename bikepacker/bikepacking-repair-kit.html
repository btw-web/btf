<h1>Bikepacking Repair Kit</h1>
Below are a number of items that should be considered in your bikepacking repair kit. When bikepacking, you are typically further away from help. Being able to get yourself out of a hairy situation could prove to be the difference between being out in the backcountry, or stuck in it.

<a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Feat_img.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-5744 size-full" src="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Feat_img.png" alt="Feat_img" width="850" height="565" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Feat_img.png 850w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Feat_img-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></a>

Your essential daily repair kit can go a long way, but there are things that should be considered while out riding for an extend period of time. Remember just as bike parts and bikes are unique, so are their parts &#8211; like screws, spokes, derailleur hangers, etc.

Many of you will bring the whole list, while others will test the limits. The list below can easily be translated from dirt to snow adventures.<br /><br />

 <br />
<b>Spare Tube(s)</b>&#8211; An obvious need when flatting. Whether your tube or tubeless setup has failed you, tubes are heavy but extremely important to carry. <br />

<b>Tire Lever &#8211; </b>Although your multi tool can be used in a pinch, tire levers will make the job much easier especially with certain tires. Make sure it’s a tough one, we like <a href="http://pedros.com/products/tools/wheel-and-tire/tire-levers/" target="_blank">Pedro&#8217;s tire levers</a>. <br />

<b>Patch kit &#8211;</b> If or when your tube options have run out, a patch kit will get you on the road. <br />

<b>Tire boot &#8211;</b> A tire boot is important when you slash your sidewall. You want to insert the boot, so your tube is not exposed / pooping out. Park makes a great tire boot, but a dollar bill or anything similar to a bill will do. <br />

<b>Pump &#8211;</b> To pump you up, your tube/tire that is. Consider a larger volume pump for your fat bike tires. <br />

<b>Valve core remover &#8211; </b>Tubeless setups usually mean removable valve cores. It is important to bring this if and when you have issues with your tubeless set up. It makes for easy installation of more tubeless sealant, which can prove beneficial after you stitch up your sidewall. pliers will also do. <br />

<b>Extra Tubeless Sealant &#8211; </b>Those 2 ounce bottles are not that bulky, and could keep your tire tubeless. <br />

<b>CO2 and dispenser &#8211; </b>Not only is this a great tool to have for on-the-fly repairs, it’s important if you are repairing a tubeless and have broke the seat. If you still have Big Airs, lock your doors. <br />

<b>Shock Pump</b> &#8211; If you have any shock on your bike, make sure you dial your PSI with your loaded rig well in advance. This way you can leave the pump at home, if you&#8217;re skeptical, than just bring one. They are heavy, but 2 in 1 tire and shock pumps are now available.

 <br /><b>Multi-tool w/ chain break and spoke wrench &#8211; </b>Whatever multi tool you take, make sure it has tools for YOUR bike. For instance, a large enough hex wrench to take your crankset off. <br />

<b>Quick link x2 &#8211;</b> (for your specific speed) &#8211; A simple improper shift could result in a broken chain, bring extra links and know how to replace them. <br />

<b>Spare chain links</b> &#8211; If something drastic happens to your chain it’s good to have some extra chain to work with, along with the quick links <br />

<b>Valve stem/core &#8211; </b>The last thing you want is a valve that does not hold air in your tubeless system. Cores are usually the culprit, and can easily be replaced. <br />

<b>Presta to Schrader valve converter &#8211; </b>this cheap and simple tool can help pump your tire up with a compressor whether you&#8217;re at a gas station or run into a friendly off roader. <br />

<b>Derailleur hanger</b> &#8211; All hangers are different, make sure you have one specific for your bike, and the proper tool to remove and install. <br />

<b>Rotor Bolts &#8211; </b>All it takes is one rotor bolt to ruin your trip, bring spares. <br />

<b>Chainring Bolts &#8211; </b>A lot of torque is put on these bolts, bring a specific replacement as well as a way to remove your crank if need be. <br />

<b>Brake pads</b> &#8211;  Bad weather, harsh conditions, and active braking can increase the wear time on brake pads. It is a good idea to bring spares, as well as a pin/screw that holds them in. <br />

<b>Spare shifter/brake cable &#8211; </b>If you use mechanical brakes or shifters it’s a good idea to know how to replace the cables in the event of an emergency. <br />

<b>Spokes and nipples</b> &#8211; A simple rock or stick can snape a spoke. A spare spoke could mean a true ride or no ride. Make sure your multi-tool has a nipple wrench and make sure you bring the proper spoke length. <br />

<b>Shoe cleat and bolts &#8211;</b>  If you&#8217;re running a clipless system, it’s good to have a spare cleat and bolts. <br />

<b>Lube and cloth</b> &#8211; To make your drivetrain last and function properly, it’s good to lube your chain every day on your adventure. <strong><strong> <br /></strong></strong><b>Zipties &#8211; </b>A simple piece of plastic can be a big help. <a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/group_3.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-5747 size-full" src="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/group_3.png" alt="Bikepacking Repair Kit" width="800" height="508" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/group_3.png 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/group_3-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><br />

<b>Super Glue &#8211; </b>A multi purpose tool that has endless uses, we have found it nice when stitching a sidewall, as it helps coagulate with the Stan&#8217;s to create a seal. Bring it! <br />

<b>Knife/mini leatherman &#8211; </b>To hunt, survive, sculpt, or work on your bike. A leatherman is a great tool mainly because of the pliers and knife. Leave the the valve core remover at home if you have pliers. <br />

<b>Needle</b> &#8211; Whether your stitching your ripped bag or your slashed sidewall, it is helpful to have a curved needle and make sure to bring spares. <br />

<b>Strong nylon thread</b> &#8211; For your bag, or sidewall slash, and many other uses. <br />

<b>Tape</b> &#8211; Electrical, Gorilla, and athletic are great resources. We also bring ultra strong Tyvek tape, this will help repair a slashed sidewall and more. <br />

<b>Various sewing materials</b> &#8211; You never know what could happen out there, a bear ripping apart your bag or a tree snagging one. It is good to have something to make repairs with. You could always use some of your clothing. We bring some thin rope, a strap, velcro, and some fabric. <br />

<b>Lighter</b> &#8211; An essential item not only for your survival kit, but helpful for sewing.

<strong><br />The difficult part is trying to figure out how to pack and organize your kit. We like to put things we use more often easily accessible. But thats for you to figure out because bikepacking is much more than just riding your bike.</strong>
