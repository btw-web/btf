<h1>Sixpoint Resin: My Desert Island Beer</h1>
<em><span style="color: #808080;">Content and images by Alex Roberts</span></em>

Maybe it is the fact that it has been a quite cold week here that has me thinking of the list of things I want if ever stranded on a deserted island. For food I could get by with strip steaks grilled on my Big Green Egg and Twinkies. If I could only have one album it would be Radiohead’s <em>OK Computer</em>. Only one bike? Give me a REEBdonadonk. And if I could have supply drops of one particular beer, it would be Sixpoint’s <em>Resin</em>.

<em>Resin</em> is big, hoppy, malt-be-damned liquid gold for lovers of the Humulus lupulus that is perhaps best summarized as the quintessential West Coast IPA/DIPA in all regards but one. It’s brewed and canned in New York City.

The slightly hazy, golden pour is more reminiscent of a lager or a session ale and belies the big beer being released. Pour aggressively and you’re rewarded with big bubbles forming a pillowy white head. This also emancipates a most pleasant aroma dominated by floral and fruity hoppiness noticeable even to a nose that’s a little plugged from this morning’s cold weather road ride. There is a slight dankness and fruity sweetness on the nose, but the aroma hops and the fresh hop dry-hopping are properly contributing to a scent that tells the mouth to be ready for a hop-bomb.

The front of the tongue gets a slight burn from the carbonation that seems to accentuate the bitterness of the fruity and floral hops as these flavors spring forward. You can’t say this beer is light on the malt as attested by the 9.1% ABV, but the malt is overwhelmed by the claimed 103 IBUs. This is in no way a derogatory comment on this beer, as <em>Resin</em> makes no claims to be anything but a celebration of hops and the many ways in which they can influence a beer. What malt the tongue can detect is mid-palate and fleeting. The hops quickly suppress the malt as the aftertaste is dominated by a piney, dank bitterness. Surprisingly, the floral bitterness stays on the front of the tongue into the aftertaste, but as the mouth dries, the pine flavors are highlighted in the long finish.

If you like hops, this beer is startlingly easy-drinking for such a high ABV. Some of my favorite pairings for beers such as this are sharp cheddars and spicy chili dark chocolate bars.

The can designs of Sixpoint make them absolutely perfect for packing for long rides. The slender, tall can packs easily anywhere there is extra room. Take a few of these along on your next cycling adventure. Just remember, hops like it cool, so pick another Sixpoint for warm weather. And if you’re ever lost at sea and come upon an island with the smell of a nicely marbled steak charring on an open flame and the sounds of Thom’s falsetto, stop by and enjoy one of the finest IPAs there is with me.

Cheers and Happy New Year!

Alex
