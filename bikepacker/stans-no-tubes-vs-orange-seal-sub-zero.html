<h1>Stans No Tubes Vs. Orange Seal Sub Zero</h1>
Crested Butte Colorado, is a mountain town in Central Colorado. It&#8217;s a dead end town in the winter, and about a 5 hour drive to Denver. It&#8217;s typical for Crested Butte to get extremely low temperatures, especially when the sky opens up after a storm rolls through. The town sits at about 8,885 feet, and the surrounding peaks reach 12,000+ feet. At night, the cold air sinks to the valley floor, and temperatures quickly dive. The past few weeks we have seen -20s and even -30s over night.

When it gets cold things stop working properly. It&#8217;s tough to motivate when its that cold. Your shifting is slower and your brakes too. Your tire pressure also tends to do weird things when it gets cold. Many of you know the benefits of riding with tubeless tires, less rolling resistance, better overall feel, and lighter weight. But is it worth it when temperatures dip below zero?

Before we get into the comparison. Please note that both <a href="http://www.notubes.com/Sealant-C14.aspx" target="_blank">Stan&#8217;s No Tubes</a> and <a href="http://orangesealed.com/shop/subzero-sealant-refills" target="_blank">Orange Seal Sub Zero</a> sealants are made to work in -20 degree weather. That is why we are comparing the two. The Orange Seal is said to be able to dip to -30, but who would want to test anything at that temperature.

Below is a quick comparison of Stan&#8217;s No Tubes sealant vs. Orange Seal Sub Zero Sealant in temperatures below zero. Please watch the video, and read below for overall conclusions regarding the differences between the two tubeless tires sealants.

After testing the tires in even colder temperatures after this video, we saw that the pressure would drop 2 psi overnight when temperatures reached -10 and below. The same thing happened when we would bring the tires inside, the pressure would significantly increase as the molecules and sealant inside the tube warmed. Not once did the pressure between the two tires actually fluctuate more than .5 psi.

As far as setting up tubeless, this was the big difference. Orange Seal has little pieces of glitter in it and because of this, I think it helps seat and seal the tire more quickly and efficiently. If anything, I would get the sealant for that alone, as it is not all that easy to set up tubeless with fat tires and a small at-home compressor.

In conclusion, there were very little differences between the two sealants, and if I had to use one over the other, I would pick one blindfolded. They both held pressure properly in subzero weather, they did not dry up, and they sealed to the tire nearly the same. One thing we can&#8217;t comment on is how the sealants react with punctures in cold environments, yet. We will report when that does happen. We just cant justify poking holes in expensive fat bike tires.

One of the biggest differences is price. Stan&#8217;s No Tube Sealant will run you $16.99 for a 16oz bottle. While the Orange Seal SubZero Sealant will cost you $21.99 for a 16oz bottle.
