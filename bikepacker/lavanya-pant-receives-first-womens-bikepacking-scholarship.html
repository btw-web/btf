<h1>Lavanya Pant Receives the First Women&#8217;s Bikepacking Scholarship</h1>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE &#8211; 11/21/16</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Advocate Cycles, Revelate Designs and the Baja Divide team are excited to announce Lavanya Pant as the recipient of the <a href="https://bajadivide.com/scholarship/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">“Lael’s Globe of Adventure” Women’s Scholarship for the Baja Divide</span></a>. Born in India, raised in Australia, and currently living and working in Tokyo as an English teacher, Lavanya has recently discovered and engaged a growing passion for bicycle travel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She is a student of several languages, in addition to her native Hindi, Urdu, and English, and has a dedicated interest in global cultures with a degree in anthropology. But her life wasn’t always focused on pedaling a bike in distant lands as she has only recently regained a passion for riding. </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lavanya first discovered the freedom of the bicycle in her youth, in India. She recalls, “I taught myself to ride on my neighbor’s bicycle in New Delhi when I was 10.” Lavanya relied on a bicycle for basic transportation through some of her school years in Australia. In 2012, her partner Alistair lent her a 3-speed Raleigh 20 and she enjoyed her first overnight ride. Her interest grew from there. She speaks candidly about herself:</span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">The following year, we built a Surly Disc Trucker. I was suddenly so much faster and capable of riding dirt, but still unable to keep up with Al and his friends.</span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">Frustrated but inspired, I started a girls riding group called <i>The Winona Riders</i>. I was surprised at how many women were interested in riding and traveling by bike.</span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">In July 2015, Al and I quit our jobs and bought a one-way ticket to Denmark. We rode dirt and pavement from Copenhagen to Athens. I got a real taste for riding dirt in France, Montenegro and Albania and want to progress to riding desert roads and more technical trails.</span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img loading="lazy" src="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1.png" alt="lavanyapant1" width="4096" height="2726" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16552" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1.png 4096w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1-300x200.png 300w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1-768x511.png 768w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1-1024x682.png 1024w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1-83x55.png 83w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1-2000x1331.png 2000w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1-800x532.png 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1-300x200@2x.png 600w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1-768x511@2x.png 1536w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1-1024x682@2x.png 2048w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1-83x55@2x.png 166w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1-2000x1331@2x.png 4000w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant1-800x532@2x.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 4096px) 100vw, 4096px" /></span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">Now, I live and work in Tokyo and commute as much as possible and ride into the mountains on weekends.</span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">Another important reason  is the thrill of feeling supported and rewarded for adventure. Earlier this year I was in India, where some people did not approve of my bike travels. It was seen as irresponsible and rebellious. These attitudes are not surprising but hurtful and discouraging nonetheless. My younger female cousins were most supportive and I feel grateful for them.</span></p><p class="p4"><span class="s1">A scholarship that supports women in doing what they love and giving them a platform to share those experiences will have a domino effect in inspiring courage and creativity in more women.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">To our knowledge, the “Lael’s Globe of Adventure” Women’s Scholarship for the Baja Divide is the first women’s bike travel scholarship ever to be offered. “The moment I thought of the idea to offer a women&#8217;s bike scholarship,” Lael Wilcox says “we wrote to Tim Krueger at Advocate Cycles and Eric Parsons at Revelate Designs with our scholarship proposal. They both responded immediately with their support.” This scholarship was offered to “a woman of any age who possesses an interest in international travel and global cultures…and is willing to share her ride on the Baja Divide through writing, photography, visual art or music”. Exactly two hundred applications were received from all over the globe.<img loading="lazy" src="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2.jpg" alt="lavanyapant2" width="4096" height="3070" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16551" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2.jpg 4096w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2-768x576.jpg 768w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2-73x55.jpg 73w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2-2000x1499.jpg 2000w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2-800x600.jpg 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2-300x225@2x.jpg 600w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2-768x576@2x.jpg 1536w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2-1024x768@2x.jpg 2048w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2-73x55@2x.jpg 146w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2-2000x1499@2x.jpg 4000w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LavanyaPant2-800x600@2x.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 4096px) 100vw, 4096px" /> </span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lavanya plans to ride the Baja Divide route beginning in early February on an extra-small <a href="http://advocatecycles.com/product/seldom-seen/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">Advocate Cycles Seldom Seen</span></a>.
