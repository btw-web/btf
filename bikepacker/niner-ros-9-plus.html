<h1>Niner ROS 9 Plus</h1>
After our recent return from Interbike, I had a dream about <a href="http://www.ninerbikes.com/" target="_blank">Niner bikes</a>. Although this dream was a bit over the top, I woke up thinking about adventure. It put in perspective the way companies like Niner are going about their business. I have never been big into Niner, not because I have something against them, but more so because there are endless options out there, and I have not made it around to them.

Luckily for me, I was properly introduced at the dirt demo at Interbike. I was excited to check out the new ROS 9 Plus, Niners first dab at a plus size tire bike. Niner takes pride in building frames around the 29” geometry. They took a big leap introducing their gravel friendly mountain bike, the RLT 9 last year, and maybe an even bigger leap introducing the ROS 9 Plus this year, but both bikes still maintain their 29er concept.

Built around a similar geometry of the ROS 9, Niner adjusted the yoke and bridge to allow 29&#8221; x 3.0&#8221; tires on the ROS 9 Plus. The steel frame is built to last, made out of 4160 CromMo. Niner also manufactured their own 15mm thru steel fork, claiming it as the first steel tapered fork available. Maybe more interesting is the fact that the ROS 9 Plus was built with a suspension fork in mind. Even looking at the geometry on their website will show the change in geo between the ridged fork and a 100mm fork. Maybe their friends over at MRP have something cooking?

The ROS 9 Plus comes with <a href="http://www.ninerbikes.com/biocentric" target="_blank">Niner&#8217;s Biocentric II</a> bottom bracket. An eccentric bottom bracket which is an alternative to adjustable dropouts. Instead of adjusting tension on your dropouts, the Biocentric bottom bracket spins creating more or less tension. Once you have the proper tension you tighten down the bottom bracket by way of two 5mm Bolts.

The beautiful matte green ROS 9 Plus comes in one model at a somewhat affordable price point of $2,900. Niner built the bike around a bit more of a playful geometry, with shorter chainstays and a 69.5 degree head tube angle. The bike comes with a complete Sram X1 driver and Shimano Deore M615 brakes. The ROS 9 will also come stock with the new Stans 52mm Hugo hoops, and we believe with Surly Knard tires. Niner, 780mm bars, stem, and seatpost round out the bike.

The ROS 9 Plus is a perfect bike for your next adventure, the mid fat 29+ concept gives bikepackers the ability to &#8220;Roll Over Shit&#8221; (hence the Ros acronym) like big rocks and baby heads. It makes conditions like mud, sand, and even snow a bit more manageable. Its capability of rolling is far superior to its fat bike brother. Although we are waiting for a specific carbon 29+ bike, we understand that steel is real&#8230;strong, and a great use for an adventure bike. The large frame holds plenty of options for a frame bag.

We did notice there were only two rivet nuts for one cage located on the down tube. They also went without fender and rear rack mounts. After chatting with them, they wanted to keep the frame clean, and realize that there is no need for racks with the type of saddle bags now available. It was interesting to hear.

<a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_5573.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4302" src="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_5573-1024x768.jpg" alt="ROS 9 Plus" width="702" height="526" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_5573-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_5573-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></a>

Niners brand alone is a reason to ride their bikes. Talking to a handful of the crew a Niner, their passion for building bikes around their needs and desires is the way bikes should be designed. The names of all their bikes are acronyms for a unique cycling phrase for example, ROS = Roll Over Shit, pretty cool. They are also huge advocate for IMBA and each year make a custom build that they auction off, with all proceeds going to IMBA. This year they made a pretty sweet looking ROS 9 Plus and raised $40,000.

Niner took a leap, but kept it simple. With very few mid-fat bikes currently available, there is seemingly plenty of interest out there. Between the aesthetic, concept, and brand, Niner and the ROS 9 Plus should be a great bike to test out and should see plenty around.

Head to your dealer now for more info and to preorder your ROS 9 Plus.
