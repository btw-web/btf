<h1>2015 Salsa Bucksaw</h1>
Looking for a fat bike with all of the capabilities of a high end trail bike?  Look no further. Salsa Cycles has done what they do best with their 2015 Bucksaw full-suspension fat bike. I was more than happy to have the opportunity to bounce around on this playful toy at the dirt demo yesterday.

<strong>Specs</strong>

The Bucksaw features Salsa&#8217;s Split Pivot rear suspension technology and RockShox Bluto fat bike suspension fork. There are two variations of the 2015 Bucksaw.  The Bucksaw 1 boasts higher end components and the Bucksaw 2 is just a step down on the drive train and a few other elements. The Bucksaw 1, coming in a beautifully flashy transparent blue, comes equipped with a SRAM XO1 drivetrain and a SRAM X1 30 tooth chainring. The handlebars are Salsa Rustler 1 carbon handlebars coming in at 740mm wide. For brakes, the Bucksaw 1 comes stock with the SRAM Guide RS break system. Finally, a notable addition to the Bucksaw 1 is the RockShox Reverb Stealth seatpost.

<strong>Geometry</strong>

Salsa thoughtfully built this bike around the concept of 4&#8221; tires and how they interact with the ground below. You can absolutely tell when you ride it. They have intentionally built the frame and fork around a 26&#8221; x 4.0&#8221; tire profile &#8211; there is no compatibility for the bike to fit a 29+, or even wider tires such as the 4.8&#8221; Surly Bud or Lou.  The Bucksaw frame has a 67.6 degree head tube angle, a 17.4 inch chainstay length, and a 121mm PressFit bottom bracket.  It has thru-axles at both ends and a front axle spacing of 150mm x 15mm, while the rear is 177mm x 12mm.

<strong>The Ride</strong>

I will start out by saying this is by far the most playful mountain bike I have ever had the pleasure of riding. Yes, I said mountain bike. Although the Bucksaw is most definitely a fat bike, it handles no differently on the trail than your average full suspension mountain bike. Salsa covered all of their bases when designing this bike. They have eliminated any issue of auto steering which can be very common on fat bikes. This bike rips corners and floats over rock gardens like a dream. Unlike other fat bikes I have ridden on singletrack, the Salsa Bucksaw has some of the best traction when it comes to cornering and climbing. It is shockingly nimble and responsive. The wider bars and shorter stem make for excellent handling as well. Needless to say, I came off of this bike with a huge smile on my face.

<strong>Bikepacker Friendly?</strong>

The Salsa Bucksaw rides like a mountain bike, however, feels more like a couch than a wooden stool. For a comfortable ride for the long distance, with space for bags, this bike would be excellent for bikepacking.  It holds up to rock gardens, descents, and sustained climbs like a champ.  Of course, with a full suspension bike, you do loose a bit of frame bag space, and that would be the only downfall to of bike when it comes to bikepacking.
