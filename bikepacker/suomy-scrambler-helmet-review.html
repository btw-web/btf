<h1>Suomy Scrambler Helmet Review</h1>
Suomy designed their Scrambler helmet for trail or enduro riders who are looking for a lightweight, adjustable, comfortable helmet with increased protection on the lower portion of the back of the head.<br /><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4546/38362117101_fac042459f_o.jpg" width="4912" height="3264" class="alignnone size-large" /><br /><h3>Introducing Suomy</h3>Suomy is an Italian company, well-known in the motorcycle industry. They have been making helmets since 1997, but if you are strictly a cyclist, you may not have heard of them yet because they have only been making cycling helmets for the last couple of years. Suomy has focused on high quality products with their stylish Italian fashion enveloping the results of their obsession in <a href="http://www.suomysport.com/en/company/research-development.html">research and development</a>.<br /><br />They currently have 7 different lines in their range of cycling helmets: Road Racing, Road, Fast-Road, Enduro &amp; MTB, Downhill, Crono, and Roller-Skate-BMX.<br /><br /><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4528/26587979959_498c773fdf_o.jpg" width="4912" height="3264" class="alignnone size-large" /><br /><h3>Unboxing the Suomy Scrambler</h3><p>The Scrambler comes in high-quality packaging that complements the helmet well. While most helmets come in a box that has an open portion for the consumer to touch the helmet without sliding out the cardboard sled that the helmet sits upon within the box, Suomy has prevented this which keeps the helmet from getting dusty and keeps it looking new, even if it has been on the shelf for months. Sure, it&#8217;s a subtle detail, but it&#8217;s one that makes an impression on you from the very beginning and prepares you for the quality that you are about to experience. <br /><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4204/34744059092_4f2abb66ef_o.jpg" width="339" height="226" class="alignnone" alt="" /><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4272/34775472401_b287e1b5d4_o.jpg" width="339" height="226" class="alignnone" alt="" /><br />The helmet has a high quality look and feel that is superior to most helmets on the market in the $100-$200 range. <br />The first thing I noticed was the graphics on the polycarbonate outer shell of the helmet. The black and white swooping shapes with silver pin-striping and Suomy &#8220;red dot&#8221; logo on the visor (or &#8220;adjustable peak&#8221; as Suomy refers to it), all look very much motocross inspired. <br /><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4561/38333342452_519376bd0d_o.jpg" width="4912" height="3264" class="alignnone size-large" /><br />While this look isn&#8217;t bad, it isn&#8217;t really my style as I have become a fan of solid colors, more common to the MTB community in recent years.  This particular colorway is the &#8220;Black/White&#8221; in the &#8220;S-Line&#8221; style (Model #C1SC000). It is one of three colorways in the S-Line style, the other two are Red/White and Blue/White. My favorite style of the Suomy Scrambler is their &#8220;Mono&#8221; style series. The Mono series Scramblers are offered in either black or white and they are solid colors with minimalistic graphics. The last style of Scramber helmets are the &#8220;Desert&#8221; series. There are 6 different colorways available in the Desert series. While all the Desert style colors look great, they have a large Suomy logo on the top of the helmet that is not subtle enough for me to prefer it over the other two styles. All three styles are the same Scrambler helmet, just different aesthetic designs.<br /><a href="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24493469298_cc9b624eed_k.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24493469298_cc9b624eed_k-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="770" height="512" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20641" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24493469298_cc9b624eed_k-1024x681.jpg 1024w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24493469298_cc9b624eed_k-300x199.jpg 300w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24493469298_cc9b624eed_k-83x55.jpg 83w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24493469298_cc9b624eed_k-2000x1329.jpg 2000w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24493469298_cc9b624eed_k-800x532.jpg 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24493469298_cc9b624eed_k-1024x681@2x.jpg 2048w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24493469298_cc9b624eed_k-300x199@2x.jpg 600w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24493469298_cc9b624eed_k-83x55@2x.jpg 166w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/24493469298_cc9b624eed_k-800x532@2x.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></a><br /><br /></p><h3>Scrambler Features</h3>This helmet has a lot of great features that have it well positioned as a top choice for many trail riders.<br /><ul><li>Made with in-molding technology</li><li>Outer shell made of polycarbonate, inner shell EPS Canalized Polystyrene</li><li>Adjustable Peak removable visor with 2 screws for varying tension</li><li>2 sizes available: XS-M (52 &#8211; 58cm, 20 1/2 &#8211; 22 3/4in) or L-XXL (59 &#8211; 62cm, 23 1/4 &#8211; 24 3/8in)</li><li>Lightweight Technology: 280g for S/M, 290g for L/XL</li><li>25 ventilation holes designed for channeling the airflow towards the back</li><li>Removable/Interchangeable chin strap</li><li>Removable and washable anti-bacterial, anti-odor, hypoallergenic padding</li><li>Biaxial, micrometric, one-handed, size adjustment system</li><li>SMC System (Suomy Minimum Contact System), which creates a gap between the head and the helmet, guaranteeing maximum comfort</li><li>Adjustable rear fit system with 3 horizontal settings</li><li>Lower protective ring along the bottom edge of the helmet</li><li>Helmet bag included</li></ul><figure style="width: 4912px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4246/34744062012_bfed8152c8_o.jpg" width="4912" height="3264" class="size-large" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Biaxial retention system</figcaption></figure><br /><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4563/38307390476_97b6ddcbe1_o.jpg" width="4912" height="3264" class="alignnone size-large" /><br /><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4560/38366952671_9dbf1f28aa_o.jpg" width="4912" height="3264" class="alignnone size-large" /><br /><h3>Scrambler Trail Testing</h3>The Scrambler fits more comfortably than any helmet I have worn. I have tried on many helmets and purchased ones that fit with less-than-ideal contact with my head. It seems that helmets tend to hit the top of my head on the sagittal crest of my skull. Some are very uncomfortable, while others are bearable, but it is rare to find a helmet that does not have some contact with this part of my head. The Scrambler is lightweight and I did not notice it much, if at all over various ride lengths. It fits well with my Halo headbands or without. It fits without interfering with my Jawbreaker or Jawbone sunglasses. <br /><a href="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/18839888_10155380910934776_2998699802567564661_o.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/18839888_10155380910934776_2998699802567564661_o-1024x752.jpg" alt="" width="770" height="565" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20249" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/18839888_10155380910934776_2998699802567564661_o-1024x752.jpg 1024w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/18839888_10155380910934776_2998699802567564661_o-300x220.jpg 300w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/18839888_10155380910934776_2998699802567564661_o-75x55.jpg 75w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/18839888_10155380910934776_2998699802567564661_o-2000x1468.jpg 2000w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/18839888_10155380910934776_2998699802567564661_o-800x587.jpg 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/18839888_10155380910934776_2998699802567564661_o-1024x752@2x.jpg 2048w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/18839888_10155380910934776_2998699802567564661_o-300x220@2x.jpg 600w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/18839888_10155380910934776_2998699802567564661_o-75x55@2x.jpg 150w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/18839888_10155380910934776_2998699802567564661_o-800x587@2x.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></a><br />The Scrambler is light enough for me to justify racing with it, even on my non-enduro rig. Although Suomy listed 290g for the L/XL helmet that I tested, the sticker inside the helmet had it as 310g. Worse still, it measured out to 355.0g on my scale (30g less with visor removed). Still a very respectable weight, but too misleading in my opinion. <br /><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4520/26592465689_16cce29b08_o.jpg" width="4912" height="3264" class="alignnone size-large" /><br /><br />One improvement I think could be made fairly easily is to replace some of the white or silver accents on this helmet with reflective silver for night riding visibility. I do not see any reflectivity on this helmet, and while most mountain bikers may not find this to be a selling point, I ride roads on some sections of 90% of my rides where I live in San Diego, whether it is to get back home, or to get back to my vehicle.<br /><a href="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23467042_10155561306635622_5011762075108052481_o.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23467042_10155561306635622_5011762075108052481_o-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="770" height="433" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20642" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23467042_10155561306635622_5011762075108052481_o-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23467042_10155561306635622_5011762075108052481_o-300x169.jpg 300w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23467042_10155561306635622_5011762075108052481_o-98x55.jpg 98w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23467042_10155561306635622_5011762075108052481_o-800x450.jpg 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23467042_10155561306635622_5011762075108052481_o.jpg 1440w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23467042_10155561306635622_5011762075108052481_o-300x169@2x.jpg 600w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23467042_10155561306635622_5011762075108052481_o-98x55@2x.jpg 196w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></a><br />The visor has adjustable tension screws on both sides that allow it to be pretty immovable, or very loose, or you can remove it altogether. One issue is losing these screws. I had one back out somewhere along the way and I cannot find it. It&#8217;s not a problem as the visor has enough inherent friction to stay put in multiple positions, but it would be nice to be able to clamp it down with these screws. I plan on purchasing replacement screws that are available for <a href="https://www.ciclista-america.com/store/pc/viewCategories.asp?idCategory=33">$8.99 for a pack of four</a>. Speaking of replacement parts, Suomy sells replacement visors (&#8220;Peak&#8221;), liner pads, and micrometric adjuster system. <br /><img loading="lazy" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4520/38361770751_c4e20e8780_o.jpg" width="4912" height="3264" class="alignnone size-large" /><br />This helmet has served me well this summer. It is well ventilated, lightweight, comfortable, and has 3/4 size, enduro-style extra protection on the base of the skull. It could have slightly more protection near the ears and a little lower towards the base of the skull, but I think it would be less comfortable and less compatible with sunglasses. Simply put, it feels closer to wearing nothing at all than any other helmet I would depend on for trail riding.<br /><br /><span>MSRP: $149.99  &#8212; $174.99  </span><a href="http://www.suomysport.com/en/">www.suomysport.com</a>
