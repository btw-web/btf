The Tripster ATR v2 adds through axle compatibility, internal routing, revised titanium tubing, compability with 700c and 650B wheels and a revised geometry.

<br />Kinesis have accompanied the release of the Tripster V2 with a video featuring comments on the allure of adventure from Tour Divide record holder and Transcontinental organiser and brand ambassador Mike Hall, shot recently in Wales. If you missed our interview with him after the Tour Divide, <a href="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/mike-hall-tour-divide-champion/">check it out here.</a></span></em></p><hr /><p><em><span></span></em><span>Partridge Green, Sussex, November 18<sup>th</sup> 2016</span></p><p><span>Sussex based Kinesis UK have today launched the second generation of their popular Tripster ATR titanium adventure bike. The original Tripster ATR, which stands for Adventure, Tour, Race, was an early mover in the trend towards drop bar bikes capable of being ridden across a wide range of terrain. Launched in 2012, the titanium Tripster became one of Kinesis’  best -selling models. The strength, durability and ride quality of titanium combined with large tyre clearances and a geometry that worked well in a wide range of riding conditions, helped it become a popular choice for adventures large and small.</span></p><p><span>The Tripster ATR v2 is an evolution of the original frameset albeit with a significant number of changes. There’s a new custom titanium tube set, featuring an increased gauge on the down tube and a flattened off section of the top tube. Kinesis say this allows frame bags to sit more securely on the new bike whilst also making it more comfortable to portage.  Additionally, there’s a new rear triangle design, incorporating flat mount disc brakes and a new switchable rear dropout system that gives owners the choice of running 12 x 142mm through axle that come as standard, or a more traditional 9x135mm for QR.<br /><br /><img loading="lazy" src="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image001.jpg" alt="Kinesis Tripster ATR v2" width="1228" height="819" class="aligncenter wp-image-16512 size-full" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image001.jpg 1228w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image001-300x200.jpg 300w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image001-768x512.jpg 768w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image001-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image001-82x55.jpg 82w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image001-800x534.jpg 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image001-300x200@2x.jpg 600w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image001-82x55@2x.jpg 164w" sizes="(max-width: 1228px) 100vw, 1228px" /></span></p><p><span>New internal routing accomadates brake and shifter cables/ hoses/Di2 wiring inside the frame. Kinesis say this reduces water or mud ingress whilst improving shifting reliability. There’s also a 3<sup>rd</sup> bottle cage mount under the down tube to give more options for bike set up and carrying capacity.</span></p><p><span>Tyre clearance is increased on the Tripster ATR v2. It’s now possible to run up 45mm 700c tyres (or 40mm with mudguards) but it’s also possible to run 650B wheels with 2 inch MTB tyres. To accommodate these changes, Kinesis have also released a brand new straight blade, full carbon, tapered 12mm through axle fork called the  ATR for the <a href="http://www.kinesisbikes.co.uk/Catalogue/Forks/Adventure/ATR-DISC-FORK" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&#038;q=http://www.kinesisbikes.co.uk/Catalogue/Forks/Adventure/ATR-DISC-FORK&#038;source=gmail&#038;ust=1479571239244000&#038;usg=AFQjCNEOa5NusoI4QDl77SsHXbv0m6v9pg">Tripster, available separately</a> for £279.99.</span></p><p><span>Kinesis say that they’ve taken extensive feedback since the launch of the original ATR including noticing the trend that many people are increasing the amount of technical riding they’re doing on drop barred bikes.</span></p><p><span>Bruce Dalton of Kinesis told us “Right from the beginning in 2012, the Tripster surprised us with how popular it was and how much people enjoyed building them and riding them. They’ve always been fun to ride, capable and tough and people have taken them on some amazing adventures all over the world, like adventurer Ed Shoote from <a href="http://welovemountains.net/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&#038;q=http://welovemountains.net/&#038;source=gmail&#038;ust=1479571239244000&#038;usg=AFQjCNEgdQeQAQhicEfLkW9A8UMpFExJ2g">We Love mountains</a> . We’ve given the Tripster a thorough re-design for this new V2 model. Customers and our ambassadors were telling us they wanted an even more capable and versatile bike to help them do more adventurous riding but with all of the qualities they loved about the original. We’ve worked long and hard on making the v2 an even better bike and we’re really pleased with the end result”.</span></p><p><span>The new Tripster ATR v2 is <a href="http://www.kinesisbikes.co.uk/Catalogue/Models/Adventure/Tripster-ATR-V2" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&#038;q=http://www.kinesisbikes.co.uk/Catalogue/Models/Adventure/Tripster-ATR-V2&#038;source=gmail&#038;ust=1479571239244000&#038;usg=AFQjCNEd7yN52rfkNb36-OW0WOXcsAflPg">available to order now as a frame only for £1849.99</a>, with early stock already presold to Kinesis dealers. </span></p>
