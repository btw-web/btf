<h1>Honey Stinger | Sting or be Stung</h1>
I don&#8217;t think that there is a bikepacker out there that doesn&#8217;t struggle with finding the perfect, well rounded snacks to fuel their adventure. There are countless brands out there ranging from start ups to the big guys.  It&#8217;s all about reading nutrition labels and comparing snacks to find the one with the most calories, caffeine, protein, and sodium, while still tasting good and being easy on your stomach. It may be often forgotten, but in addition to the nutrition label, you also want to assure yourself that you are going with a brand that you trust. After all, anything you put into your body these days is either fighting disease, or feeding it. <a href="http://www.honeystinger.com/" target="_blank">Honey Stinger</a> is an honest company that we trust.

The idea behind honey fueled energy foods began way back in 1954, when Ralph and Luella Gamber came forward, years ahead of their time, with the EN-R-G Bar. The EN-R-G Bar was their way of developing something different than all of the candy bars on the market, while using all natural ingredients, including honey.  The use of honey came natural to the Gambers as Ralph was a beekeeper by trade. Dutch Gold Honey, founded by the Gambers in 1946, is now the largest family owned honey company in the US.

In 2002, EN-R-G Foods, Inc was re-established with the same values in Steamboat Springs.  Honey Stinger is now a successful company providing honey-based, natural ingredient energy foods to the masses.

Being confident in the brand values, we were excited to have the opportunity to fuel our summer with Honey Stinger. We had the pleasure of testing the trusty Organic Waffles, Organic Energy Chews and the Classic Gold Energy Gel. There is one stand out characteristic to note about Honey Stinger products, they make you feel good! No crummy stomach or raw tongue from artificial sweeteners.

<strong>The Gel: </strong>

The Classic Gold Energy Gel is essentially a packet of pure honey. Quick natural energy. The Gold flavor contains 95% honey, and is certified gluten free. The gel packed a punch, even though it was non caffeinated. Honey is known for its effectiveness in instantly boosting the performance, endurance and reduce muscle fatigue of athletes. The glucose in honey is absorbed by the body quickly and gives an immediate energy boost, while the fructose is absorbed more slowly providing sustained energy. With the gels being 95% honey, they are a perfect supplement for bikepackers.

Honey Stinger has also introduced a line of organic energy gel&#8217;s, which are a blend of organic tapioca syrup, organic honey and electrolytes. Both the organic and the classic lines are certified gluten free. Depending on the flavor, the gel may or may not contain natural forms of caffeine. Each packet contains 100 calories, 50 mg of sodium, 85 mg of potassium and 27 grams of carbohydrates.

<strong>The Waffles: </strong>

Best Honey Stinger bikepacking breakfast? A Gingersnap Organic Honey Stinger Waffle with a packet of Justin&#8217;s Almond Butter spread over top. YUM. There are few things better than waffles. For an energy food company to perfect a waffle in the form of a flat, gooey, honey-packed treat &#8211; well, this makes us happy.

There is no other company on the market who is creating a product like this that is certified organic and comes in a single serving wrapper. These waffles are perfect for packing. The wrapper holds no air, and they can literally be slid in to your bags anywhere. 4 or 5 waffles stacked are still less wide than a Cliff bar. If they crumble and fall apart, well, we can assure you that they still taste delightful. Each waffle contains 160 calories, 55 mg of sodium, and 21 grams of carbohydrates.

<a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/chews.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-5222" src="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/chews-1024x922.jpg" alt="honey stinger" width="550" height="496" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/chews-1024x922.jpg 1024w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/chews-300x270.jpg 300w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/chews.jpg 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a>

<strong>The Chews:</strong>

These chews have saved us from feeling over fatigued on many rides this summer. Our favorite thing about these chews? They aren&#8217;t as large and sticky as some of the other chews on the market. They don&#8217;t stick to your teeth, and more importantly, you don&#8217;t feel like you are swallowing a lump of half chewed goop.

The Honey Stinger Energy Chews are certified organic, and were developed specifically for health-conscious people in mind. Honey Stinger confirms that these are the only chews on the market to feature &#8220;naturally occurring fiber and protein derived from 100% tapioca syrup and honey.&#8221; The two caffeinated flavors, Lime-Ade and Cherry Cola, have proved to keep the sleep monster at bay for countless hours during the Colorado Trail Race this year. These chews are tasty, and even eating just a couple at a time, instead of the whole pack, will give you that burst of energy you need. Each serving (one packet) of chews contains 160 calories, 80 mg of sodium, 40 mg of potassium, 39 grams carbohydrates, 1 gram of fiber, and 1 gram of protein. The caffeinated flavors contain 32 mg of caffeine per packet from white tea.

Honey Stinger products are a staple in our bikepacking snack pack. An energy food brand that has a focus on serving natural ingredients and organic products is alright in our book.
