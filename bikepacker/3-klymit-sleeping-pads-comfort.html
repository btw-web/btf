<h1>3 Klymit Sleeping Pads for Ultralight Comfort in the Backcountry</h1>
Kylmit is a breakthrough company specializing in outdoor gear solutions while helping you save weight and stay comfortable.

The decision of what to bring bikepacking to keep you comfortable while saving weight can be an uphill battle. Kylmit has developed a number of technologies to ensure that weight and comfort are no longer an issue for you. The two technologies that are used in the following three sleeping bags are both the Loft Pocket and Body Mapping Technologies.

<a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tri_2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5577" src="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tri_2.jpg" alt="Kylmit" width="800" height="594" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tri_2.jpg 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tri_2-300x222.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>

Klymit cuts the fat by removing strategic sections of the sleeping pad called Loft Pockets. These pockets allow your sleeping bag to be puffy beneath you and capture the full warmth of your sleeping bag &#8211; whether the sleeping pad is below, or inside of your sleeping bag. The Loft Pocket technology gives you more warmth than a bulky insulated sleeping pad at a fraction of the weight.

Kylmit sleeping pads ensure the maximum comfort, even if the pad is only ¾ long. They are so sure of this because they use Body Mapping technology. They design their sleeping pads based on human anatomy. The pads follow the contours of the body to give you support where you need it.

<h3><b><a href="http://www.klymit.com/index.php/products-1/sleeping-pads/outdoor/inertia-x-lite-orange.html" target="_blank">Inertia X-Lite</a></b></h3>
<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5578" src="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xlite_3.jpg" alt="Klymit" width="800" height="532" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xlite_3.jpg 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xlite_3-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

If you are looking to go as light as you can while still carrying a sleeping pad, then listen up. The <a href="http://www.klymit.com/index.php/products-1/sleeping-pads/inertia-x-lite-orange.html" target="_blank">Inertia X-Lite</a> is the lightest ¾ sleeping pad on the market. Coming in at 6.1 ounces, the pad is designed to give you comfort where it’s necessary, and cut out the extra materials. The narrow pad pumps up easily in a few breaths, and packs down smaller than a beer can.

In our tests we noticed a few things. First of all, it&#8217;s as light as a feather. If you are hesitant on packing a pad on your next overnighter or bikepacking race, just throw it in your frame bag, you wont notice it and it will likely benefit your sleep. Once you do plan on using it, the pad is quick to pump, which will get you sleeping that much quicker. The valve itself is very simple, and locks to ensure it holds all night. With Klymit&#8217;s Body Mapping technology, it is very comfortable as long as you sleep on it properly.

<a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xlite.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5579" src="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xlite.jpg" alt="Klymit" width="800" height="578" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xlite.jpg 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xlite-300x216.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>

You can sleep on your back or side, however there is not much room for error while moving up and down or side to side. Large gaps in the center portion of the pad can prove to be uncomfortable if you shift up or down.  The pad worked well when sandwiched between a bivy and the sleeping bag. The pad is 42&#8243; x 18&#8243; x 1.5&#8243; and comes with squeeze pump to maximize pressure, repair kit and stuff sack. The pad is made of a 75D Polyester bottom, and a 30D top.

<h3><a href="http://www.klymit.com/index.php/products-1/sleeping-pads/outdoor/inertia-x-wave.html" target="_blank"><b>Inertia X Wave</b></a></h3>
<a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xwave_2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5580" src="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xwave_2.jpg" alt="Klymit" width="800" height="532" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xwave_2.jpg 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xwave_2-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>

Maybe the perfect compromise between their ultra light Inertia X-Lite and some of their full length pads is the <a href="http://www.klymit.com/index.php/products-1/sleeping-pads/inertia-x-wave.html" target="_blank">Inertia X-Wave</a> ¾ length pad. This beautiful red pad comes with a built in pillow and side rails, and strategically placed waves that make this 10.6 oz pad my go to for bikepacking adventures.

Because the pad is so wide, it offers plenty of comfort whether you&#8217;re on your side, back or stomach. I tend to toss and turn, and having a sleeping pad be comfortable in all 3 positions is important. Even with this relatively thin 1.5in pad, bottoming out the pad is non existent. The X-Wave comes with 4 loft pockets, to cut weight while keeping your sleeping bag efficient. Unlike the X-lite, my hips never found the loft pockets.

<a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xwave_one.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5581" src="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xwave_one.jpg" alt="Klymit" width="800" height="532" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xwave_one.jpg 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/xwave_one-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>

It took about 3 breaths to blow up the pad, and the lock valve kept the air in all night. A built in V pillow situates your head nicely while giving you some extra padding. The bag fit in my bivy, but because of its width It did restrict movement a little. The pad is just as easy to uninflate as it is to inflate. There are two valves on the pad on either side of the top. One for inflating with your mouth, and the other for inflating with a provided hand pump which can be used to reach maximum pressure. The valve that is to be used with the hand pump can also be used to release air. This too proves to be helpful to get all the air out when folding up. The pad is 48” x 25” x 1.5” and packs down to the size of a beer can, and comes with a nice stuff sack, repair kit and hand pump. The X wave is also made of a 75D Polyester bottom, and a 30D top.

<h3><a href="http://www.klymit.com/index.php/products-1/sleeping-pads/inertia-o-zone.html" target="_blank"><b>Inertia O Zone</b></a></h3>
<a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ozone_pillow.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5583" src="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ozone_pillow.jpg" alt="ozone_pillow" width="800" height="532" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ozone_pillow.jpg 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ozone_pillow-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>

The <a href="http://www.klymit.com/index.php/products-1/sleeping-pads/inertia-o-zone.html" target="_blank">Inertia O Zone</a> is a full length, super plush backcountry sleeping pad. For those of you who like to travel light, but don’t wish to sacrifice comfort by using a minimalist ¾ length pad, this product should draw your attention. With an integrated 4’’ pillow, and ample room for tossing and turning, the O Zone will provide comfort on the most harsh platforms.

Using the loft pocket profile technology, I found comfort and warmth in most all positions while sleeping on a solid rock ground. There were very rare occasions where I was sleeping on my side and felt the pressure of my hip hitting the ground below. This could have been because I am shorter, at 5’ 6’’, and was not positioned correctly on the pad.

<a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/interiaozone.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5584" src="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/interiaozone.jpg" alt="klymit" width="800" height="532" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/interiaozone.jpg 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/interiaozone-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>

The pad is very quickly to inflate, maybe 6 breaths.. The pillow and the main pad have separate inflation valves so that you can opt out of inflating the pillow if need be &#8211; although I am not sure why you would do that as it was very comfortable after a day of leaning over the handlebars. This also allows you to make the pillow as firm or soft as you wish. Coming in at 12.5 oz, the Inertia O Zone packs down to the size of a tall boy PBR can &#8211; a  3’’ x 6’’ stuff sack. Very small for a full length pad with a pillow. The O Zone is made of a 75D Polyester bottom, and a 30D top. Lastly, the stuff sack also includes a field repair kit.

Inertia O-Zone: $99.95
