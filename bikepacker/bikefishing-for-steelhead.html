<h1>Water Cycle: Bikefishing for Steelhead</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by the 71% of the planet covered by water, <a href="https://www.blackburndesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Blackburn Design</strong></a> created </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water Cycle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new film project. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">River</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is being released today as the first chapter. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this chapter, we follow Brian Ohlen, an avid fisherman and hunter from Montana.  Brian also has a passion for cycling and he combined the two by loading his waders, tackle and rod onto a bike to go in search of Steelhead along the rivers on the Pacific Coast from Canada to Mexico.  The best Steelhead fishing happens to be in the dead of winter.  Brian faced nearly constant rain, snow and ice for a chance to spend but a moment with one of these elusive creatures.  Along the way, he found some beautiful quiet moments and the simple joys that life on a bike can bring.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The goal of this project is to recognize how important water is in our lives, especially as recreationalists. Brian’s trip is only one example. Active stewardship is necessary to preserve water and our access to it,” says Robin Sansom, Blackburn Design’s Director. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public access to rivers and streams is important. As Ohlen states in the film, “if we ever lost that access or lost our public lands, it would be the death of the West.” Blackburn has partnered with</span><a href="http://www.backcountryhunters.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Backcountry Hunters &amp; Anglers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help protect public river access. Visit the</span><a href="http://www.backcountryhunters.org/stream_access_now_pledge"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Stream Access Pledge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information.<br /></span></p><p><b><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhRpPqSqJxk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br /><br />Creative



</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">River was directed by Dominic Gill of Encompass Films.  In 2006 Dominic bought a tandem bicycle, a heavy video camera and a plane ticket to the northern tip of Alaska. From there he spent two years pedaling south, inviting random strangers to join him on his tandem as he documented the journey on video. In 2009 he helped create an award winning one hour special about his journey entitled &#8216;Take A Seat&#8217;, and subsequently wrote a book of the same title. Since then he has blossomed into a talented film maker, has always been a fine human being and is a natural fit for this project.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Vernor, a noted film maker and photographer, is providing art direction for the entire project.  Brian has long been a Blackburn collaborator and will be making certain that each story in the project has a distinct point of view, while still holding close to the overall theme and vision.  Look for more talented film-makers to create the upcoming chapters of Water Cycle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris McNally provided the amazing illustrations.  G.C. Johnson &amp; Acoustic Labs created the score.</span></p><p><b>About Blackburn</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1975, Jim Blackburn looked at the at the emerging cycling culture and knew he could make a difference.  That meant thinking from the end-user perspective, showing respect for materials and their functionality, while offering purpose-built design and innovation. Over the years, Blackburn has adopted and honed those principles to build quality gear that allows people to go further, do more and be better prepared for everyday and extraordinary adventures alike.
