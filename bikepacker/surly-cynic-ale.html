<h1>Surly Cynic Ale</h1>
Hailing from the extremely bicycle friendly Minneapolis, Minnesota &#8211; Surly Brewing is a true grass roots, from the ground up brewery.

<strong>History</strong>

Like many craft breweries popping up around the country, Surly began with an individual who was an accomplished and obsessed home brewer. In 2004 after deciding he wanted to take his home brewing to the next level, the founder and owner of Surly, Omar, decided to purchase a larger brewing system. He proposed the idea of starting a brewery to his parents and his wife who all encouraged him to &#8220;Go for it!&#8221; His parents had a family owned abrasives company &#8211; and Omar&#8217;s plan was to convert the abrasives business to a business of beer. He hired a fellow highly trained local brewer, Todd Haug, to join him in converting an abrasives factory into a brewery.

The conversion was a success to say the least. By February 1st, 2006 Surly distributed it&#8217;s first kegs of Surly Furious, their critically acclaimed IPA. Omar himself had made many sales calls to bars and restaurants around the Minneapolis area and watched spit out beer samples. They weren&#8217;t ready for what Surly was dishing out, a hoppy, rich, craft IPA. It took a while for Minneapolis establishments to catch on, but they have definitely come around.

The Surly Cynic(ale) is a beer in their main rotation, and there is a reason for that. A Belgian style saison/pale ale which mends old style french malted barley, English oats and Belgian yeast &#8211; this beer is a crowd pleaser.

<em><strong>&#8220;Beer for a glass, from a can.&#8221; </strong></em>

From the store, this beer will always come in a 16 oz can, meaning it is perfect for an after-ride libation. However, if you have a chance to drink a Cynic on tap or pour it into a pint glass &#8211; the flavors will not disappoint! Surly uses lively Slovenian hops to provide floral, apricot and peach notes &#8211; finishing with honey and black pepper flavors.

Surly Cynic will pair well with savory cheeses, peppered meats, citrusy veggies and desserts.
