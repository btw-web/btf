<h1>Pedaling Past The Pain</h1>
I&#8217;m a Pastor, so by occupational hazard, I have a high stress job. Bearing the constant load of others has an inevitable affect on you over the long haul. I love what I do. I&#8217;m very passionate about helping broken people find new meaning to life. Our church is growing and I have a wife and four beautiful children. To say that I stay super busy is an understatement. To make the context greater, we homeschool all of our kids. Now, here&#8217;s where my bike enters the story.

Several years ago I was absolutely burned out. I found myself losing interest in everything. At home, I could barely get out of bed. Our church secretary was a marvelous &#8220;cover&#8221; for me as I could rarely even take a phone call. My emotions were all over the place. I couldn&#8217;t carry on a conversation without breaking down. It made me an angry family man. I would smile in town. I still preached with enthusiasm and I hid my utter misery of depression. I found myself parking my car in the middle of the day and sleeping for hours in the parking lot of a convenient store.

After a horrible year of absolute denial, I hired a Life-Coach. He was very helpful on a number of levels. I made lifestyle changes and began to see tremendous recovery. However, there was always a nagging in my gut that I was missing something. I began exercising like crazy and even created a 3 part intense video series for people to get healthy. I had started walking extreme distances to raise money for charities that I believed in. It was out of my comfort zone because I&#8217;ve never played sports or expressed any athleticism. But, it was in July of 2013 (17 months ago) in a staff meeting that it was casually brought up that &#8220;you should raise money riding a bike.&#8221;<a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1276.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6240" src="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1276.jpg" alt="IMG_1276" width="800" height="800" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1276.jpg 800w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1276-150x150.jpg 150w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1276-300x300.jpg 300w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1276-133x133.jpg 133w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1276-224x224.jpg 224w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1276-431x431.jpg 431w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>

I was 37 years old, busy as a bumblebee, outwardly successful but still trying to evade the feelings of failure and frustration that depression had brought upon me. That week, I bought a 40lb single speed bike for $150 and rode 10 butt-numbing miles. I decided that I&#8217;d train enough to put together a charity ride to raise money for local victims of sex-trafficking. After 2 weeks of daily upping my mileage, I began reading everything I could get my hands on. The hook was starting to be set&#8230;.deeply. Within 2 months I had upgraded to a real carbon road bike and the full kit. I even nervously started using clip-less pedals.

With a few guys in the church, I took off after only 2 1/2 months experience and rode 800 miles through 3 states in 6 days. That&#8217;s all it took. The solitude and peacefulness of pedaling all day seemed to bring healing to my mind and freedom to my soul. I was eating more, sleeping soundly and thinking clearly. To make a very long story short, the bike brought me back to life. I tell folks, &#8220;Jesus saved my life and cycling made me live.&#8221; My new hobby quickly turned into intense training and for my 1 year cycling anniversary, I raised $22,000 for our church by riding my bicycle completely across the country in 10 days flat. During this time of emotional healing, I was told that I should watch a movie called &#8220;Ride The Divide.&#8221; I watched it with absolute amazement. What most people consider an adventure in torture and impossibility, I saw as incredibly motivating and truly inspiring.

I bought an expensive mountain bike and once again began logging ridiculous miles. What&#8217;s interesting is that the longer the ride, the greater I operate. It&#8217;s been rightly said that, &#8220;endurance athletes are running from something&#8221; &#8211; Yes! That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s all starting to make sense. The more I suffer, the farther I go, the more loneliness I endure, the more extreme elements I conquer, the farther I pedal myself away from the emptiness and anxiety that has a tendency to seize my mind and cripple my mobility. I&#8217;m still high strung. I still love my calling, stress and all. However, my bike, well multiple bikes, have become a soothing relief that bring purpose to my pain.

I&#8217;m now signed up as an official racer for the 2015 Tour Divide. This will be my very own gift to myself for my 2 year anniversary of riding a bike. I&#8217;m already in full-blown training mode. I don&#8217;t know how it will end but the daily passion to be ready for something so immense has become my new normal. Whether I win, lose or barely finish, it&#8217;ll be an extraordinary journey that continues to shape me into a man on a mission to leave behind the dark days of depression. I&#8217;m a better husband, father, pastor, and individual because of the raw freedom that a bike brings me. I&#8217;ve got a lot to learn and I look forward to those I can gain wisdom from. Pedal on friends, pedal on.
