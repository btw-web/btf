<h1>Jorden Wakeley &#8211; 2015 Arrowhead Ultra Winner</h1>
Jorden Wakeley recently took first place in the 2015 Arrowhead Ultra after winning the sprint finish with a time of 15 hours flat. Here is what he has to say about the ride and his future plans.

<strong>Where do you live?</strong>
<em>Grayling, MI</em>

<strong>How old are you?</strong>
<em>24 years young</em>

<strong>When did you start biking?</strong>
<em>Ridden a bike all my life, 1st mountain bike race @ age 14. Got my 1st fatbike when I was 21.</em>

<strong>We have seen your name in the fat bike race scene a bunch in the past few years, is this your area of focus?</strong>
<em>It is. I&#8217;m a huge fan of the 29+ movement too, but I love racing a fatbike year round.</em>

<strong>Why did you choose to race the Arrowhead Ultra this year?</strong>
<em>After talking to Todd McFadden at the 2013 Birkie about his AH expirence, it sounded like such an awesome race. I had too much going on with other races last year to commit, but decided to give it a go this year. My whole season has been molded around &#8217;15 AH.</em>

<strong>Tell us what it was like up front, we saw a picture leading into Melgeorges with 6 of you guys, who was all there?</strong>
<em>Being mostly a XC racer, I was actually wondering when the pace would get faster. It did get fast at times, but nothing like I had envisioned going into the race. From the Gateway Store checkpoint at mile 35 it was 6 of us together for the next 80ish miles. The group included myself, Tim Berstein, Jay P, Todd McFadden, Kevin Britenbech, and Charly Tri. I&#8217;ve looked up to all these guys the past few years, and being able to ride with them all day was something i&#8217;ll never forget.</em>

<strong>How were you feeling when you got to the last checkpoint? How was everyone else looking?</strong>
<em>I was feeling great. Jay P and I left the checkpoint together, but were picked up by Todd and Tim a few minutes later. The 3 others were still looking good also, but I was confident about my sprint capabilities if it came down to that.</em>

<strong>What happened in the final mile?</strong>
<em>The final mile was actually pretty calm. </em><em>We all kinda rode our own lines. I kept an eye on each of the others and listened for the clicking of shifters of someone trying to go for it early. About 150 yards out Jay P went for it. I stayed on his wheel and launched at the base of the final short climb and got by. I never looked back because I knew it&#8217;d be close.</em>

<strong>Did you surprise yourself with the win or was this your goal?</strong>
<em>It was definitely a goal to win. I was very confident in my training and abilities going into the race.</em>

<strong>Borealis bikes have been serious player in two recent Winter Ultras (Andrew K / Fat Pursuit /Yampa), how do you like your Echo?</strong>
<em>I love the Echo. I swapped out the Bluto for a rigid fork and put a longer stem on it for AH. It actually rode very similar to the Yampa in my opinion.</em>

<figure id="attachment_6806" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6806" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image-3.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-6806 size-full" src="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image-3.jpeg" alt="Photo: Adrienne Gillespie" width="700" height="700" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image-3.jpeg 700w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image-3-150x150.jpeg 150w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image-3-300x300.jpeg 300w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image-3-133x133.jpeg 133w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image-3-224x224.jpeg 224w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image-3-431x431.jpeg 431w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6806" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Adrienne Gillespie</figcaption></figure>

<strong>What bags were you using and why? How heavy did your bike weigh?</strong>
<em>I used a Revelate Tangle frame bag and Viscacha seat bag. I&#8217;m pretty minimalist so I was able to pack all my mandatory gear and race food in them. I didn&#8217;t weigh my bike, but I know it was the heaviest rig in the top 5, over 42 lbs for sure. I don&#8217;t have carbon wheels, so I ran Clownshoes with tubes and Dillinger 5&#8217;s (This setup was also key to winning the race). The extra float I got from the 100&#8217;s made it so I didn&#8217;t work nearly as hard as the others in the soft snow.</em>

<strong>A lot of people do the arrowhead and other winter ultras to qualify for the ITI, any plans for that?</strong>
<em>ITI has been floating in my head the last few weeks, more so now that AH is over. Maybe next year if I can get the funds/support together. More winter ultras for sure though.</em>

<strong>We have heard you are trying to head over to Colorado to race, is this still the plan and why Colorado?</strong>
<em>It sounded good at the time, not so much now. I&#8217;m happy with Northern Michigan. There&#8217;s never a shortage of snow, and there&#8217;s a fatbike race every weekend in the winter. The fatbike scene in the Midwest is exploding right now, I love it!</em>

<strong>What do you have lined up for the summer, any interest in bikepacking races or rides?</strong>
<em>This summer will include several NUE 100 milers and 3-4 hour point to point races all on a 29+ and/or full fat setup. I&#8217;ve got plans for a long ride from waaaay up in Michigan&#8217;s U.P., to my house, about 350 miles sticking to dirt as much as possible on my fatbike. There&#8217;s not a whole lot of bikepacking races in my neck of the woods.</em>

<strong>Any one you want to give a shout out to?</strong>
<em>My family, friends, Borealis Fat Bikes, Wolf Tooth Components, Twin Six, 45 NRTH, and Einstein Cycles for keeping my rig in perfect working order.</em>
