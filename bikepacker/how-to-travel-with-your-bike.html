<h1>How To Travel With Your Bike</h1>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s getting to be about that time where the winter blues are going to set in if they haven’t already. Perhaps you’re just not sure if you can handle one more trainer session in the basement. Maybe you can’t get your hands on a fat bike.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Whatever the case, maybe it’s time for a trip, eh? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>::Searches flights to Chile::</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of the epic stories posted on this site involve a destination that’s not right outside your back door.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the average bikepacker, flying somewhere to ride may seem daunting. Taking your bike along is complicated, and bike rentals are expensive, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This article is all about the best ways to take <i>your own bike</i> with you when go on an adventure. I’ll compare and contrast the different methods, and delineate for domestic versus international travel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I won’t go into great detail about bike rentals, except to say that there’s a great website called <a href="https://www.spinlister.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">Spinlister</span></a> that is like Air BnB for bikes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You select a destination, a person rents his/her bike to you for a specified time, and you pay for it; often, for less than you could rent from a bike shop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You might even make a friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Domestic travel is first up, because there are more options.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will talk about international travel next.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In my humble opinion, the best way to get cross-country with your bike is through <a href="https://www.bikeflights.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">bikeflights.com</span></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Basically, this company has a business account with FedEx, and you’re getting access to those prices, which are <i>significantly less </i>than what you would pay if you shipped FedEx as your humble little self.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They also guide you through the process which is very helpful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How it works: </b>You go to their webpage, fill out details about where you&#8217;re coming from and going to, enter details about the kind of bike you’re shipping, and they’ll give you a cost estimate as well as a delivery time estimate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>You pay for your postage through the site and they e-mail you a shipping label. They give you the option to ship to/from a bike shop, a FedEx store, or have a FedEx pickup arranged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Keep in mind that all pick-ups are through the FedEx business; to my knowledge, there are no BikeFlight dudes running around picking up bikes and packing them up for shipment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You specify the date and time you want to ship the bike and when you want to pick it up. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How it really works: </b><i>You are in control of how you want your bike packaged.</i><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you are someone who doesn’t trust yourself to pack a bike box, you can bring your bike to a bike shop and have them pack it up for you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Likewise, if you don’t trust yourself to put a bike together once you get to your destination, you can have the bike delivered to a bike shop and they’ll put it together for you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><b>You will want to call ahead. </b>You can usually tell pretty quickly if a bike shop is willing to help you in this endeavor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most shops will charge a fee to box a bike; somewhere around $40-$60 USD is common.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You will want to print out your shipping label from BikeFlights before you show up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Give this to the shop as they’ll affix it to the box once they’re finished.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Make sure you give them adequate time to box it up before it gets shipped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You don’t want them to rush your pack job. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the other hand, you may be totally cool with packing your own bike, or at least willing to give it a try!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  The benefits of packing your own bike include</span> using your own clothing or bikepacking/camping gear as padding for the bike instead of that disposable paper/styrofoam/plastic crap that comes with new bikes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This means less stuff you have to carry with you on your travels.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Plus, the price per pound is a good deal once you’re shipping with BikeFlights.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Toward the end of this article, I list some tips for boxing your bike both in the comfort of your own home <i>and</i> in the discomfort of some random FedEx parking lot a few hours before your return flight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Helpful tips: </b>I’ve found that shipping to and from either a bike shop or a FedEx store works well as both are accustomed to receiving large packages. I haven’t tried to schedule a pickup or ship to my house, but it’s an option.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(A bike box would look conspicuous sitting on the stoop, right?)</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can ship freight on Amtrak… this goes for bikes as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you’re riding the Amtrak yourself, you can put your bike on the train… in some regions… sometimes in a box… sometimes without a box.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How it works:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>You purchase a ticket on Amtrak, you look on their website to see if bikes are allowed on your trip, and if it needs to be boxed up or not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On Amtrak’s “<a href="https://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=am%2FLayout&amp;cid=1251621565020" target="_blank"><span class="s2"><b>Special Items” page</b></span></a>, you can view which lines allow walk-on or walk-up service and the cost. If you’re not riding the Amtrak yourself, you can still ship your bike via Amtrak freight, otherwise known as “Baggage Express”.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How it really works (IF YOU ARE ALSO RIDING THE TRAIN): </b>Not every rail line allows bikes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The general rule of thumb is that if it’s a commuter train (think busy East Coast corridor), you can’t take your bike, but if the route is more for long-distance travel or leisure, you can probably take your bike.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To be sure, go to their website and look up your route or check out the “<a href="https://www.amtrak.com/bring-your-bicycle-onboard" target="_blank"><span class="s2"><b>Bring Your Bicycle Onboard” article</b></span></a>; Amtrak will indicate whether or not bikes are allowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walk-on means you walk it on the cargo car yourself, walk-up means you give it to the people at the station before boarding the train and <i>they</i> put it on the cargo car.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I<b>mportant to note &#8211; you still need to reserve a spot for your walk-on or walk-up bike: </b>This is best done when you purchase your ticket; the earlier the better.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve gotten away with doing this at the ticket counter when I showed up, but it’s not the most reliable method. The reason being that there are a limited number of spots for walk-on bikes on the cargo car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also, the cargo car is located toward one end of the train, and the conductor wants to know ahead of time if he/she will need to line that car up with the platform for you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lastly, many of the conductors are not 100% comfortable with this walk-on system yet… it’s just easier if you have all your i’s dotted and t’s crossed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If a train doesn’t allow walk-on or walk-up service, you may still be able to check your bike as a piece of luggage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you go to reserve your ticket online, you’ll be able to see if checked luggage is allowed on the train.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The general rule of thumb is that busy commuter trains don’t allow checked luggage. Also, if you’re making connections on a long-distance train, you’ll likely need to box your bike.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How it really works (IF YOU ARE NOT RIDING THE TRAIN): </b>You will want to find the counter at the train station that says <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=am%2FLayout&amp;cid=1241267371736" target="_blank"><span class="s2"><b>“Baggage Express”</b></span></a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why they call it this, I don’t know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing seems express about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, make sure your bike is boxed and ready for the people at the counter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ll need to fill out some paperwork.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ll need to write your address on the box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  C</span>all Amtrak to find out exact charges as it depends on how far your shipping, but basically it works out to about $0.70/lb. for the first 100 pounds, and about $0.64/lb. for every pound after that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It will be more or less depending on where you’re shipping to and from.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just don’t do it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As an individual, you will pay WAY more than is appropriate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The only reason to do this is if you have no access to the internet, or did zero preparation before needing to ship your bike.</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Shipping to/from bike shops:</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This actually isn’t a bad option if you’re not tech or bike savvy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How it works: </b>Most bike shops will charge about $50-60 to box up your bike.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They usually have business accounts with FedEx or UPS, and they are able to ship your bike for the same cost that BikeFlights would.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On the receiving end, a bike shop may charge $30-50 to build up your bike.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you have more money than time or skill, this is probably the most stress-free way to ship your bike domestically.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How it really works: </b>If you’re someone that doesn’t like when other people touch your bike, this could be very stressful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you usually let other people do the maintenance and repair on your bike, this could be the best option for you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Most bike shops take this task seriously and do a good job. The only down fall to this option is that you usually don’t get to cram as much other stuff in your bike box as you would if you boxed your bike at home (clothes, bags, etc.)</span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Bikes on Buses:</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a lot of bus companies in the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I only have specific knowledge about two major companies in the U.S., which are Bolt Bus and Megabus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How it works: </b>If you’re using Bolt Bus, you can stash your bike in the cargo area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you’re riding Megabus, you can’t. Greyhound will let you carry on a bike as long as it’s in a box, but be wary of inconsistencies with Greyhound personnel across the country. </span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Bikes on Airplanes:</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We could probably devote a whole second article to this option due to varying airline policies and endless amount of packaging options; I’ll try to point you in the right direction without drawing tears of boredom and frustration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You’ll likely want your bike to fly with you if you’re traveling internationally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don’t see the benefit of traveling with it domestically unless you’re a pro athlete and you’re on a time constraint.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How it works:</b> You package up your bike, bring it to the airport, check it as a bike, get charged anywhere between $100 &#8211; $200, and fly with your bike.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The amount charged varies greatly by airline, and policies are constantly changing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can try to mask the fact that you’re checking a bike, but you’ll need to get your bag or box under the airlines specified dimensions such that you’re not overcharged for bringing a bike.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In essence, if your bike can fit in a bag or box that’s small enough, the airline won’t count it as a bike. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>How it really works:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where to start?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could start by saying the rules that most airlines have regarding bikes is seemingly ridiculous compared to the policies regarding golf clubs, snowboards, skis, hockey bags, and so on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could also start by saying that figuring out how to cheat the system will take you a long time, and even after you think you’ve figured out a plan, you could still end up paying the surcharge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most expensive, stress-free option would be to buy a special bike box, and then also pay the surcharge as indicated by your airline.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The next option is to box your bike in a cardboard box and pay the surcharge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you want to get around the airline surcharge, read on.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is really a game of dimensions or disguise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Check out the fine print for your airline.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They’ll give dimensions for bikes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you can get your bike in a protective case that fits or is under these dimensions, you’re golden.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How do you do this?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The options abound.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here are some ideas:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Couplers</span><span class="s1"> &#8211; You can get a bike with couplers, or <a href="http://www.bilenky.com/#!what-is-a-retrofit/c22f8"><span class="s2"><b>get couplers retro-fit</b></span></a> on a bike.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is only worth it if you’re going to be doing a LOT of bike travel.</span></li>
	<li class="li1"><span class="s2">Soft bags</span><span class="s1"> &#8211; You can try to put your bike in a soft, oversized bag with padding such that it doesn’t seem like a bike at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You will want to go with something like the <a href="https://trashmessengerbags.com/#/product/30"><span class="s2"><b>Spack Junk S&amp;S Coupled bag</b></span></a>, which is designed specifically for flying with your bike.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don’t try to to stuff your bike in a hockey bag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Myself and others have had zero luck with that option; usually the bike doesn’t fit and it’s risky from a protection standpoint as it is a soft bag. </span></li>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>International Travel</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">International travel is tough, because your bike will need to go through customs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The rules are different &#8211; almost backwards from domestic travel. <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s actually safer and potentially more cost effective to carry your bike on the plane.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you ship your bike &#8211; even through BikeFlights &#8211; you’ll find that it’s actually extraordinarily expensive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, shipping Denver, Colorado to Rome, Italy costs roughly $280 USD.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To Buenos Aires, Argentina it’s about $800 USD.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even just to go to Calgary, Canada, this will run you about $220 USD.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other thing to consider is having your bike stuck in customs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’ve heard stories of bikes shipped to Canada that have not arrived when expected. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Your best bet is to just figure out the best method for carrying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>it on the plane when traveling internationally.</b></span></p>

<h3 class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Tips for Boxing Your Bike</b></span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Tips for boxing your bike (at home):</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Try to be reasonable with your bike box; don’t make it bulge, protect your hubs, protect your headset.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  F</span>ace your cassette inwards, and put some extra padding underneath your bottom bracket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where points of your bike come in contact with the box (e.g., wheel axle edges, bottom bracket, rear drop-outs), use rigid reinforcement like extra cardboard or books instead of soft things like sleeping bags or clothing that will compress under force.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Use tape to make sure your clothes or other soft padding stays where you want it to stay on the bike during shipment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Tips for boxing your bike (not at home):</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay, you just finished your bikepacking trip.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you decided to save a few dollars by boxing and shipping your own bike. <b>You need to think about physical locations ahead of time. </b>You’ll likely pickup a bike box from a bike shop in town.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do you know how far away it is from a FedEx?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>Look it up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></i>Nothing more awkward than trying to walk or ride several miles with a HUGE box in tow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sort of defeats the purpose of doing this yourself if you pay for an expensive Uber to get you from one place to another.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that might be an option.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Tips for boxing your bike (in the FedEx Parking Lot):</strong> Pickup a box from the bike shop and pack the bike at FedEx.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Try to take your pedals off at the bike shop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you can’t do it with your multi-tool, get the shop to help you with a pedal wrench.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Walk yourself, the box, and your fully rolling bike to the FedEx.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>::fingers crossed for low winds::<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Make sure you have your multi-tool and tape with you to assist with the breakdown of your bike.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, if you have a car at your disposal, you can box up your bike somewhere more comfortable than the FedEx parking lot… but where’s the fun in that?</span></p>
