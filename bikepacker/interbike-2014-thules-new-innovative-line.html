<h1>Interbike 2014: Thule&#8217;s Innovative Line</h1>
In the ideal world, we would all be able to pop out of our front door, and have an array of trails at our disposal. However, in many cases, people must travel to their riding destination. When you are heading our for an important race or bikepacking adventure, it is crucial to know that your bike will be safely transported &#8211; and that you won&#8217;t be dealing with any issues when you arrive.

<a href="http://www.thule.com/en-us/us" target="_blank">Thule</a> was established in Sweden in 1942, and has been making quality products ever since. They have a passion for helping you get to your destination safely, simply and in style. Their more recent brand mission has centered on<em> &#8220;Bring your life.&#8221; </em> They want to make sure that whatever you&#8217;re doing, where ever you are going, and whatever your pursuit, that you can live your active lifestyle at ease.
<h3><em><strong>Thule on a mission</strong></em></h3>
At Interbike 2014, Thule proudly displayed their T2 fat tire compatible hitch mount.  The T2 hitch mount can hold 2 bikes, and up to 4 with their extender kit. These can be all shapes and sizes of bikes &#8211; honestly, how many times have you left your house for a week long road trip and deemed it completely necessary to have two mountain bikes, a road bike and a fatty (maybe even two on the roof).  I know we have! It&#8217;s hard to leave your babies at home, we get it.

In addition to Thule&#8217;s always durable and trustworthy racks and mounts for vehicle transport &#8211; they have expanded their product line to meet all of your needs. They are going beyond what their competition is doing, and taking the idea of bringing your life with you full circle.

The <a href="http://www.thule.com/en-us/us/products/luggage-and-bags/bike-bags-and-racks" target="_blank">Pack n&#8217; Pedal product line</a> by Thule is versatile and fits any ride.  I know we prefer to strap our bags to our bikes via velcro and custom fits, however, lets not forget about those commuting days, or the folks who enjoy riding with a rack system. Thule has created a rear and front rack system that can be modified to fit your bike. They carry both a Sport and a Touring version. Best part? You don&#8217;t even need to have bolts to mount them. These racks work on both the rear seat stays or the front fork of any bicycle &#8211; from a commuter to a full suspension mountain bike. Thule has also created a side frame to secure to their rack systems for attachment of their panniers and totes. Some variations of their bags are coming with Thule Shield, which is their highly reflective, IP64 waterproof, and dust resistant material, featuring a dry bag style closure.

A few other notable items that were on display at the Thule booth were their products that protect electronics. They are making smart phone cases that have the life proof thing down. They have also announced that they will soon be releasing a new line of these for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+.

Need to ship your bike or take it on a plane? No problem. Thule has created multiple bike luggage options that guarantee the safety of your bike while in transit. Yet again, taking their product line full circle.

<a href="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DSC_08601.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4388" src="http://bikepacker.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DSC_08601.jpg" alt="DSC_0860" width="1000" height="665" srcset="http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DSC_08601.jpg 1000w, http://bikepackerprd.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DSC_08601-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a>

To seal the deal, Thule will be extending their Thule Bring It! (lifetime guarantee) to all of their products beginning January 2015 &#8211; truly showing that they stand behind the quality of their products.
