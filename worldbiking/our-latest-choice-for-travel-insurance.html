<h1>Do you really need travel insurance?</h1>
<p>We’ve had travel insurance since day one of our round the world bicycle tour.&nbsp; Being insured is important to us for a couple of reasons.</p>
<h3>Quality Healthcare Costs add up Quickly</h3>
<p>A surprising number of cyclists and travelers we meet choose not to purchase travel insurance.</p>
<p>Their logic is that healthcare in developing countries is not expensive. They believe covering treatment costs out of pocket will not be a major financial burden.</p>
<p>Sure, treatment in a PUBLIC hospital in a developing hospital will be cheap.&nbsp; But we’d like to have the best care possible, and that means going with a private hospital.</p>
<p>Granted, private healthcare in Thailand or Tanzania will be much less than in the US or Europe.&nbsp; But if you’re involved in a serious accident, care costs will quickly skyrocket to thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>We want to be covered in such a case and not be forced to deplete our savings.</p>
<h3>Peace of Mind in Extreme Circumstances</h3>
<p>The need for medical evacuation is rare, but it does occur.</p>
<p>We met a German cyclist who lost control of his bike after hitting a slick spot on the road.&nbsp; He ended up nearly puncturing a lung.&nbsp; The accident occurred in a remote part of China and the cyclist had to be evacuated to Bangkok.</p>
<p>Luckily he had insurance.</p>
<p>Cases like this are rare, but potentially catastrophic if you’re not covered.&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s why we’re insured.</p>
<h2>Our Newest Insurer</h2>
<p>We’ve switched travel insurance companies several times over the years.</p>
<p>Premiums go up significantly as you age and can take a big bite out of your travel budget.</p>
<p>With our new insurer, <a href="http://www.chapkadirect.fr/index.php?action=produits&amp;id=622">Chapka International &nbsp;Backpacker Travel Insurance</a>, we pay a little less than $50 per person, per month.</p>
<p>We like the policy for a few reasons:</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Cycling is NOT excluded as a “dangerous activity.”</h3>
<p>Obviously this is important on a bicycle tour.&nbsp; If you read the fine print, you’ll notice that many policies specifically EXCLUDE cycling and list it as an extreme sport.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Easy Extensions</h3>
<p>The policy can be taken out for an initial period of 90 days and then extended for periods ranging from 3 months to one year.&nbsp; We like this flexibility.</p>
<h3>Great Price, Reasonable Coverage</h3>
<p>The maximum coverage is 200,000 euros (1 million in the USA and Canada).&nbsp; While some policies offer higher limits, we feel this is reasonable.</p>
<h3>Backed by a reputable and respected Underwriter</h3>
<p>Alright, the website design isn’t the most modern and the English version is spotty.&nbsp; But if you dig deeper, you’ll see that <a href="http://www.chapkadirect.fr/index.php?action=produits&amp;id=622">Chapka</a> is backed by <a href="http://www.acegroup.com/">ACE</a>, one of the world’s largest insurance providers.</p>
<p>We feel confident in going with this company as our travel insurance provider.</p>
