<p>The information below about bicycle touring in Africa is <em>outdated</em>.   We cycled here from 2006- 2009.  It is essential to get up-to-date info about safety and security.  Sadly, the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/africa/mo-ibrahim-foundation-africa-rule-of-law/" target="_blank">safety situation in Africa has deteriorated</a> since we cycled there between 2006-2009.  As of early 2017, some countries of concern are Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Burundi, Ethiopia (drought), Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan,  Somalia, Central African Republic (chaos and war), Libya, DRC, Nigeria.  </p>
<p>Check with the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html" target="_blank">US State department for travel warnings.</a>  These are highly conservative in nature, but are an excellent starting point for assessing risks.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, South Africa and Mauritania have become notably more peaceful in recent years.</p>

<td>The scenery around Hombori is truly fantastic and not to be missed. Mali can be a challenging country for cyclists due to the heat, dust, long distances between settlements and often monotonous landscapes.  You may want to do as the locals, and wear a protective mask to keep out some of the particles.  The Gao-Niamey route posed some real difficulties for us, but its in the process of being paved and work should be finished in 2008.  The inland delta region around Massina offers good views of the Niger River and you pass by some spectacular mosques in the Sudanese style.  Depending on the season and the direction you&#8217;re cycling, headwinds can be a real nuisance.  The harmattan blows down for the Sahara from December to February in a north-easterly direction and kicks up a lot of dust and can make cycling extremely unpleasant as well as unhealthy with all that dust being swallowed.<br />There&#8217;s heavy traffic on the main road between Ségou and Bamako with buses roaring by and tooting their horns as a signal for you to pull over on the shoulder.  Otherwise roads are relatively quiet.<br /><a href="http://www.worldbiking.info/log%20for%20website.doc">Our detailed log available here (Word file)</a></td>

<td align="undefined" valign="undefined">Hotels are pricey compared with neighboring Guinea and quite basic for the most part.  in rural areas such as in the Dogon Country or Hombori, you can expect pit toilets and bucket showers and perhaps a few hours of electricity in the evening.  In towns without hotels, the mayor or village chief can usually arrange a stay with a family or in a public building such as a school or training center.  A small payment is usually required.  If you stay with a family, be sure to clear up money issues up front.  We failed to do this in one village, and were asked to pay a whopping 20,000 CFA (30 euros) for pitching our tent next to the stables in a family compound!  Of course we didn&#8217;t pay this ridiculous sum, but the incident left a bad taste in the mouth. On several occasions when no formal accommodation was available, we inquired as to the presence of a local church and were able to camp inside the minister&#8217;s compound or even sleep in the church itself.  We received a warm welcome and had a peaceful night&#8217;s sleep.<br />Street food is plentiful and often quite tasty.  For non-meat eaters, salads, beans, macaroni, yams and omelettes will be the staples.  Fruit is hard to come by in such an arid country, but you should be able to find bananas, guavas, watermelon, oranges and mangoes in season.  Water pumps and taps are often locked as soon as the sun starts to set, and may open late in the morning, so be sure to fill up your bottles when you get the opportunity. Restaurants geared towards tourists aren&#8217;t particularly good value, and outside of major cities, you won&#8217;t find many restaurants catering to locals.</td>

<td>We entered Tanzania from Burundi at the border post of Manyovu.  It&#8217;s a 66 kilometer ride on a fairly rough road from there to the center of Kigoma.  We debated taking the inland route through Kasula, Katavi National Park and on to Sumbawanga, but in the end decided against it.  We were told by expats and locals alike that the road is in extremely poor condition, the region is very desolate  with few villages, there is little traffic (perhaps two vehicles a day) and long stretches with no possibility of finding water.  Tsetse flies are also a problem in the National Park.  One French guy who had done the trip in a 4WD said it took him an entire day to drive 100 KMs.  That said, we were in contact with a Swedish cyclist who did the route so it is possible if you&#8217;re really hard-core.  He said it&#8217;s definitely not easy cycling and he had to resort to getting water from streams.  In the dry season this might not be feasible.</p>
<p>Easier travel is via the MV Liemba which leaves Wednesday afternoon and arrives in Kasanga Friday morning.  A first class cabin costs $62 ($65 if you go all the way to Mpulugu), payable only in US dollars.  Tickets go on sale Monday morning.  When we arrived at the ticket office early Monday morning we were told that all first class cabins had already been reserved.  After a little insisting that we needed our own cabin the ticket agent scribbled our name in the reservation book and sold us the tickets anyway.  Other tourists who arrived the day of departure were also able to get first class cabins.  Decent food is available on board for 2,500 schillings per meal.  The cabins have a sink and a shower is also available, although our fellow tourists complained of the lack of cleanliness&#8211;Amaya found it to be better than a lot of other places we&#8217;d endured.<br />There&#8217;s not much in Kasanga but it&#8217;s a pleasant enough village and there&#8217;s a guesthouse and small restaurant.  There&#8217;s a shortcut between Matai and Mpui, so you don&#8217;t need to go all the way back up to Sumbawanga, as many locals might suggest.  This shortcut road is in good condition, in fact better condition that the main &#8216;highway&#8217; between Mpui and Tunduma.  This is because the shortcut road is narrow so there are no heavy trucks passing that way.<br />Here&#8217;s a rundown of villages you&#8217;ll pass:<br />Kasanga<br />Kawala<br />Kisumba-Kasote: Guesthouse here and small restaurants<br />Limba<br />Mkaowe<br />Mbuza<br />It&#8217;s 67 kilometers from Kasanga to Matai.<br />Matai: try Santa Maria Hotel (it&#8217;s a restaurant) for tasty food from the friendly Rwandan owner<br />After Matai you need to get on the shortcut road.  At the intersection, take a right out of town.  Then a couple more kilometers along this road you&#8217;ll have to take a left towards Munga.  If you keep going straight you&#8217;ll end up in Zambia.  The road is fairly flat and there were no corrugations and not too much sand.    Here&#8217;s the list of villages you&#8217;ll pass:<br />Munga<br />Kalalasi<br />Itegresha<br />Chilesha<br />Kambo<br />Mwazte: Guesthouse and Restaurants, from here there are a couple of roads heading in different directions so make sure you get the road to Mpui&#8211;there&#8217;s a signboard, but you could easily miss it so ask for directions.<br />Musoma<br />Ilembo<br />Mpui<br />From Matai to Mpui it&#8217;s also 67 kilometers.<br />After Mpui there&#8217;s quite a bit of traffic and the road is badly corrugated in some places and there are some sandy spots as well.  You&#8217;ll probably have had enough of the piste when you arrive in Tunduma. Laela (35KMs) and Dalambo (120 KMs) are the only towns between Mpui and Tunduma.

<td align="undefined" valign="undefined">Mozambicans are wonderful, warm people.  Some of the nicest on the continent and they will really go out of their way to help you.  Many people warned us to steer clear of the police who are known to try most anything to get a little cash out of tourists.  We were never hassled by them and always treated with friendliness and respect.</p>
<p>Except perhaps at the Mercado Municipal in Maputo and in some beach resorts, locals will never try to overcharge you at markets.  Mozambicans seem to be very honest people and have not caught on to the idea of squeezing as much money as possible out of tourists.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t find communicating in Mozambique to be a big problem.  Firstly, most everyone speaks Portuguese to some extent and you will be understood if you can speak a bit of Spanish. If you don&#8217;t know any Spanish or at least a bit of French, communication will be much more challenging.  Fortunately, there are also many Africans from neighboring anglophone countries (lots of Zimbabweans and Malawians) living in Mozambique and they always seem to pop up when you need them.</p>
<p>Mozambicans are good communicators and don&#8217;t get blocked with language barriers.  In fact, communication is often easier than in Malawi, where people just don&#8217;t seem to listen to what you&#8217;re saying, and Tanzania, where many people expect you to speak Swahili.</p>

<td>On our way north, we entered Tanzania at Kyela border post and were face with a long 50Km climb up to Tukuyu.  From the Tukuyu the road continues to climb gently up to the Mbeya junction.  From the junction, heading east, the road drops quickly and we felt a real change in temperature and terrain.  Gone was the tropical scenery and tea plantations surrounding Tukuyu, and the scenery became dry and dusty.  The highway linking Mbeya, Iringa, Morogoro and Dar es Salaam is heavily traveled and we found cycling this stretch on the whole unpleasant.  Some sections are very narrow, potholed and trucks and buses pass frighteningly close.  Iringa definitely makes a nice stop along the way.  The setting is lovely and you can spoil yourself with some decent food.<br />The ride through Mikumi National Park is interesting and we spotted lots of elephants, giraffes and zebras even though we were cycling there during the mid-day heat when animals are typically hard to see.  In the village of Doma, a few kilometers after you exit the park if you&#8217;re traveling east, you can find simple accommodation in a quiet guesthouse.<br />The road between Dar es Salaam is paved and in excellent condition.  Once you get outside of the city and its sprawling suburbs, the ride is pleasant with little traffic.<br />The unpaved road linking Bagamoyo with the main highway is in reasonable condition, although a bit hilly at times.  <br />The road heading north to Arusha passing through Korogwe, Same and Moshi has less traffic than the Mbeya Dar es Salaam road.  Although there aren&#8217;t as many lorries, buses still speed past and we had a few close calls.  The road is really quite hilly until you reach Korogwe, where it flattens out a bit.<br />The 35 kilometer climb up to Lushoto is long, but the spectacular scenery makes it all worth the pain.  After about 17 kilometers, you&#8217;ll reach the village of Soni which has some small restaurants and a guest house.  The road actually descends for a few kilometers and then climbs gently to Lushoto.</p>
<p>From Arusha to the Kenya border the road passes through many Masai villages and the land has a stark beauty.  </p>

<p>In Arusha, &#8216;Arusha Pizza&#8217; at the end of the road near the cheap guesthouses does excellent pizzas at reasonable prices.</p>

<td>We entered Kenya at the fast and efficient Namanga border crossing.  There&#8217;s a Forex bureau if you need to change money.  If it&#8217;s closed there will be plenty of men lurking about who will  be glad to do business with you.  We were given a decent rate.  </p>
<p>From Nairobi, we headed towards Lake Navaisha since we had decided not to follow the usual Isiolo-Moyale road into Ethiopia.  We chose, instead to go via the western shore of Lake Turkana.  There is a lot of climbing after you leave the capital, so make sure you get a good start.  We were told to take the &#8216;old road&#8217; to Limuru and then switched to the &#8216;new road&#8217;.  Lorries still pass on the &#8216;old road&#8217; and we were told there were bandits in the forest as well.  There are some security concerns, so its probably best to stick with the &#8216;new road&#8217;.  You&#8217;ll have to climb to over 2,000 meters, but the view over the rift valley is spectacular.</p>
<p>The western shore of Lake Turkana route had been suggested to us by the German guy who runs Jungle Junction in Nairobi.  If you decide to do this route by bicycle, please take care and try to get accurate information on security. </p>
<p>The missions are probably the best source for reliable information because the priests are used to traveling to outlying villages.  We found the police and military to be quite useless at giving advice.  They often have their own interests at heart and may tell you a road is very dangerous and then offer to escort you for an exorbitant fee, just to &#8216;cover petrol costs&#8217; they&#8217;ll say.</p>
<p>If you decide to do the Lake Turkana route, avoid using the more direct route via Marigat, Loruk, Kapedo and Lokori.  We took this route and strongly advise against it.  There are SERIOUS security issues from Kapedo to Lokori.  This 100 kilometers of road is uninhabited. Really uninhabited meaning there are no villages, no people, nobody.  In a couple of spots the road branches and there will be nobody to tell you which road to follow.  I know 100 kilometers doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot, and somebody might be able to draw you a map, but the road is very sandy in spots and the route we took passed through rocky mountains and we had to push a lot.  Plus you never know if the Pokots are lurking around.  They come down from the hills to do scouting missions in order to steal cattle and goats later.  They are not known to harm Westerners, but an unarmed cyclist might just be too tempting.  The villagers in Kapedo did not alert us to these dangers.  It was upon arriving in Kapedo that we were told of the risks.  </p>
<p>So if you want to go via Lake Turkana (some hard cycling but the tribal people are fascinating) you should follow the main road through Kitale up to Lodwar.  The road to Kalekol is paved so that&#8217;s not a problem.  Once you leave Kalekol you&#8217;ve got a couple of options.  The local people often travel directly on the lake front.  Apparently the sand can be quite hard and makes for good cycling.  When we passed, in early November, the rains had destroyed the tracks so this wasn&#8217;t a possibility for us.  </p>
<p>The road is  easy to follow once you&#8217;re on it.  The only difficulty we had was on leaving Kalekol where we took a wrong turn and ended up at a school.  The locals showed us back to the road. Apparently there is another road heading off to your left which goes into the mountains. Don&#8217;t take that one.</p>
<p>There is little traffic on the road.  You probably won&#8217;t see more than a couple of vehicles per day.  Don&#8217;t count on just getting a lift if you&#8217;re fed up with cycling.  Oxfam and Merlin are both working in the area, so you will get some traffic.  Plus the priests and people from the Catholic Diocese travel quite a bit.</p>
<p>There are a fair number of villages where you can get some basic supplies, warm sodas, biscuits and such.   Don&#8217;t count on finding any restaurants or even somebody making tea. The road can be very sandy and you must pass through many (normally dry) riverbeds.  For us, the going was very slow.  Once you reach Omorate, you&#8217;ve got to cross the river.  We hired 3 dugout canoes to take us across, one for us, one for the bags, one for the bikes.  We paid 20 Birr, which was probably a pretty good price. </p>
<p>If you go via Lake Turkana, you must get you exit stamp in Nairobi.   The guys at the border will just take a look at your passport and take down your details in a ledger.  They are very friendly on both the Kenyan and Ethiopian sides.  Ethiopian formalities take place at the immigration office in Omorate (Kelem).  It&#8217;s apparently open 24 hours a day.<br />Here&#8217;s a list of places you&#8217;ll pass:</p>

There is little traffic and the scenery is beautiful.  Be prepared for some long, tough climbs.<br />From Addis we took the main road to Gonder.  From Gonder the road to Sudan is now in the process of being paved.  Most of the way to Aykel is now tar and there&#8217;s another section of tar before reaching  Shehedi.<br />Once you reach the Sudan border, the road is paved.</p>

Another spicy bean-based dish, it&#8217;s always served with fresh bread.  Cost is about 5 birr.<br />Fresh fruit juices are delicious.

A macchiato costs about 2 birr.<br />Cakes look tempting but are usually tasteless and disappointing.<br />Large supermarkets are uncommon.  Shops in Addis, Bahir Dar, Gonder and Arba Minch are reasonably well-stocked and goods are less expensive than in neighboring Sudan.  Shops on Gonders main plaza are very expensive.  Shops on the side streets and in Bahir Dar offer better deals.<br />Lodging is cheap but quality is often very low. Village guesthouses cost between 15-20 Birr. Toilets are often smelly, fly infested pits.  Showers are rudimentary or non-existent.<br />Water is not usually a problem to obtain.

<td>Within a few months, the trials and tribulations of cycling through the Nubian will be nothing but history.  The last 400 kilometer stretch of unpaved road between Dongola and Wadi Halfa is being paved at break-neck speed and if all goes according to plan should be finished by mid- 2009. For now there&#8217;s around 70 kilometers of paved road outside of Wadi Halfa, plus another stretch of maybe 30 kilometers north of Dongola that are tarred.  In many areas the foundation of the road is already in place, so you can ride on a good hard-packed surface. Plus there are a few stretches of road here and there that have been paved.  <br />The downside of all this paving is that the new road no longer passes through all the beautiful villages that line the Nile.  On the new road there are currently no road signs, so it is easy to cycle right past places like Abri without knowing where to turn.  </p>
<p>The road linking Atbara, Karima and Dongola is now entirely paved so this could be an alternative route to the traditional route passing along the Nile.</p>
<p>The road between Wad Medani and Khartoum is very busy and dangerous due to the heavy traffic and lack of proper shoulder.  Between Wad Medani and the Ethiopian border the road is entirely paved and there is far less traffic.</td>

<p>Lodging is really a rip off.  In Dongola the guy was asking 30 pounds for a very basic double room (Lord&#8217;s Hotel) but we got him down to 20 and in Wadi Halfa at the Nile Hotel they&#8217;re asking 7 pounds per bed in shared rooms.  This place is really basic with dirt floors in the rooms&#8211; at least it&#8217;s reasonably clean and the pit toilets not too smelly.<br />Your best bet is camping, certainly not hard to find a place for that in Sudan.  We camped at some government type establishments in towns ( nice because showers were available) and also put up our tent in some of the shelters you find just off the main roads.  These have the advantage of giving you some protection from the wind.  A local family also invited us to stay with them and on two occasions locals opened up empty rooms in towns.  We  were thankful for the warmth and comfort.</td>

<td align="undefined" valign="undefined">Obtaining a tourist visa for Sudan can be time-consuming and expensive.  Getting a 14-day transit visa, on the other hand, is a relatively straight forward process.  In Addis we paid $100($61 for the actual visa and $39 for the application form&#8211;strange system) and after applying in the morning, received the visas the following afternoon.  We presented a letter of recommendation from the French embassy, although this is not mandatory.  A Dutch family applying at the same time had no letter and still received their visas.  You will need two color passport photos, plus a photocopy of the passport photo page and a photocopy of the visa for the country you will be entering after leaving Sudan.  It is mandatory to have this visa (Egypt if you&#8217;re heading north, Ethiopia going south) already in your passport before applying for the Sudanese visa.<br />You must pay for the visas in US dollars.  No local currency is accepted.<br />The embassy in Addis opens at 10AM.  There was a long line when we were there, but foreign tourists are normally treated separately, meaning just wait to the side and you&#8217;ll be let in as soon as the gate opens.  According to the posted opening hours in Addis, the embassy receives visa applications only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  We&#8217;ve heard you can turn up on Tuesdays and Thursdays as well, so why not try your luck.  The staff in Addis can be surly.  This is no indication of how you&#8217;ll be treated in Sudan.</p>
<p>After entering Sudan, you are supposed to register with the police within 3 days.  Apparently the cost for this varies depending on where you register.  We paid 87.50 Sudanese pounds ($40) in Khartoum.  Of course more than three days had passed, but this didn&#8217;t seem to be a problem. We needed to fill out an application, and submit two passport photos plus a letter verifying where we were staying.  In our case the Blue Nile Sailing Club provided us with the letter. They seemed quite accustomed to doing this. The wheels of  bureaucracy turn rather slowly in Sudan, and registering took an entire morning.  The office in Khartoum is located near the American Embassy.<br />If you do decide to enter Sudan on a transit visa and you&#8217;re cycling, most likely you&#8217;ll end up overstaying.  This was our case (11 days too many) but we had no problems leaving the country or at any of the police checkpoints.  Mention was never made of the expired visas.</p>
<p>In order to cross the Nile at Dongola we needed a special permit from the police.  This is just a simple question of going to the police and showing your passport.  Then you&#8217;ll get a piece of paper authorizing you to board the ferry and cross the river.  If you don&#8217;t have this silly piece of paper you will not be allowed to board the ferry.  The manager at the Lord&#8217;s Hotel can tell you where to go.  He will also want to see this paper that the police give you.  Don&#8217;t let him keep it&#8211;as he did ours&#8211;but insist that he make a photocopy for his records.<br />Sudanese are big fans of meaningless documents, but you&#8217;ve got to play along.</td>

<td>Apparently since December 2008, travelers are no longer forced to go by convoy when they follow the Nile River, but you will still be subjected to a fair number of checkpoints and escorts.  Between Aswan and Luxor we were followed (for our own safety) by the Egyptian police on several ocassions and found this highly annoying.  From Luxor we headed inland to the Western Desert.  Although distances between settlements are fairly long (about 200 kilometers on average) finding water was never a problem for us.  There are police checkpoints approximately every 50 kilometers and also ambulance centers known locally as SAFF. The only area where there are no regular police checkpoints is between Bawiti and Cairo.  This stretch was no problem for us because we found some ambulance centers and manned antenna stations.  There is a rest area about halfway between Bawiti and Cairo, but everything is very expensive there and the place is very dirty and depressing.  Of course, it&#8217;s an opportunity to refill your water bottles.  I really enjoyed the ride through the desert, in particular the White Desert near Farafra.  The stretch between Bawiti and Cairo is rather dull and with heavy traffic the riding&#8217;s not so fun.  El Kasr is an excellent spot to rest up for a few days and visit the old Islamic city.   Winds can be a real problem, normally coming from the north and sometimes east.  All in all, I think it&#8217;s worth the extra kilometers to make a detour into the desert.  <br />From Cairo we headed to the Sinai via the tunnel at Suez.  We were expecting a strong tailwind to push us south, but instead got stuck with crosswinds.  The Red Sea Coast is quite developed with lots of resorts dotting the shore.  The ride through the interior to St. Katherine&#8217;s monastery was spectacular and traffic very light.  </p>
<p>Egypt&#8217;s roads are all in good condition and we found the drivers to be reasonably safe.  Except in Cairo which is sheer chaos.  Be sure to allow yourself lots of extra time to traverse the city.</td>

<td align="undefined" valign="undefined">Coming from sub-Saharan Africa, we found Egypt to be a culinary delight even though we only ate at simple fast-food style restaurants.  Food is cheap and shops are well-stocked if in small towns.  For us, the variety was mind-boggling.  In tourist areas you will be regularly cheated.  Charged double or triple for simple things like bread and sandwiches.  Very annoying but exhausting to insist on paying regular prices.Lodging is good value.  In luxor we paid 30 pounds (about 4 euros) for a comfortable room, with attached bath including breakfast, use of the kitchen and internet access.  Here are a few recommendations:</p>
