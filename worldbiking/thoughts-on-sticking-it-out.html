<h1>Thoughts on Sticking it Out</h1>
<p>I hate the feeling of giving up.  You probably do, too.</p>
<p>Yet we all have those throw-in-the-towel days.</p>
<p>During our two and a half months biking around Borneo I’ve had plenty of them.</p>
<p>But I stuck it out.   And I’m glad I did.  I think a quick look at the images below will best explain why.</p>
<p><iframe title="December 29, 2019" width="750" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJ_FO7sfsKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t always enjoy  bike touring on Borneo.  It was a struggle.  The heat, the hills, the palm oil plantations and the deforestation were tough to cope with.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a cycle tourist, then your perseverance has surely been tested.   Here are some of my strategies for sticking it out:</p>
<h3>I give myself permission to be miserable.</h3>
<p>I allow myself to whine, to cry, and to curse the engineers who dreamed up a road with an 18% grade.  I’ve even been known to throw a toddler-like temper tantrum. Sometimes you just have to let off steam.</p>
<h3>I let it pass.</h3>
<p>Wallowing in self-pity is not a long-term solution.  But if you’re hot, hungry and physically drained it’s hard to see past that.   When I want to give up I stop. I eat.   And sometimes I even hop on a truck.</p>
<h3>I consider the conditions under which I will quit.</h3>
<p>Bicycle touring isn’t always sunshine and tailwinds, but it shouldn’t be a constant struggle either.</p>
<p>If you find yourself dreading another day on the bike over a long period of time something is wrong.</p>
<p>Most of us enjoy the challenge of a steep mountain pass and there’s something to be said for sticking it out across the Sahara, the Nullarbor or the Gobi.   Usually I hunker down and plow ahead.   But sometimes the pain and suffering just isn’t worth it</p>
<p>I hit my limit pedaling up a 16% grade climb during a tropical rainstorm on the narrow and busy road between Bontang and Samarinda in East Kalimantan.  We were more than a month into the never-ending  hills of Borneo and I’d had enough.</p>
<p>Hitchhiking to the next town saved my sanity.  “Temporarily” quitting meant I was able to stick it out in the long run.</p>
<h3>I let serendipity work its magic.</h3>
<p>Just when I’m at the end of my rope, I’m often gifted some form of encouragement or respite.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s as simple as a big wave from some cheering kids or an offer of a cool drink or hospitality from a stranger.</p>
<p>On the Borneo ride it came in the form of a guy called Hippo.</p>
<p>After a serious breakdown (bicycles, not mental) he tracked us down, crammed our bikes and gear into his vehicle and ferried us off to his little expat oasis.  Think air-con, hot shower, flush toilet and a swimming pool.  After a couple of days of good conversation and comfortable living we were ready to face the world again.  That’s magical.</p>
<h3>I focus on the ultimate goal.</h3>
<p>Thinking about the end goal helps me stay focused and gain perspective.</p>
<p>What keeps us pedaling across the torturous Ozarks?  We want to cross America.</p>
<p>What makes us push on through the mud and muck of Central Africa?  We want to reach Cape Town.</p>
<p>What keeps cyclists going as they battle headwinds in Patagonia?  They want to reach Ushuaia.</p>
<p>What helps me face another day of hills on Borneo?  I want to cycle every country on the planet.</p>
<p>And the tiny country of Brunei just happens to be situated on the island of Borneo.</p>
<h3>I remind myself  how lucky I am and focus on the joys.</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, I keep on pedaling because I love bike touring.  There’s nothing else I’d rather be doing.  I’m curious about why lies ahead and I’m passionate about exploring the planet.</p>
<p>If not bike touring, then what?</p>
