<h1>Top 5 Reasons to Cycle the Baja Peninsula</h1>
<h4>This is a guest post by Andrew Edmondston-Low.</h4>
<p>When I cycled Baja  California, I rode South from the US border in Tijuana, along the  Pacific coast and then followed the main road the length of the  peninsula to La Paz. The road zigzags from the West to East coasts of  the peninsula, but this way you get a great impression of the varied  landscapes and coastlines.</p>
<p>A real highlight is the Central Desert. I  then did the little loop of the tip to Los Cabos and back to La Paz  where I flew back to Tijuana and home. I rode this long solitary road in  September 2006. It took me 4 weeks to ride 2200km. September is just  about the hottest month to do Baja and not  recommended.</p>
<p>Other months have more bearable temperatures, plus in  December-March time you have the gray whale watching season in the bays  and lagoons around Guerrero Negro, but this is high tourist season. A  hurricane also passed just south of me towards the beginning of my trip,  destroying many of the campings I was aiming for later on my trip.</p>
<p>Fortunately it had no effect on my trip. In fact, it was a blessing,  because sections of the road ahead were damaged, reducing traffic  travelling the length of the peninsula.</p>
<p><strong>Now, the 5 reasons why you should go bicycle touring in Baja California:</strong></p>
<p>1)      <strong>Open Space</strong>.  Much like riding in any desert, the beauty in the solitude and the wide  open spaces is magical. The sky appears to wrap itself all around,  drawing you further and further into its horizon.</p>
<p>The Baja  desert has its own special aura though, with its majestic Cardón cacti  standing over 15m high and scattered everywhere between large rounded  boulders. This incredible scenery then plummets suddenly into the azure  waters of the Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California) where the native brown  pelicans swoop and dive elegantly to catch fish for tea.</p>
<p>The speed at  which one cycles through this landscape, allowing one the time to soak  up all these happenings, means that bicycle touring is the only way to  experience Baja California.</p>

<p>2)      <strong>Camping on the beaches of the Sea of Cortez</strong>.</p>
<p>At the end of a long hard cycle, there’s nothing better than parking up  under a palapa in one of the many white sandy coves along the gulf’s  coast, especially in the Bahía Concepción, and diving into the bath-like  waters.</p>
<p>If you’re lucky, you’ll meet other campers on the beach  preparing a delicious BBQ spread of tacos and local fish caught in the  bay, who are more than welcoming to weary cyclists emerging from the hot  desert to this paradise of tranquillity. Spend a while relaxing here  and beg, steal or borrow a kayak to paddle out to one of the many rocky  islands for even more solitude.</p>

<p>3)      <strong>The Telegraph Road</strong>.</p>
<p>On a number of occasion on the Baja  peninsula, you get to the flat plains that seem to stretch for miles.  Here the road goes as straight as an arrow towards the horizon, often  with an endless line of telegraph poles running its length. Plug Dire  Straights’ Telegraph Road into your ears and enter the zone. It’s a  surreal experience to get your head down and power along with these  man-made objects whooshing by, seemingly endlessly.</p>

<p>4)      <strong>The surprisingly varied towns</strong>.</p>
<p>From crazy Tijuana in the North to a more placid La Paz in the South,  the tacky American spring break-like glitz and glam of Cabo San Lucas to  the old and forgotten about French and Spanish colonial towns of the  central desert, every town you pass through has something new for you to  feast your eyes on.</p>
<p>Sit and relax under palm trees around the lagoon at  the Oasis of San Ignacio and visit the beautiful old Spanish church  built in 1786. Then make sure to stop in the old French colonial town of  Santa Rosalía, check out the bakery and marvel at Gustave Eifel’s  church from the Paris World Expo of 1889.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure to enjoy a  delicious street-side taco from a little corner stall in La Paz and  enjoy the sunset from the promenade as it goes down over the Bahía de La  Paz casting all the moored boats into ghostly silhouettes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1350" title="town" src="http://www.worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/town.gif" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="http://www.worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/town.gif 600w, http://www.worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/town-500x333.gif 500w, http://www.worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/town-195x130.gif 195w, http://www.worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/town-350x233.gif 350w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>5)      <strong>Local hospitality</strong>.</p>
<p>I think this goes without saying almost anywhere you travel in the  world, especially in more rugged and extreme landscapes.</p>
<p>I remember  struggling up this long hill in the late morning heat, to find a little  truck stop selling ice cold Cokes at its top. I never got to buy a Coke,  because the cute old Mexican lady working there was just cracking open a  fresh water melon and offered me half of it.</p>
<p>On another occasion, I  arrived soaking wet and tired from a day of terrible weather (due to a  hurricane further South) in a little hamlet, where this family invited  me in to dry off and relax on their veranda and play dominoes with their  children. Everywhere you stop people come up to you with the same  friendly curiosity to know where you’re coming from and travelling to.  Once, this vaquero (cowboy) even stopped to compare his horse with my  Koga Miyata World Traveller.</p>
<p>I swear there was a slight pang of jealousy  there in his eyes.</p>

<div>His passion for bicycle touring started when he met a Swiss/Dutch  couple cycling the Panamerican highway whilst he was on a backpacking  tour of South America in 2001.</div>
<div>He has ridden two major tours since, one  (solo) the length of the Baja California peninsula in 2006 and one (with his best mate) around Norway and Sweden in 2009.</div>
<div>He also got involved  raising funds for DownRightKenya (<a href="http://www.downrightkenya.org/" target="_blank">www.downrightkenya.org</a>)  and joined the team as they rode through Luxembourg and Germany back in  2008.</div>
<div>Andrew has a passion for skiing and has worked two ski seasons,  one in Sierra Nevada, Spain and one in Laax, Switzerland, and he  regularly organises ski tours for students and business colleagues.</div>
<div>His ultimate dream would be to one day cycle the Panamerican highway from  top to bottom.</div>
