<h2>What went well in 2011:</h2>
<h3>We slowed our pace of travel.</h3>
<p>I’ve suffered on and off from travel fatigue since the very beginning.&nbsp; It’s not so much a physical thing, more a case of sensory overload.&nbsp; Too many new faces, new towns and new experiences.&nbsp; We cycled just under 15,000 kilometers in 2011 which felt about right.</p>
<h3>I spent time with family and old friends.</h3>
<p>While our trip to the USA certainly could have come under better circumstances, I’m glad I got the chance to go home to Montana.</p>
<h3>I gave several bicycle touring presentations.</h3>
<p>This was a good way to connect with like-minded individuals and reflect on our trip.&nbsp; Plus it forced me to organize all our thousands of photos, be creative and stretch a little out of my comfort zone. &nbsp;More importantly, it may have inspired somebody to embrace&nbsp;adventure&nbsp;and set off on a round the world bicycle tour.</p>
<h3>I bought a Kindle.</h3>
<p>I’ve always loved reading and was never able to get my hands on enough books while travelling.&nbsp; Kindle is a great solution.</p>
<h3>I discovered Zumba.</h3>
<p>While we were in Montana, I had a great time doing Latin dance with all the ladies at my mom’s fitness studio.&nbsp; I never thought I’d be one to enjoy dancing so I’m glad I gave this a try.&nbsp; Pure and simple fun and good reminder to give new things a try.</p>
<h3>I connected with fellow cyclists through the A-Z of Bicycle Touring &nbsp;project.</h3>
<p>It has been really inspiring to connect with so many people who share my passion for bicycle touring.&nbsp; I love seeing the world through another cyclist&#8217;s eyes and discovering new places through their photos.</p>
<h3>I spent more time on photography.</h3>
<p>Slowing down meant we had more time for other activities.&nbsp; In the last few months of 2011, I focused on taking more creative pictures and finally got around to uploading photos to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbiking/sets/">our Flickr page</a>.</p>
<h3>I listened to hundreds of hours of entertaining and educational podcasts.</h3>
<p>I have become a true podcast junkie.&nbsp; I love plugging into <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/the-moth-podcast/id275699983">The Moth</a>, <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast">This American Life</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qt55">Crossing Continents,</a> <a href="http://thestory.org/">APM’s The Story</a>, &nbsp;<a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/tag/freakonomics-podcast/">Freakanomics</a>, the <a href="http://travellingtwo.com/category/cycling-trips/podcasts">Travelling Two Radio Show</a> and many, many more.</p>
<h3>I thought more about what I really wanted in life and what brings me happiness.</h3>
<p>Thanks to the Kindle, I was able to delve into several personal development books including <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/"> Chris Guillebeau’s</a> The Art of Non-Conformity, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400042666">Stumbling on Happiness</a> by Daniel Gilbert and the <a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/">Happiness Project</a> by Gretchen Rubin.</p>
<h3>We completed another year riding my bike around the world.</h3>
<p>After almost six years on the road, it’s easy to take this for granted.&nbsp; I don’t want to let this happen.&nbsp; We are incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to see the world, visit amazing places and meet people from every nook and cranny on this planet.&nbsp; Although we cycled through only seven countries in 2011, we pedaled past some of the best scenery of the entire trip:&nbsp; the Andes and the Yukon.</p>
<p>Life on the road has its highs and lows, but there&#8217;s nothing I&#8217;d rather be doing with my life than travelling the world on two wheels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">What didn’t go so well in 2011:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">We weren’t able to complete our circumnavigation of South America.</span></h3>
<p>That was a big blow.&nbsp; Eric’s fully-loaded bike was stolen in Bolivia and we decided that the best course of action would be to re-group in the States.&nbsp; <strong> </strong></p>
<p>I neglected my yoga practice.&nbsp; Yoga invariably improves my mood and my muscles, but this year I somehow let it slide.</p>
<h3>I continued to complain and blame.</h3>
<p>Not much to say here.&nbsp; I get hungry, I get tired, I get annoyed and I turn into a big bellyacher.</p>
<h3>Blogging was inconsistent.</h3>
<p>I love starting projects but following through isn’t my strong suit.&nbsp; I found it tough to maintain our World Biking site plus <a href="http://www.gobicycletouring.info/">GoBicycleTouring</a> while on the road.</p>
<h3>I didn’t make enough effort to stay in touch with others.</h3>
<p>Every year we meet thousands of people.&nbsp; Sometimes we spend a few days with fellow cyclists or hosts from couchsurfing or Warm Showers and a real bond and connection forms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we say goodbye, exchange a few emails and usually that’s it.</p>
<p>Maintaining&nbsp;realationships while on the road takes time but it&#8217;s essential to well-being.</p>
<h3>I sometimes didn’t use my time as wisely as I could have.</h3>
<p>My life is already (at least) half over, and if I want to achieve something worthwhile and lasting with it, I better get a move on.</p>
<p>I endeavor to make 2012 a year of better focus, increased happiness and deeper realtionships.</p>
