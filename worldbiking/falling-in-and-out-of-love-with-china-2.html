<h1>Falling in (and out!) of love with China</h1>
<p>Just like in relationships, it’s also possible start off on the wrong foot when getting acquainted with a country.&nbsp; Perhaps one party doesn’t put forward its best face, and you end up not much liking each other.</p>
<p>So it was with China.&nbsp; We met her at one of her least attractive moments.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Our first glimpse was not of picturesque villages and pastoral farms, rather of blackened buildings, squalid streets and pollution spewing factories.</p>

<h3>Expecting the worst</h3>
<p>It was with low expectations that we boarded the Cosco Star in Taiwan for the overnight voyage back to the Mainland.&nbsp; Taiwan had been, well, fun.&nbsp; China was just plain hard work.</p>
<p>Thanks to the calm seas of the Taiwan Strait, we awoke surprisingly refreshed after our night at sea.&nbsp; There had been no puking outside the cabin during the night, and the toilets and passageways could be navigated without having to watch one’s step.</p>
<p>As we docked in Xiamen and the friendly Cosco Star crew bade us goodbye, I felt energized and optimistic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready to take on China for a second round.</p>
<p>Ready for raw sewage and heaping piles of rubbish.&nbsp; Ready for maniacs behind the wheels of coal trucks &nbsp;edging me off the road.&nbsp; Ready for swarms of scooters weaving in and out, hawkers darting unexpectedly onto the road and feral dogs giving chase.</p>
<h3>My kind of surprise</h3>
<p>Sure, we got some of that.&nbsp; But what we also discovered was a land of almost enchanted beauty.&nbsp; I don’t want to wax too lyrical here, but some of China’s landscapes are stunning.&nbsp; Amazing, awe-inpiring, jaw-droppingly beautiful.</p>
<p>It just takes a little effort to find the magic.</p>
<p>Actually, finding your way anywhere takes a fair amount of effort in China.&nbsp; Roads criss-cross the country like the varicose veins in my over-worked calves.</p>
<h3>Give me space</h3>
<p>After the thick succession of coastal cities, all I wanted was to ride anywhere with a population density lower &nbsp;than that of Manhattan.</p>
<p>We set out in search of Hakka Houses.&nbsp; That is the roundhouses of the Hakka people surrounded by what is reputed to be some of China’s most beautiful rural scenery.</p>
<p><figure style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbiking/"><img title="Hakka House" src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6503930425_2b09726ae2_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Perhaps if we'd spent more time planning, we'd have found more than just one.</figcaption></figure></p>

<h3>Maybe not the best way</h3>
<p>Now, I’ve never been much into planning.&nbsp; A peek at the Lonely Planet for some not-to-be-missed highlights, a cursory review of a few bicycle touring blogs and a brief glance at the map and I’m ready to hit the road.</p>
<p>This approach, needless to say, has its shortcomings.</p>
<p>In the case of the Hakka Houses, the downside is that we managed to stumble upon exactly one Hakka House.</p>
<h3>At least one advantage</h3>
<p>The upside of the lets-not-really-plan approach is that we wandered into some far-flung villages on our quest to find the Hakka Houses.&nbsp; Stunning villages, I might add, where the locals stared in awe at the very presence of two foreigners on bicycles in their remote corner of the planet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most villagers were friendly and our efforts at Chinese (still pretty much limited to Nín hǎo and xie xie…hello and thank you respectively) were meet with appreciative smiles.&nbsp; Others scowled.&nbsp; “Foreign Devils,” they were probably thinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Here’s what it’s like</h3>
<p>In your average provincial market in China, most everything is for sale.&nbsp; You’ll find chicken feet and duck &nbsp;liver sausage for the hungry, hoes and plant seeds for the industrious, ancient remedies for those fretting about their health and everything from hand-knitted slippers to shoddy knock-offs of trendy attire or those in search of clothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m just afraid not many sales took place once we pedaled into town.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody was too busy gawking &nbsp;to think about consuming.</p>
<p>In the countryside, villagers painstakingly tend tiny plots of land.&nbsp; Watering is done note with an intricate irrigation system or even a high powered hose.&nbsp; It’s done by hand.&nbsp; Buckets of water balanced on broad shoulders are brought to distant fields and then sprinkled on thirsty vegetables.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><figure style="width: 343px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbiking"><img class=" " style="border: 10px solid black;" title="curious couple" src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6503374749_1de531d8e5_z.jpg" alt="" width="343" height="512"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Looking forward to running into more of these types of curious and kind locals.</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3>I hope it lasts</h3>
<p>It has been great fun exploring this side of China.&nbsp; A side of China I love.&nbsp; The quaint side where life passes at a slower pace.&nbsp; I’m sure obnoxious China will rear her ugly head soon enough.&nbsp; So for now, I’m making the most of the bucolic beauty that surrounds me.</p>
<p>I’m glad I didn’t give up on China.&nbsp; Let first appearances color the entire relationship.&nbsp; China and I will be together for several thousand more kilometers and I only hope my fondness of the motherland grows stronger with each turn of the wheels.</p>
