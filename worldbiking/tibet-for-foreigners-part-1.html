These ladies are gathering for an evening of folk dancing on the town square.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Independent Tibet travel for foreigners has been officially off-limits for years.  The occasional intrepid cyclist does manage to sneak in, but most who try it get booted out by the ever-vigilant officers of the PSB (Public Security Bureau).</p>
<p>Unwilling to risk potential lock up in a Chinese prison, we opted for the next best thing to an actual ride to Lhasa : a tour in Sichuan’s Tibetan regions.</p>
<p>Cyclists are starting to carve out a well-worn trail from Zhongdian(Shangri-La),to  Xiang Cheng, Litang, Yajiang, Danba, Xiaojin and on to Chengdu.</p>
<h2>Adventure cycling&#8230;Chinese style</h2>
<p>It’s a demanding route.   The road winds its way up one 4,000 + meter pass, only to dip down into a steep and narrow gorge before rising up again for another trek over a mountain top.  This cycle repeats itself for around 1,200 kilometers.</p>
<p>The high altitude valleys are inhabited almost exclusively by Tibetans.  Prayer flags flutter from the roofs of their lavish multi-storey trapezoidal homes.  Old folks tending yaks give a cheery wave as we trundle past and call out a friendly “Tashi Deleg!”</p>
<p>Towns tend to be a mix of Han Chinese (many relatively new to the region, encouraged by their government to resettle in the less populated regions of western China) and Tibetans (who have lived there for centuries).  With the Chinese middle-class mushrooming, tourism is taking off in this part of the country.  We had the unfortunate luck of touring the mountains during Golden Week, China’s seven day autumn break from the daily grind.</p>
<p>Happy families in shiny SUVs tear through the mountains as if they were being pursued by a gang of dangerous Mafiosos.   This, apparently, is their idea of a relaxing holiday.</p>
<p>Suffice to say we had a few tense moments when impatient drivers didn’t like the speed at which we cleared the way for them.</p>
<p>With high demand for hotel rooms, prices can double during Golden Week.  You know what that means.  We spent a lot of nippy nights in the tent.</p>
<h2>Bicycle troubles (again)!</h2>
<p>But I get ahead of myself.  Bike issues nearly brought the tour to a screeching halt before we  conquered even the first pass out of Shangri-La.</p>
<p>It all hinged on my headset.  The cartridge somehow opened up and the bearings came out.  That meant my steering was shot.  Normally, one would simply replace the cartridge.  Problem was, there was none to be found in Shangri-La (paradise it wasn’t).</p>
<p>In the end, a local mechanic jury-rigged a solution.  It held up over the bone-jaring Daxuenshan Pass and I limped into Xiancheng, barely able to control the bike.</p>
<p>Here’s part 1 in pictures of our tales from Touring Tibet for Foreigners.</p>
<p><figure style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/15117533038_1ea61849a5_c.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Shangri-La Rooftops. Sadly, much of the old town burned to the ground in a recent fire. Tourism is way down and the economy is suffering.</figcaption></figure></p>

We had several days puttering around town trying to sort out the headset issue and stocking up on provisions. We ended up stuffing our panniers with a head of cauliflower, some eggplants, boiled eggs tomatoes, garlic, onions, 1 kilo of honey, a jar of peanut butter, several packets of oats, raisins, instant ramen, milk powder, bread and some apples. Ever since some long stints in Africa with meager food options, I&#8217;m vigilant about being well-stocked with sustenance.</figcaption></figure></p>

Amazing selection and dirt cheap. A good-sized cauliflower goes for about 6 yuan ($1) and you can grab a couple of eggplants for about 3 yuan ($.50).</figcaption></figure></p>

It&#8217;s a triple top (3 mini-passes in one go) with the highest point at 4,487 meters. Naturally, I was worried about the altitude. But what really makes Duxuenshan tough is the state of the road. It&#8217;s really rough. Just a bed of massive rocks in some parts. Plus when we passed, it had been raining every day for the past week.</figcaption></figure></p>

My worst fears did not come to pass. Neither of us fell ill due to the altitude and we survived a frigid night in the tent at around 4,0000 meters. And we were able to tackle the passes in spite of all the sh*t we&#8217;re lugging around (those two extra tires and the spare rim really are not essential).  I finally had the feeling we might actually make it through the mountains all the way to Chengdu.</figcaption></figure></p>
