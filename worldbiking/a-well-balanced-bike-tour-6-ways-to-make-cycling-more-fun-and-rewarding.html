<h1>A well-balanced bike tour: 6 ways to make cycling more fun and rewarding</h1>
<p>If you’re holed up in an office somewhere crunching numbers, creating a PowerPoint presentation or answering emails, you might find it hard to believe that bike touring can be anything less than mind-blowing fun and adventure.</p>
<p>Reality check.  Cycle touring, just like every other activity, can get monotonous.  If you let it. It&#8217;s all about balance.  Here are some ways to keep things fresh when you&#8217;re off the bike.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3711 aligncenter" title="life balance" src="http://www.worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/life-balance.jpg" alt="" width="567" height="318" srcset="http://www.worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/life-balance.jpg 630w, http://www.worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/life-balance-500x280.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" /></p>
<h3>#1   Take a class.</h3>
<p>After being on the road for a long time, many cyclists feel the need to switch gears and focus on something entirely different.  Forget about the bike for a few days (or weeks, perhaps even months!).</p>
<p>The main advantage to learning stuff while traveling (rather than at home) is that it’s CHEAP!</p>
<ul>
<li>Spanish immersion for $10 a day in Guatemala.</li>
<li>A $25 Thai cooking course in Chiang Mai.</li>
<li>A complete PADI divemaster course in Honduras for $800.</li>
<li>An <a href="http://www.sivananda.org/neyyardam/yogavacation.html">all-inclusive yoga vacation in South India</a> for $15 a day</li>
</ul>
<p>You just can’t beat those prices.</p>
<h3>#2   Get serious about photography.</h3>
<p>Many cyclists spend a great deal of time documenting their bike tour.  Why not do it well?</p>
<p>For starters, take a look at <a href="http://www.bicyclingaroundtheworld.nl/bicycle-touring-photography-tips.html">Grace and Paul’s photography tips for cyclists</a>.  You might also want to arm yourself with <a href="http://beersandbeans.com/getting-out-of-auto-ebook/">an e-book about travel photography</a>.</p>
<p>Then you’ll need some inspiration and ideas.  Those can be found on Flickr, which is home to dozens of groups featuring bicycle touring photos. Here are just a few:</p>
<h3>·         <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/biketouring/">Bicycle Touring</a></h3>
<h3>·         <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/332148@N24/">Cycle Touring</a></h3>
<h3>·         <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/bicyclenomads/">Bicycle Nomads</a></h3>
<h3>·         <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/bikesouthamerica/">Bicycle Touring South America</a></h3>
<h3>·         <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/bikeafrica/">Bicycle Touring Africa</a></h3>
<h3>·         <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/bikeasia/">Bicycle Touring Asia</a></h3>
<p>A popular way to improve your photography and get disciplined about shooting each and every day is to start a 365 PROJECT.  As the name suggests, you take photos every day of the year and feature one per day on the <a href="http://365project.org/">365 PROJECT website</a>.  Members will give you feedback and offer encouragement.</p>
<p>If you want to see some truly amazing bicycle touring photography, check out <a href="http://365project.org/leananiemand/365"> Leana Niemand’s 365 PROJECT</a>.  That’s what got <em>me</em> inspired to sign up for my own (free) <a href="http://365project.org/">365 PROJECT</a>.</p>
<h3># 3 Watch films from around the world</h3>
<p>After a long day in the saddle, sometimes you just need to zone out.  Why not recover from the  rigors of the road <em>and </em>feed your wanderlust at the same time?</p>
<p>How to do it?  A foreign film, of course.  Peru, Rwanda, Uruguay, Serbia, Iran, Morocco, Colombia, Finland&#8211;you can find films from just about every nook and cranny on the planet by checking out the<a href="http://www.filmmovement.com/filmcatalog/index.asp?FINDBY=Country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Film Movement </a>catalog.</p>
<p>Let your conscience be your guide as to how you get a hold of these films.     Downloading the film torrent from a  file sharing site such as <a href="http://thepiratebay.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pirate Bay</a> is illegal in many places.</p>
<h3># 4 Listen to Podcasts while you Pedal</h3>
<p>Have you got the feeling that your brain is slowly rotting away while your body gets stronger?  Time to do something about it.</p>
<p>Culture, news, politics, travel, cooking, comedy, storytelling—there are thousands of podcasts to choose from.</p>
<p>Some of my favorites are <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast">This American Life</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/outlook">BBC outlook</a>, <a href="http://risk-show.com/">Risk</a>, <a href="http://thestory.org/">APM The Story</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/fooc">BBC From our own Correspondant</a>, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/q/">Q with Jian Ghomeshi</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/">Thinking Allowed</a>, and <a href="http://feeds.themoth.org/themothpodcast">the Moth</a>.  And that’s just a start to all I’m subscribed to.  Give podcasts a try and there’s good chance you’ll become as hopelessly addicted as I am.</p>
<p>*WorldBiking recognizes that listening to podcasts while pedaling can be a dangerous activity.  Only attempt  it on lonely roads with average traffic flow of less than 3 vehicles per hour. A mirror is required gear for use of headphones while operating a bicycle.</p>
<h3># 5 Get Kindled-up</h3>
<p>Already been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eReader-eBook-Reader-e-Reader-Special-Offers/dp/B0051QVESA">Kindle</a> evangelized from friends and colleagues?  Who hasn’t?  I finally converted last year and it’s been well, a life changing experience.  No joke.  Bye-bye best-sellers from the traveler’s book-exchange.</p>
<p>I now read books actually worth reading. For free (and they’re not pirated)!  I keep my kindle in the handlebar bag so I can whip it out during cycling breaks.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a library card issued in the US, you can <a href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/EBook_Lending_Libraries">check out e-books online</a> and download them direct to your kindle.   Doesn’t matter if you’re in Tehran or Tibet.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a library card from an American library, you can always buy e-books on Amazon (but ouch! They can be pricey) or <a href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Free_eBooks">download the classics for free</a>.</p>
<p>Or you can pay for a membership to a US library.</p>
<p>These libraries currently allow non-residents to obtain cards without appearing in person.</p>
<p>The Free Library of Philadelphia ($35/yr)</p>
<p>Fairfax County, VA ($27/year)</p>
<p>Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, NC ($45/yr)</p>
<p>New Orleans, LA ($50/yr)</p>
<p>Orange County, FL ($125/yr)</p>
<p>Brooklyn Public Library ($50/yr)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.prattlibrary.org/services/librarycards.aspx?id=58884">Enoch Pratt Free Library</a> ($50/yr)</p>
<h3>#6 Share <em>your</em> Story</h3>
<p>What made you decide to set off on a bicycle tour?  Did you have a friend who’d cycled around the world?  Did you read about someone’s adventure on-line?  Maybe you attended a talk about a long-distance bicycle tour?</p>
<p>Chances are there was a fellow human being out there who influenced your decision to stop everything and go cycling.  Why not return the favor?</p>
<p>Give talks at international schools, organize an event at a local cycling club or contact service organizations like Rotary and Kiwanis and see if they’re interested in having you speak at their next event.</p>
<p>Giving presentation about your bicycle tour is not narcissistic (or at least it doesn’t have to be).  It’s all about inspiring the next person to live her cycle touring dreams.</p>
