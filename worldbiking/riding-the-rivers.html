<h2>4 Rivers Bicycle Trail from Seoul to Busan</h2>
<p>I followed the link and discovered a bike trail linking Busan (where we’d arrived on the ferry from Japan) to Seoul (where we needed to get to in order to sort out Philippine visas and a new passport for Eric).</p>
<p>Could it really be so easy?  Why hadn’t we heard of Korea’s cycle routes?  We’d checked out a few Crazy Guy on a Bike blogs and only heard about hills (we’d had enough of those in Japan) and heavy traffic.</p>
<p>This bike trail business sounded too good to be true.  But there it was…we could hop on the Nakdonggang river trail just outside of Busan, then we’d switch to the Saejae River trail, after that on to the Namhanggang and finally we’d follow the Han River right into the center of Seoul.</p>

<h2>South Korea: Bicycle Touring at its best</h2>
<p>Our Japan tour got off to a less than auspicious start (note to self: never again cycle heavily populated urban corridors like Osaka-Tokyo).  The rain, heat, humidity and terrifying tunnels had taken a toll on morale.  Korea HAD to be fun.  A nice easy ride along the river ways might be the recipe for rediscovering why we have devoted a big chunk of our lives to two-wheeled travel.</p>
<p>Busan’s a big city.  The metropolitan area has a population of 4.5 million.  The first thing that struck us was the hustle and bustle of city life.  In Japan, things were always pretty sedate.  In Korea, people jostled in the busy markets and sellers called out to potential customers.  Outside the posh shopping districts, the city had a gritty edge to it.  Our kind of place.</p>
<p>Koreans are less shy and inhibited than the Japanese and strangers often come up to chat.  Getting directions poses no problem in such a well-wired country.  EVERYBODY totes a smart phone and they’ll gladly pull up Google maps and point you in the right direction.  And Koreans are CRAZY about cycling.  The whole country has taken up mountain biking with fervor.   On our fully-loaded machines, we almost feel like rock stars at times.  Locals cheer as we pass and shout encouragement such as “you are great!”  Our self-esteem is not floundering.  And, yes, it’s FUN to cycle in Korea.</p>
<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9812112263_d03203827b_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="553" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A safe place to sleep is usually top on the list of a cycle tourist&#8217;s basic needs. Korea probably ranks as our new number one place for ease of camping. These beautiful gazebo-like structures are found all over the country. They are great for camping when it rains ( and boy has it rained since we hit Korea!) Toilet facilites are not quite as nice as in Japan, but still clean and tidy.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9683296863_e6a3f8fd80_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="615" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was our first day riding in Korea through the outskirts of Busan. The bike path was in excellent condition and pretty easy to follow.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9806863574_fd929a982d_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="385" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">90 percent of Koreans live in high-rise tower blocks just like these. Luckily, you don&#8217;t see much of this bland urban scenery when you follow the bike path. In fact, the river rides skirt the cities almost entirely. The only drawback is that you have to pop off the path to find a supermarket. Sometimes it&#8217;s a little tricky finding your way back.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9687051264_64e3efc23d_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="615" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Korean government has invested massively in cycle routes. There are many stretches like this one built right out over the water. The train tracks grip the mountainside and beyond, a busy road chocked with traffic. On the bike path, life couldn&#8217;t be more serene.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9736493221_0fafb3ea81_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="615" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">If you slip off the bike path and wander around any city or town sooner or later you&#8217;ll stumble upon a bustling market. Women display colorful vegetables and the smell of kimchi permeates the air.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9810051655_9b0730b6ed_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="615" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Small towns like this remind me of life in China whereas the big cities have all the glitz of Tokyo. Villages are often inhabited by only the elderly. The younger generation all want office jobs and smart phones.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9810038684_b1e152d29a_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="615" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A lot of farming appears to be pretty small scale and much of the work seems to be done by hand. On one steep section of road we came across a woman who looked to be in her 70&#8217;s hunched over under a large sack of potatoes. She was obviously used to such loads and didn&#8217;t seem to mind the work, but I couldn&#8217;t help feeling a bit sad that younger family members weren&#8217;t there to lend a hand.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9812107426_210f321d4d_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="553" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Those pancake-flat cycle trails didn&#8217;t last forever. A number of short steep climbs left us gasping for breath.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9715683024_1b50927327_b.jpg" alt="" width="554" height="830" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This section offered two options: MTB and Road Bike. Guess which one we ended up on? it was a beautiful ride, but when we were way on top looking down below at the easy option ,a tiny tinge of regret bubbled up.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9736259685_70baa7a7eb_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="615" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Th closer we approached Seoul, the busier the bike route became. There are lots of newbies on the road, like this duo who were attempted their first puncture repair.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9756141291_0ba5f861e7_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="614" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This is the highest point on the ride between Busan and Seoul. it&#8217;s just over 500 meters but the local cyclists all get very excited about &#8216;the big climb&#8217; and whip out their smart phones to commemorate the accomplishment. We thought we better snap a few photos just to fit in with the crowd.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9806860565_5338aa7dd9_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="615" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Naturally, there are temples and all sorts of cultural attractions to visit along the way.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9812111143_803b619182_c.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="432" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">There are lots of nice people to meet, too. This police officer cycled over on our first day just as we were setting up camp in the Busan suburbs. He was very friendly and even decided to turn a blind eye to the fact that we were cooking in the park. In spite of his limited English, he was a great communicator. When we didn&#8217;t understand his English pronunciation he would spell the words. The other shots are of church families who spontaneously hosted us for the night. Really nice people who all spoke excellent English.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9812148986_be670b99b0_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="615" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Before we reached Seoul, there were even a few tunnels to conquer! Not the terrifying kind, these are cyclist only.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9812174253_4bb5e59b9a_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="615" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The riverside bike trails in Korea are even better than I imagined. The only thing missing is that element of adventure. It kind of feels like a holiday.</figcaption></figure>
