<h1>The Best Coastal Cycling on the Planet</h1>
<p>That’s a bold claim to make.  But we believe it’s true.</p>
<p>As any keen touring cyclist will know, there’s stiff competition in the best coastal road category.  Over the years, we’ve had the good fortune to bike some of the most beautiful seaside routes in the world:  America’s Pacific Coast, Australia’s Great Ocean Road, both New Zealand’s North and South Islands, Taiwan’s jagged coast, some of the Thai coast, seven of Indonesia’s islands, Zanzibar, along the Mediterranean and the Aegean Seas and more than a few fine stretches of seaboard cycling in Central and South America.</p>
<p>My intention in ticking off all these destinations is not to turn you green with envy as you wait out the end of a dreary northern hemisphere winter.  But anyone audacious enough to claim to have found the <i>best coastal cycling road on the planet</i> ought to put forward some credentials.</p>
<p>So where is this coastal paradise?  Sulawesi.  The northern coastal road, to be exact, from Toli-Toli to the Gorontalo turn-off where our quiet stretch of road morphs into the far busier and less scenic Trans-Sulawesi Highway.</p>
<p>As far as we can tell, practically no cyclists have biked this road.  Google searches and several hours poking around Crazy Guy on a Bike didn’t turn up a stitch of info.</p>
<p>Our Reise Know-How and Nelles maps showed this route as a secondary road, with many unpaved stretches.  When we sought out local advice, opinions varied.  Some claimed the route was rough and impassable after heavy rains.  Others said the road was mostly paved and in reasonable condition.  Turns out the latter got it right.</p>
<p><figure style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1_12808190253_9da2c36a45_b.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This is pretty much how the road looks most of the way&#8211;fabulous views out over the Pacific and not a car in sight.</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3>So what makes this road so special?</h3>
<p><b>The Real Thing.</b></p>
<p>First off, this is a road that hugs the coast almost a 100% of the way.  Not one of those faux coastal roads that’s actually situated 5 kilometers inland.   The road dips and dives over rocky headlands and pops out into tranquil coves and quiet fishing villages.  Around every twist and turn is another spectacular view out over the postcard-perfect Pacific.</p>
<p>Sunrise is a brilliant burst of pastels and sunset a fiery eruption of crimson and golden hues.  Midday, wispy clouds hang in a wide azure sky, offering little protection from the blazing equatorial sun.</p>

<p><figure style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1_12605712083_0491c35c18_b.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sunset never fails to impress in Sulawesi.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><b>They built a road <i>here</i>???!!!</b><br />
Prior to 2003, locals traveled from one village to the next by boat.  Supplies came via a monthly visit from the government Pelni ship. Just a little more than a decade ago, a narrow road was finally carved along the coast.  Those were some pretty daring (or foolhardy) engineers that traced the route.</p>
<p>Terrain dictates that the road is just about wide enough for two trucks to squeeze by.  On one side, the land drops abruptly into the sea and on the other it juts up into steep mountains covered in thick tropical forest.  Inland areas are completely uninhabited.</p>
<p>In spite of the many villages along the way, the place still feels pretty remote.</p>

When I showed her her image on the screen she broke out into a big smile and shouted Terima Kasih (thank you)!</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><b>Near Zero Traffic</b><br />
Many coastal routes are victims of their own popularity.  You end sharing the road with hordes of holiday makers when you’d rather have paradise all to yourself.</p>
<p>Even worse is when your lovely seaside cycling route is also used as a major transport thoroughfare.</p>
<p>For the moment, traffic is light on the north Sulawesi coastal route.  Most trucks stick to the busy Trans-Sulawesi highway.  That leaves just local traffic for the northern coastal route.  Most people travel by motorcycle.  The well-off travel in fancy SUV’s.  I’ll be honest, here.  These upper-crust folks can be highly annoying.  There were times I was glad I wasn’t packing a pistol.</p>
<p>Drivers of SUVs firmly believe the road was created for their use, and there’s alone.  They blast along with one hand on the horn, scattering dogs, cows, goats, school kids and the odd toddler who’s wandered off from home.</p>
<p>Sadly, these people take a middle finger greeting as a sign of friendliness and wave back excitedly.  Some even pull over to chat.</p>
<p>Fortunately, these King-of-the-Road types are fairly infrequent.  Mostly it’s just you, the big blue sea and a beautiful ribbon of road.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1_12671324894_5fdde75dde_b.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p><figure style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1_12670771833_17c5699bb5_b.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was was one of the rougher, tougher parts of the road. The guy on the motorbike pushed me part way up this steep climb and then insisted on going back to give Eric a hand. His kindness really made our day.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><b>Undiscovered by the Masses</b><br />
You won’t find any exclusive holiday resorts or even backpacker beach hostels in this part of Sulawesi.  With the road being upgraded to asphalt, that may change quickly.   But for now, this place is untouched by tourism.</p>
<p><b>You are so Fascinating</b></p>
<p>Given the fact that practically no foreigners make it this far off the beaten track, I guess it’s no surprise that the locals go absolutely wild at the simple sight of somebody with a big, pointy noise and fair hair.</p>
<p>The stares are unabashed.  The requests for photos non-stop.  All the attention can be draining by the end of the day, but you can’t help feeling uplifted by all the genuine friendliness.</p>
<p><figure style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1_12825575693_36a6663ab3_b.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Cute, and oh, so curious.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><figure style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1_12670490505_8fa54708b4_b.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Even the dog&#8217;s spinning around to have a look!</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><b>Fresh Fish, a Nap and a Shower</b></p>
<p>Fishermen set out to sea out at dusk and haul in their catch at dawn.  Simple roadside beach shacks offer up generous portions of grilled fish served with rice and vegetables.   The meals are delicious and cheap.  For seaside dining, you’ll pay about half the price of a Big Mac in New York or Paris.</p>
<p>Feel like a short snooze after a big meal?  No problem, restaurants have bamboo napping platforms and comfy couches where you can rest and rejuvenate for an hour or two.</p>
<p>Before hitting the road again, you can also take a refreshing <i>mandi</i> (Indonesian bucket bath) right at the restaurant–it’s completely normal in this part of the world.</p>
<p><b>Test your Limits</b></p>
<p>While this may be the world’s most beautiful coastal road, it’s certainly not the easiest.  The climbs rarely let up and the fierce tropical sun makes everything doubly difficult.  We struggled in spots where the road was not yet paved.  Luckily, locals often came to our aid and gave us a welcome push up the steepest stretches.</p>
<p>If you’re up for a challenge and want to experience one of the world’s most beautiful roads, give the north Sulawesi coastal road a go.</p>
