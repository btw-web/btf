<h1>Then and Now:  Vietnam Revisited</h1>
<p>Your very first visit to a Third World country leaves a big impression.&nbsp; It’s inevitable. &nbsp;A few strong images stick in your mind long after you&#8217;ve settled back into your comfortable First World existence..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbiking/sets/72157628802207665/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 5px solid black;" title="Mandarin Ladies" src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_6671210061_55dfb4ed83_z.jpg" alt="" width="383" height="512"></a></p>
<p>Maybe it’s the “dirt poor locals” who appeared so joyful and content.&nbsp; Or the wide smiles of the hotel staff.&nbsp; Perhaps the crowded streets teeming with humanity .</p>
<p>Or maybe it’s the the overpowering stench of raw sewage, the grubby kids, and the hustlers and scammers that come to mind.</p>
<p>One thing is sure.&nbsp; You never forget the jolt that accompanies the transition from First World to Third.</p>
<h3>First Impressions</h3>
<p>Vietnam was the country of initiation for me.&nbsp; Way back in the mid-90s, when you could actually use the terms First World and Third World without being &nbsp;branded &nbsp;a politically incorrect clod.</p>
<p>My strongest memory of that first developing world travel experience is standing transfixed on the streets of Saigon wondering how on earth I could ever cross to the other side.&nbsp; Even then, traffic was a non-stop succession of scooters. There was no Walk sign or green light to act as my guide.</p>
<p>I watched in wonder as the locals weaved in and out of the traffic, making it safely to the other side.&nbsp; It looked effortless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They just glided between cars and buses and carts.</p>
<p>I thought my chances of mimicking this were slim.&nbsp; Most likely I’d freeze up like a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming vehicle and be flattened by the first bus that came roaring my way.</p>
<p>This wasn’t going to be much of a holiday if I just holed up in my hotel for two weeks until I called a taxi to whisk me back to the airport for my return flight.</p>
<p>Finally, I screwed up the courage to step off the sidewalk.&nbsp; I stuck close to a pack of office workers sauntering across the busy thoroughfare, and what do you know?&nbsp; I made it!</p>
<p>Ever since I’ve been smitten by the travel bug.</p>
<h3>Progress</h3>
<p>A lot has changed in the 15 years that have passed since my first Asia experience.</p>
<p>Not only can I now traverse congested Vietnamese roads with complete confidence, I can even bike&nbsp; them.</p>
<p>In fact biking Vietnam’s not so bad.&nbsp; Or at least it seems that way compared with the crazy conditions on Chinese roads.</p>
<p><figure style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbiking/sets/72157628802207665/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="Arriving in Vietnam, Border crossing at Mon Cai" src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_6671178623_847e2950c1_z.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="328"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">It was cold and rainy when we finally rolled into Vietnam.

<h3>The Easy Life</h3>
<p>Biking Vietnam requires &nbsp;less effort than cycling China for three simple reasons.</p>
<p>First off, Vietnamese is written in a Roman script.&nbsp; That means we’re no longer locked out of the world of words.&nbsp; We can actually decipher the signs.</p>
<p>The first word I learned, in Mong Cai where we crossed over from China, was Nha Nghi.&nbsp; That&#8217;s hotel in Vietnamese.</p>
<p><figure style="width: 289px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_6712607915_19023dcdb5.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="500"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Searching for a hotel couldn't be easier.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>What a difference this one little word has made in our lives.&nbsp; No longer are we subjected to the evening ritual of accosting copious numbers of passersby and pantomiming sleep in order to find accommodation.&nbsp; We simply search out the signs.&nbsp; Nha Nghi: the most useful word in the entire Vietnamese language.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Vietnamese are assertive.&nbsp; Actually, Vietnamese who have little to do with foreign tourists are assertive.&nbsp; Those exposed to foreigners quickly become infected with the <em>aggression bug</em> which has lead to Vietnam’s (well-deserved) reputation as the hassle capital of Asia.</p>
<p>When contact with foreigners is minimal, Vietnamese are assertive.&nbsp; And that’s a good thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Locals earnestly attempt to understand foreigners.&nbsp; Unlike the Chinese, who sometimes act like foreign visitors are invisible, Vietnamese don’t shy away from contact with tourists.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to order lunch but are baffled by the Vietnamese menu, no problem. &nbsp;Expect the proprietor to grab you by the arm and escort you into the kitchen to choose your meal.</p>
<p>Want to buy some dragon fruit from an old lady in the market?&nbsp; You don’t speak a word of her language, and she understands nothing of yours. No problem.</p>
<p>She’ll whip out her calculator and punch in the price or shove a wad of bills in your face to get the point across about how much you owe.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese know how to get things done.&nbsp; I like that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbiking/sets/72157628802207665/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="  aligncenter" style="border: 5px solid black;" title="shopping at a market in Vietnam" src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_6671200441_f408e3bc49_z.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="384"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, Vietnam has yet to experience a Chinese-style&nbsp; &nbsp;bonanza of road building.&nbsp; You want to go south?&nbsp; You got one choice.&nbsp; Take Highway 18.&nbsp; Easy.</p>
<p>We followed 18 South through the usual succession of dreary towns and farming villages.&nbsp; If you think Vietnam is a country dotted with picturesque villages of thatch-roof huts where everybody rides a bicycle and spends their days slaving away in the rice paddies, you’re way out of date.</p>
<p>The industrious Vietnamese have moved on to concrete brick homes, factory jobs and scooters.</p>
<p>Ah the unassuming scooter—the bane of a cyclist’s existence in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; Progress in Vietnam has come at the price of peace.&nbsp; All day long we are subjected to the incessant squawking of these cute contraptions.&nbsp; Beep, beep&#8230;beep, beep… beep beeeep, a constant din fills the air.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><figure style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbiking/sets/72157628802207665/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=" " title="Forever texting in Vietnam" src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1_6692755691_28a5c204ff_z.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="512"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Scooters...gotta hate 'em.</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3>Paradise Promised</h3>
<p>Cat Ba island promises to be a reprieve from all the clatter.&nbsp; Eric has been selling me on the place for weeks.&nbsp; When my whining kicks in (The traffic!&nbsp; The noise!&nbsp; The confusion!), he paints me a picture of a quiet island plopped down in Halong Bay&nbsp; where I can enjoy views of the limestone peaks in the distance.</p>
<p>Cat Ba has undergone a change or two since Eric first visited in 1996.&nbsp; The two family-owned guest houses that he recalls have mushroomed into hundreds of hotels.&nbsp; HUNDREDS.</p>
<p>It’s the off season so we have our pick.&nbsp; Six dollars a night gets us a view of the bay, clean sheets, a hot shower and WiFi.&nbsp; The place is mostly deserted except for a few hardy backpackers.&nbsp; Thankfully, because I doubt I’d stick around when Cat Ba is in full swing, full of boisterous Chinese tourists frequenting the massage parlours.</p>
<p>A couple of days rest and relaxation and we catch the ferry back to the mainland.&nbsp; &nbsp;Cat Ba is no longer the tranquil oasis of Eric’s recollections, and he’s ready to move on.</p>

<h3>Back to the &nbsp;Grind</h3>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the traffic on the highway to Hanoi buzzes by at a frenetic speed.&nbsp; A wide shoulder makes cycling slightly less dangerous, but we’ve constantly got to be on the lookout for scooters coming at us from all directions.&nbsp; In Vietnam the usual rules of the road are, well, more like recommendations or tips, best driving practices if you will, but hardly laws to be meticulously obeyed.</p>

<h3>Last Impressions</h3>
<p>In Hanoi, we settle into the home of Karen, our latest host from Warm Showers.&nbsp; We’re sequestered in an expat ghetto, where foreigners outnumber the locals.&nbsp; There’s an authentic French <em>boulangerie</em> just down the road, three wine shops within walking distance and a couple of grocery stores chock-full of imported goods.</p>
<p>Laos is just a short ride away, and this may well be my last impression from Vietnam.&nbsp; It certainly has little in common with my first impression on that sidewalk in Saigon, way back in the 90s. &nbsp;That&#8217;s progress, I guess.</p>
