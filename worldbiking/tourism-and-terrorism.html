<h1>Tourism and Terrorism</h1>
<p>“Aren’t you afraid of the bombs?”</p>
<p>Cycling through Thailand’s deep south, this troubling enquiry was tossed out multiple times each day.</p>
<p>Sure we were scared!</p>
<p>Who wouldn’t be if they had bothered to read this <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1040.html#safety">warning from the US State Department</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The far south of Thailand has been experiencing almost daily incidents of criminally and politically motivated violence for several years, including incidents attributed to armed local separatist groups. Although the separatist groups have focused primarily on Thai government interests in the southern provinces, some of the recent violence has targeted public and commercial areas, including areas where foreigners may congregate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or this <em>very</em> recent <a href="http://articles.boston.com/2012-04-01/news/31271044_1_hat-yai-second-car-bomb-yala">article found on the Internet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suspected Muslim insurgents staged the most deadly coordinated attacks in years in Thailand’s restive south, killing 14 people and injuring 340 with car bombs that targeted Saturday shoppers and a high-rise hotel frequented by foreign tourists.</p>
<p>A first batch of explosives planted inside a parked pickup truck ripped through an area of restaurants and shops in a busy area of Yala city, a main commercial hub of Thailand’s restive southern provinces, said district police chief Col. Kritsada Kaewchandee.</p>
<p>About 20 minutes later, just as onlookers gathered at the blast site, a second car bomb exploded, causing the majority of casualties. Eleven people were killed and 110 wounded by the blasts.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Travel Warnings: to heed or not to heed</h3>
<p>Alright, so we were well aware of the risks.  This Southern Thailand insurgency may not make many headlines in the rest of the world, but it’s big news in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Just because I’ve visited 16 of the 32 countries topping <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_1764.html">the US State Department’s list of absolute no-go countries</a>, doesn’t mean I’m not a worrier.</p>
<p>I am.  In fact, I’d say I’m a bigger fretter than most.</p>
<p>Dogs barking in the distance will have me flying out of the tent in search of campsite invaders.  If we’re at a hotel for the night and slip out for dinner my mind’s churning away with thoughts of doors left unlocked and thieves whisking away our precious bikes.  And if it’s a lonely stretch of road we’re pedaling, you can bet I’m eyeing each approaching vehicle with suspicion.  Are there terrorists lurking inside?  Kidnappers keen on nabbing cyclists?  Highway Bandits ready to plunder our panniers?</p>
<h3>I just can&#8217;t help it!  Or can I?</h3>
<p>All ridiculous thoughts.  I know that.  But sometimes there’s just nothing I can do to stop their flow.</p>
<p>What I can do, however, is consciously decide to override their influence.</p>
<p>Ignore the emotions and weigh up the risks with the logical half of my mind.</p>
<p>And logic told me that the chance of getting caught up in the southern Thailand insurgency was very, very low.</p>
<p>As this <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/wrong-about-risk-blame-your-brain/">New York Times article</a> points out “…we overestimate the odds of dreadful but infrequent events and underestimate how risky ordinary events are.”</p>
<h3>A mad dash to Malaysia</h3>
<p>That’s the mantra I repeated as we biked past the bombed out buildings in Narathiwat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>we overestimate the odds of dreadful but infrequent events</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>we overestimate the odds of dreadful but infrequent events</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>we overestimate the odds of dreadful but infrequent events</strong></p>
<p>We did, however, take heed when a local guy in Narathiwat suggested we bike like crazy to cross the border into Malaysia that very day.</p>
<p>I gave it my all but there was just no way my weary legs could conquer those final 30 kilometers to the frontier before sunset.</p>
<p>Enter the friendly Thai police.  And there are plenty of them in that part of the country.  Throwing up checkpoints and attempting to keep order.  They are there to serve.  And serve they did.</p>

<p>No, we couldn’t camp at their compound (although we had spent the previous night behind barbed wire at another military compound) but they would lead us to a safe place to sleep.  And FREE, they insisted.</p>
<p>We ended up at an abandoned seaside resort.  Abandoned, of course, because terrorism and tourism just don’t mix.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">

<p>Alright, the resort was <em>mostly</em> abandoned.  A guard sized us up at the gate and a friendly caretaker showed us to the one and only room that was ready to receive guests.</p>
<p>The following day we rolled across the border into Malaysia and let out a collective sigh of relief.   No terrorists on this side of the border!</p>
