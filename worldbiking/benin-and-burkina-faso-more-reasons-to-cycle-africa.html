<h1>Benin and Burkina Faso: more reasons to cycle Africa</h1>
<h3>This is a Guest Post by Salva Rguez.</h3>
<h3>BENIN.</h3>
<div>1. To visit the Tamberma people. They live in the north, some  in Benin, some in Togo, in a remote area that you can cross without a  visa. They have the most beautiful &#8216;mud house-castles&#8217; of Africa. Really  beautiful, the scenery too. And most of them are still animist, friendly,  living in an old style without dressing sometimes. If you spend some time  with them, they most likely will invite you to stay and sacrifice  something to eat for you. It is a tradition, you are a  guest, and they take seriously that honor.</div>
<div></div>

</div>
<div></div>
<div>2. The Vodoo  ceremonies. Even the pretty scary side of this religion, ceremonies are  shocking. I still remember a guy besides me getting white eyes and  falling back like a plank; they told me he will arise within 3 days&#8230;  Anyway, I would not recommend joining a ceremony in the night and in a  remote place. Absolutely not.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Body parts from a white person are really  appreciated, and I am not joking at all.</div>

<h4>3.Remoteness</h4>
<div>The North of the  country is remote, same as the almost twin brother, Togo.</div>
<div>Green  scenery and traditional people. You can feel a lot of animist culture,  despite the pressure from Christians and Muslims. Relax and enjoy the  differences, they may dress in rags but many of them have gold in their  heart.</div>
<div></div>
<h4>4. The kings.</h4>
<div>Benin is a country where kings still  exist. They do not have legal power anymore, but they are spectacular,  and highly respected by their people. As a traveler on  a bike, and a westerner, you&#8217;ll get a lot of chances to be welcomed by  them. They do have a throne!</div>
<div></div>
<h4></h4>

<h4>5. Beninouise beer.</h4>
<p>Not a bad  chance in this part of Africa. And at last, as in any other country in  Africa, you will experience the countryside life: how life is when there  is no money to spend, and even if you have it, there is not too much to  do with it. How people behave, how they organize life and family, how  they enjoy&#8230; you may be surprised.</p>

<h3>BURKINA FASO.</h3>
<h4>1. The Mossi people in the north.</h4>
<div>Very interesting, tribal, with strong scarifications and friendly.</div>
<div></div>
<h4>2.  The Lobi people in the south, bordering with Ghana and Ivory Coast.</h4>
<div>Still pretty high  percentage are animist, but you must leave the main roads. They have  interesting &#8216;family-houses&#8217; and lots of traditions and rituals. You can  be stopped in the middle of nowhere by armed young boys dressed with  nothing but feathers.</div>

<h4>3. To see elephants for free.</h4>
<div>There is an unfenced  National Park  in the center with elephants. There is a river  in the park, and it seems that the elephants cross it every afternoon. I  cannot say that it will happen for sure, but I saw them. Just make sure  the rangers do not see you, because there is a &#8216;lodge&#8217; with a view over  the river that makes money with this.</div>
<div></div>

<figure id="attachment_1362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1362" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-1362" title="elephant" src="http://www.worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/elephant.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="http://www.worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/elephant.jpg 600w, http://www.worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/elephant-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1362" class="wp-caption-text">Here&#39;s your chance to get an up close view of an elephant.

<h4>4. Experience the dark side of international aid.</h4>
<div>The international community has created a big mess with NGOs giving and  giving without any planning.</div>
<div>More than the half of the country&#8217;s budget  comes from International aid, and everyday you will experience hundreds  of children and adults asking you for money and gifts, just because you  are westerner.</div>
<div></div>
<h4>5. Learn about what is necessary and what is not.</h4>
<p>It is pretty  relaxing to travel on secundary roads, have a stop to drink local millet  beer, or delicious lamp roasted in a rusty plank and served on cement  paper&#8230; pretty poor and basic life, though relaxing.</p>
<p>Free of luxury  necessities.</p>
<p>You do not get much more that basic food, water from pumps  and bucket bath with a place to pitch your tent in the evening. And you  will learn that they are happier with this &#8216;poor&#8217; life, than most of  your friends surrounded by expensive stuff.</p>
<p>I would not say that scenery  is beautiful, but it is interesting. Mix of desert and savanna, with a  lot of sand in places, but still trees.</p>
<p>Good country to realize how  bloody lucky we, Westerners, are. May also good to open the mind to  other realities.</p>

<div>Salva was a teacher taking many  holidays cycling trips all over  the world.  One day he asked himself why he has to live three months a  year the life he really wants  to live all the time.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Since he did not find any suitable answer, he left for a bicycle   journey with no return ticket.  That was January 2006.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So far, he has  cycled in Africa and Asia, made a treasure of  hundreds of friends, had  pretty good experiences, went through useful  difficulties, opened his  mind and heart, and learnt some new things.</div>
<div></div>
<div>He thinks he is ready to  come back home now and see friends and  family, share some things with  them and maybe start a family.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But  first he wants to try to cross America.</div>
