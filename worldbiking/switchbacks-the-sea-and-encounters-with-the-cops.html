<h1>Switchbacks, the Sea and Encounters with the Cops</h1>
<p>After Hokkaido, we had just a month to pedal the length of Japan&#8217;s  main island of Honshu.  Our visas were due to expire and we had a ferry to catch to Korea.</p>
<p>Pounding out 2,000 kilometers in 30 days wouldn&#8217;t normally be a massive challenge.  Except in Japan.  Sure, the GPS had eased our navigation challenges, but Japan&#8217;s labyrinth of roads still caused a few headaches.    Add to that the endless hills (and one massive mountain) and you&#8217;ll get an idea way progress was so slow..  And those rain showers that greeted us on arrival back in June?  They&#8217;ve stuck with us all summer long.</p>
<p>There was little time for lingering.  Something told us the Japanese would be far less lenient than the Sudanese when it comes to visa overstays.</p>
<p>Thankfully we made it to the ferry with two days to spare and are now getting our first taste of Korea (we like it, in spite of the rain!).</p>
<p>With all rushing around last month seems like a bit of a blur.  Here are some of the highlights in an easily digestible photographic form:</p>
<figure style="width: 645px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9568792994_44b12b51a5_b.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="431" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Well, why not start off with the highlight of our entire Japan tour:  reaching the top of the highest road in Japan&#8211;the 2,700 meter Norikura Skyline Road.  It was a beautiful ride up on an almost traffic free road.  Private vehicles are prohibited on the pass and we had only the tour buses to contend with.  The big shock came when we got to the top of the pass and two heartless officials told us we&#8217;d have to go back down the way we&#8217;d come!  No way!  Closed road to cyclists?  IMPOSSIBLE&gt; Buses were passing so we boldly ignored the officials and flew down the other side.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 645px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9688600991_63629b76d5_b.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="387" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Camping was another definite highlight in Japan! Alright, it was soggy at times but most nights we managed to find a quiet park, a pretty site tucked in the mountains or sometimes even a stunning spot next to the sea.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 645px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9522264756_5d096b25b7_b.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="431" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Cops really are your friends in Japan. This guy pulled over to direct us to a dry spot to spend the night and warn us of a fast approaching tropical storm. In another more serious incident, we found ourselves surrounded by 6 squad cars and 11 frantic police officers. A convenience store manager had called in the force when he found us &#8216;stealing electricity&#8217; in front of his shop. We were seriously confused because we assumed since the establishment was offering a free WiFi spot, plugging in the computers wouldn&#8217;t be a problem. Luckily we didn&#8217;t get carted off to jail. So remember folks, the next time you want to plug in an electrical device, ASK FIRST!</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 645px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9670457348_94c60ecbe0_b.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="431" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">After Australia and New Zealand, it takes a lot to impress us when it comes to coastal scenery. Japan&#8217;s got a few spots where the road winds around the coast and you can peer over the edge and watch the waves crash into the sheer rock face. This was one of the rare days of pure, unadulterated sunshine.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 615px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9691725830_e8a4c1ab11_b.jpg" alt="" width="615" height="922" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A moment to take in the scenery before the next rain shower hits.</figcaption></figure>

The meticulous care in presentation is striking.</figcaption></figure>

<figure style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9565999719_3f93df442f_b.jpg" alt="" width="922" height="385" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">And (thanks to our new GPS skills) we discovered many quiet backroads snaking through the countryside.</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 615px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" " src="http://worldbiking.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9673627445_e2348f81b8_b.jpg" alt="" width="615" height="922" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Gardening is the national past time for retirees. Old women in oversized bonnets can be seen hoeing fields, planting rice and pulling weeds on small plots of land. The produce is sold in local cooperatives and helps top-up their pensions.</figcaption></figure>

Rain to the very end! Next time we tour Japan it will definitely not be in the summer.</figcaption></figure>
